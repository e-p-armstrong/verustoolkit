    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    What is the purpose of the `validateaddress` command in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    The `validateaddress` command is used to return information about a given transparent
    address in Verus. It checks if the address is valid and provides additional information
    about the address if it is valid.



    **QUESTION:**

    What are the arguments required for the `validateaddress` command?


    **ANSWER:**

    The `validateaddress` command requires only one argument, which is the transparent
    address to be validated, represented as a string.



    **QUESTION:**

    What information does the `validateaddress` command return about a valid address?


    **ANSWER:**

    If the address is valid, the `validateaddress` command returns a JSON object with
    the following properties:


    * `address`: The Verus or PBaaS address being validated.

    * `scriptPubKey`: The hex encoded scriptPubKey generated by the address.

    * `ismine`: A boolean indicating whether the address belongs to the user or not.

    * `isscript`: A boolean indicating whether the key is a script or not.

    * `pubkey`: The hex value of the raw public key.

    * `iscompressed`: A boolean indicating whether the address is compressed or not.

    * `account`: The account associated with the address (DEPRECATED).



    **QUESTION:**

    How can I use the `validateaddress` command to check the validity of a specific
    address?


    **ANSWER:**

    You can use the `validateaddress` command in the Verus CLI by running the following
    command:

    ```

    verus validateaddress "RTZMZHDFSTFQst8XmX2dR4DaH87cEUs3gC"

    ```

    Replace `RTZMZHDFSTFQst8XmX2dR4DaH87cEUs3gC` with the address you want to validate.


    Alternatively, you can use the Verus RPC API by sending a JSON-RPC request to
    the Verus server:

    ```

    curl --user myusername --data-binary ''{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method":
    "validateaddress", "params": ["RTZMZHDFSTFQst8XmX2dR4DaH87cEUs3gC"] }'' -H ''content-type:

    **User:**

    I''m trying to understand the `validateaddress` command in Verus. What is its
    purpose?


    **AI Assistant:**

    The `validateaddress` command is used to return information about a given transparent
    address in Verus. It checks if the address is valid and provides additional information
    about the address if it is valid. Would you like to know more about how to use
    it or what information it returns?


    **User:**

    Yeah, that sounds helpful. What are the arguments required for the `validateaddress`
    command?


    **AI Assistant:**

    The `validateaddress` command requires only one argument, which is the transparent
    address to be validated, represented as a string. So, you just need to provide
    the address you want to validate.


    **User:**

    Got it! What information does the `validateaddress` command return about a valid
    address?


    **AI Assistant:**

    If the address is valid, the `validateaddress` command returns a JSON object with
    several properties. These include the address itself, the scriptPubKey, whether
    the address belongs to the user or not, whether the key is a script or not, the
    raw public key, whether the address is compressed or not, and the account associated
    with the address (although that last one is deprecated).


    **User:**

    That sounds like a lot of useful information. How can I actually use the `validateaddress`
    command to check the validity of a specific address?


    **AI Assistant:**

    You can use the `validateaddress` command in the Verus CLI by running a command
    like this:

    ```

    verus validateaddress "RTZMZHDFSTFQst8XmX2dR4DaH87cEUs3gC"

    ```

    Just replace `RTZMZHDFSTFQst8XmX2dR4DaH87cEUs3gC` with the address you want to
    validate.


    Alternatively, you can use the Verus RPC API by sending a JSON-RPC request to
    the Verus server. The request would look something like this:

    ```

    curl --user myusername --data-binary ''{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method":
    "validateaddress", "params": ["RTZMZHDFSTFQst8XmX2dR4DaH87cEUs3gC"] }'' -H ''content-type:
    text/plain;'' http://127.0.0.1:27486/

    ```

    Let me know if you have any more questions about using the `validateaddress` command!'
