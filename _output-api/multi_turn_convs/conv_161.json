    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to figure out how to get the balance of an address in Verus. What is the purpose of the `z_getbalance` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getbalance` command returns the balance of a transparent or private address belonging to the node's wallet. Do you have any other questions about `z_getbalance`?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually. What are the arguments required by the `z_getbalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getbalance` command requires two arguments:\n\n1. \"address\" (string): The selected address, which can be a transparent or private address and include z*, R*, and i* wildcards.\n2. minconf (numeric, optional, default=1): The minimum number of confirmations required for a transaction to be included in the balance calculation.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the result of the `z_getbalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `z_getbalance` command is the total amount in VRSC received for the specified address, returned as a numeric value.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `z_getbalance` command to get the total amount received by an address with at least 5 blocks confirmed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_getbalance` command to get the total amount received by an address with at least 5 blocks confirmed by specifying the `minconf` argument as 5, like this:\n\n`verus z_getbalance \"myaddress\" 5`\n\nAlternatively, you can use a JSON RPC call:\n\n`curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_getbalance\", \"params\": [\"myaddress\", 5] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`\n\nDo you have any other questions about `z_getbalance`?\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing. What's the caution when using the `z_getbalance` command with an incoming viewing key?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using the `z_getbalance` command with an incoming viewing key, there is a caution that spends cannot be detected, and so the returned balance may be larger than the actual balance. Keep that in mind!",
