    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `gettransaction` command in Verus, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. Can you tell me more about its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `gettransaction` command is used to retrieve detailed information about a specific transaction in the wallet, identified by its transaction ID (txid). It's a great tool for getting a closer look at a particular transaction.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds useful. What arguments does the `gettransaction` command require?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `gettransaction` command requires two arguments:\n\n1. `\"txid\"` (string, required): The transaction ID of the transaction to retrieve information about.\n2. `\"includeWatchonly\"` (bool, optional, default=false): Whether to include watch-only addresses in the balance calculation and details.\n\nSo, you need to provide the transaction ID and optionally specify whether to include watch-only addresses.\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of information does the `gettransaction` command return?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `gettransaction` command returns a JSON object containing detailed information about the transaction, including:\n\n* `amount`: The transaction amount in VRSC.\n* `confirmations`: The number of confirmations.\n* `blockhash`: The block hash.\n* `blockindex`: The block index.\n* `blocktime`: The time in seconds since epoch (1 Jan 1970 GMT).\n* `txid`: The transaction ID.\n* `time`: The transaction time in seconds since epoch (1 Jan 1970 GMT).\n* `timereceived`: The time received in seconds since epoch (1 Jan 1970 GMT).\n* `details`: An array of objects containing information about each output of the transaction.\n* `vjoinsplit`: An array of objects containing information about each vjoin/split of the transaction.\n* `hex`: The raw data for the transaction.\n\nIt provides a comprehensive overview of the transaction.\n\n**User:**\nI noticed that the `gettransaction` result contains a `vjoinsplit` array. What does that contain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `vjoinsplit` array in the `gettransaction` result contains an array of objects, each describing a vjoin/split of the transaction. Each object contains the following information:\n\n* `anchor`: The Merkle root of the note commitment tree.\n* `nullifiers`: An array of nullifiers of input notes.\n* `commitments`: An array of note commitments for note outputs.\n* `macs`: An array of message authentication tags.\n* `vpub_old`: The amount removed from the transparent value pool.\n* `vpub_new`: The amount added to the transparent value pool.\n\nThis provides detailed information about the vjoin/split operations involved in the transaction.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about `gettransaction` or Verus in general!",
