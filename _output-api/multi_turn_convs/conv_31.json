    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the `getaddressesbyaccount` method in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getaddressesbyaccount` method returns a list of addresses associated with a given account. It's a useful tool for managing your accounts and addresses in Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. What's the required format for the \"account\" argument when using the `getaddressesbyaccount` method?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"account\" argument must be set to an empty string (`\"\"`) to represent the default account. Passing any other string will result in an error. So, make sure to use an empty string when calling this method.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What's the format of the result returned by the `getaddressesbyaccount` method?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result is a JSON array of strings, where each string is a VRSC address associated with the given account. So, you'll get a list of addresses in a JSON format.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. How can I use the `getaddressesbyaccount` method using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getaddressesbyaccount` method using the command line by running the following command: `verus getaddressesbyaccount \"\"`. Just make sure to replace `verus` with the actual command to access the Verus CLI on your system.",
