    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with the `z_getnewaddress` command in Verus. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getnewaddress` command returns a new shielded address for receiving payments in Verus. Do you have any other questions about this command or its usage?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What type of address is returned by default when using the `z_getnewaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBy default, the `z_getnewaddress` command returns a Sapling address. Would you like to know more about Sapling addresses or the other types of addresses that can be returned?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that would be great! What are the possible types of addresses that can be specified as an argument to the `z_getnewaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe possible types of addresses that can be specified as an argument to the `z_getnewaddress` command are \"sprout\" and \"sapling\". You can choose the type of address you want to generate by specifying it as an argument. Do you have any questions about how to do that?\n\n**User:**\nExactly! How can I use the `z_getnewaddress` command to get a new Sapling address using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_getnewaddress` command to get a new Sapling address by running the following command: `verus z_getnewaddress sapling`. This will return a new Sapling address for receiving payments. Would you like to know how to do this using curl instead?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, I do! How can I use the `z_getnewaddress` command to get a new shielded address using curl?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_getnewaddress` command to get a new shielded address by running the following curl command: `curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_getnewaddress\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`. This will also return a new shielded address for receiving payments. Do you have any more questions about using the `z_getnewaddress` command or Verus in general?",
