    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `getidentitieswithrevocation` command in Verus. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getidentitieswithrevocation` command is used to retrieve a list of identities where a specified ID or i-address is the revocation authority. This command allows you to search for identities based on their revocation authority, with optional filters for block heights and active ID UTXOs.\n\nDo you have any other questions about this command, like what arguments it takes or what the result looks like?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually. What are the required and optional arguments for the `getidentitieswithrevocation` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getidentitieswithrevocation` command requires one argument, `identityid`, which is a string representing the ID or i-address to search for as the revocation authority. The command also has three optional arguments:\n\n* `fromheight`: a number specifying the block height from which to start searching for qualified identities (default is 0).\n* `toheight`: a number specifying the block height up to which to search for qualified identities (default is 0, meaning no limit).\n* `unspent`: a boolean indicating whether to only return active ID UTXOs as of the current block height (default is false).\n\nDo you have any other questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the format of the result returned by the `getidentitieswithrevocation` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getidentitieswithrevocation` command returns an array of objects, where each object represents a matching identity. Each identity object has an additional member called `txout`, which contains the transaction hash and output index.\n\nDo you have any other questions about this command, like how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, one more. How can I use the `getidentitieswithrevocation` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getidentitieswithrevocation` command in Verus by running it in the command line or by using a curl command with JSON-RPC. Here are two examples:\n\n1. Command line:\n```\nverus getidentitieswithrevocation '{\"identityid\":\"idori-address\",\"fromheight\":height,\"toheight\":height,\"unspent\":false}'\n```\n2. Curl command:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getidentitieswithrevocation\", \"params\": [{\"identityid\":\"idori-address\",\"fromheight\":height,\"toheight\":height,\"unspent\":false}]} 'H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nI hope that helps!",
