    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any Verus-related questions. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing with the `importaddress` command, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `importaddress` command in Verus allows you to add an address or script (in hex) that can be watched as if it were in your wallet, but cannot be used to spend. It's a useful tool for tracking addresses without having control over them. Do you have any specific questions about how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually. What arguments does the `importaddress` command require?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `importaddress` command requires at least one argument, which is the \"address\" (a string). There are two optional arguments: \"label\" (a string, defaulting to an empty string) and \"rescan\" (a boolean, defaulting to true). The \"label\" argument is useful for identifying the address, and the \"rescan\" argument determines whether the wallet should be rescanned for transactions after importing the address.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens when I set \"rescan\" to true when using the `importaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen \"rescan\" is set to true (which is the default), the wallet will be rescanned for transactions, which can take several minutes to complete. This allows the imported address to be fully synchronized with the wallet. Keep in mind that this can take some time, depending on the size of your wallet and the number of transactions.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. How can I import an address with a label without rescanning the wallet using the `importaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo import an address with a label without rescanning the wallet, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus importaddress \"myaddress\" \"testing\" false\n```\nThis command imports the address \"myaddress\" with the label \"testing\" and sets \"rescan\" to false, so the wallet will not be rescanned.",
