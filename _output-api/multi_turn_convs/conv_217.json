    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to assist you with any questions you might have about Verus. How can I help?\n\n**User:**\nI'm playing around with the Verus CLI and I'm curious about the `getreceivedbyaddress` command. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getreceivedbyaddress` command returns the total amount of VRSC received by a given VRSC address in transactions with at least a specified number of confirmations. Would you like to know more about the arguments and result of this command?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that would be great! What are the arguments for the `getreceivedbyaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getreceivedbyaddress` command takes two arguments:\n\n1. \"VRSC_address\" (string, required): The VRSC address for transactions.\n2. minconf (numeric, optional, default=1): Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.\n\nDo you have any questions about these arguments, or would you like to know more about the result of the command?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the result of the `getreceivedbyaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `getreceivedbyaddress` command is the total amount in VRSC received at the specified address, which is a numeric value.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `getreceivedbyaddress` command to get the total amount received by an address, including unconfirmed transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getreceivedbyaddress` command with a `minconf` value of 0 to include unconfirmed transactions. For example: `verus getreceivedbyaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 0`\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `getreceivedbyaddress` command to get the total amount received by an address with at least 6 confirmations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getreceivedbyaddress` command with a `minconf` value of 6 to only include transactions with at least 6 confirmations. For example: `verus getreceivedbyaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 6`\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about Verus or its commands!",
