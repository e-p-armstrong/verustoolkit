    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been playing around with the Verus CLI and I came across the `getidentityhistory` command. What's the purpose of it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getidentityhistory` command is used to retrieve the history of an identity on the Verus blockchain. It returns a list of transactions related to the specified identity, filtered by height range and with optional proof of ID.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful! What are the required and optional arguments for the `getidentityhistory` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required argument is the identity name followed by \"@\" or i-address (`\"name@ || iid\"`). The optional arguments are: \n- `heightstart`: specifies the starting height for the transaction history (default=0).\n- `heightend`: specifies the ending height for the transaction history (default=0, which means max height). A value of -1 includes transactions from the mempool.\n- `txproofs`: a boolean flag to include proof of ID in the response (default=false).\n- `txproofheight`: specifies the height from which to generate a proof (default=\"height\").\n\n**User:**\nI see. How can I use the `getidentityhistory` command to retrieve the transaction history of an identity, including proof of ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getidentityhistory` command with the `txproofs` argument set to `true` to include proof of ID in the response. For example:\n```\nverus getidentityhistory \"name@\" true\n```\nThis command will return the transaction history of the identity \"name@\", including proof of ID.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really useful! Can I use the `getidentityhistory` command to retrieve transactions from the mempool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use the `getidentityhistory` command to retrieve transactions from the mempool by setting the `heightend` argument to -1. For example:\n```\nverus getidentityhistory \"name@\" 0 -1\n```\nThis command will return the transaction history of the identity \"name@\", including transactions from the mempool.",
