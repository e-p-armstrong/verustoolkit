    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the `refundfailedlaunch` command in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `refundfailedlaunch` command is used to refund any funds sent to a chain if they are eligible for refund. It attempts to refund all transactions for all contributors. Do you have any more questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually. What's the required argument for the `refundfailedlaunch` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required argument for the `refundfailedlaunch` command is the `currencyid`, which can be either an iaddress or the full chain name.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `refundfailedlaunch` command to refund contributions to a chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `refundfailedlaunch` command to refund contributions to a chain by running the following command:\n```\nverus refundfailedlaunch \"currencyid\"\n```\nReplace `\"currencyid\"` with the actual iaddress or full chain name of the chain you want to refund contributions to.\n\n**User:**\nIs there an alternative way to use the `refundfailedlaunch` command, other than using the Verus command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can also use the `refundfailedlaunch` command using a JSON-RPC request. Here's an example:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"refundfailedlaunch\", \"params\": [\"currencyid\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nReplace `\"myusername\"` with your actual username and `\"currencyid\"` with the actual iaddress or full chain name of the chain you want to refund contributions to.",
