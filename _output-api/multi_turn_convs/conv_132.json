    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with the `prioritisetransaction` command in Verus, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. Can you explain its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `prioritisetransaction` command allows you to adjust the priority of a specific transaction in the transaction selection algorithm, making it more or less likely to be included in a mined block. This is done by modifying the transaction's priority and fee values, without actually changing the transaction itself. Would you like to know more about the required arguments for this command?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that would be helpful. What are the required arguments for the `prioritisetransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `prioritisetransaction` command requires three arguments:\n\n1. `txid`: The transaction ID of the transaction you want to modify.\n2. `priority delta`: A numeric value that adds or subtracts from the transaction's priority.\n3. `fee delta`: A numeric value (in satoshis) that adds or subtracts from the transaction's fee.\n\nDo you have any questions about how the transaction selection algorithm calculates the priority of a transaction?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I was wondering about that. How does the transaction selection algorithm calculate the priority of a transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe transaction selection algorithm calculates the priority of a transaction using the following formula: `coinage * value_in_satoshis / txsize`. This means that transactions with higher coinage, value, and smaller sizes are considered higher priority. Would you like to know more about the effect of the `fee delta` argument on the transaction?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I'm curious about that. What is the effect of the `fee delta` argument on the transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `fee delta` argument does not actually change the fee paid by the transaction. Instead, it modifies the fee value that the transaction selection algorithm considers when deciding which transactions to include in a block. This allows you to simulate the effect of a higher or lower fee without actually changing the transaction.",
