    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `submitblock` command in Verus. What is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `submitblock` command is used to attempt to submit a new block to the Verus network. It's a way to introduce a new block to the network, which can then be verified and added to the blockchain by other nodes.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. What are the possible results of the `submitblock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe possible results of the `submitblock` command are:\n\n1. \"duplicate\" - node already has a valid copy of the block\n2. \"duplicate-invalid\" - node already has the block, but it is invalid\n3. \"duplicate-inconclusive\" - node already has the block, but has not validated it\n4. \"inconclusive\" - node has not validated the block, it may not be on the node's current best chain\n5. \"rejected\" - block was rejected as invalid\n\nThese results indicate whether the block was accepted, rejected, or if the node already has a copy of the block.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `submitblock` command with the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `submitblock` command with the Verus CLI by running the following command:\n```\nverus submitblock \"mydata\"\n```\nReplace \"mydata\" with the hex-encoded block data you want to submit.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how can I use the `submitblock` command with curl?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `submitblock` command with curl by running the following command:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"submitblock\", \"params\": [\"mydata\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nReplace \"myusername\" with your Verus username, \"mydata\" with the hex-encoded block data you want to submit, and \"http://127.0.0.1:27486/\" with the URL of your Verus node.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about the `submitblock` command or Verus in general!",
