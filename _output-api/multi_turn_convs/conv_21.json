    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `getcurrencybalance` command, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencybalance` command returns the balance in all currencies of a taddr or zaddr belonging to the node's wallet. It's a handy tool for checking the balance of a specific address.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds useful. What arguments can I pass to the `getcurrencybalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencybalance` command takes four arguments:\n\n1. \"address\" (string) - The selected address, which can be a transparent or private address and include z*, R*, and i* wildcards.\n2. minconf (numeric, optional, default=1) - Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.\n3. friendlynames (boolean, optional, default=true) - Use friendly names instead of i-addresses.\n4. includeshared (bool, optional, default=false) - Include outputs that can also be spent by others.\n\nThese arguments give you some flexibility in how you use the command.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the result of the `getcurrencybalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `getcurrencybalance` command is the total amount in VRSC received for the specified address.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `getcurrencybalance` command to get the total amount received by an address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEasy one! You can use the `getcurrencybalance` command to get the total amount received by an address by running the following command:\n\n```\nverus getcurrencybalance \"myaddress\"\n```\n\nJust replace \"myaddress\" with the actual address you want to check.\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I want to get the total amount received by an address with at least a certain number of confirmations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencybalance` command to get the total amount received by an address with at least a certain number of confirmations by running the following command:\n\n```\nverus getcurrencybalance \"myaddress\" 5\n```\n\nReplace \"myaddress\" with the actual address you want to check, and \"5\" with the number of confirmations you want to require.\n\n**User:**\nI've been using the command-line interface, but how can I use the `getcurrencybalance` command as a JSON RPC call?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencybalance` command as a JSON RPC call by running the following command:\n\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getcurrencybalance\", \"params\": [\"myaddress\", 5] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\nReplace \"myusername\" with your actual username, \"myaddress\" with the actual address you want to check, and \"5\" with the number of confirmations you want to require.",
