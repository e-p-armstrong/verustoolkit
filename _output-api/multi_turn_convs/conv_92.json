    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with the `zcrawjoinsplit` command in Verus. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `zcrawjoinsplit` command is used to splice a joinsplit into a raw transaction. It takes inputs and outputs as JSON objects, and returns an object with encrypted notes and a raw transaction output. Do you have any specific questions about how to use it or what it does?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What is the format of the inputs and outputs for the `zcrawjoinsplit` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe inputs for the `zcrawjoinsplit` command are a JSON object mapping `{note: zcsecretkey,...}`, and the outputs are a JSON object mapping `{zcaddr: value,...}`. Let me know if you have any more questions about the format or how to use it!\n\n**User:**\nI've seen `vpub_old` and `vpub_new` mentioned in the context of the `zcrawjoinsplit` command. What's their role?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `vpub_old` and `vpub_new` values are globally public and are used to move transparent value into or out of the confidential value store, respectively. They play an important part in the joinsplit process.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the caller's responsibility when using the `zcrawjoinsplit` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe caller is responsible for delivering the output `enc1` and `enc2` to the appropriate recipients, as well as signing `rawtxout` and ensuring it is mined. It's important to make sure these steps are taken care of to complete the process successfully.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, what can I expect as output from the `zcrawjoinsplit` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe output of the `zcrawjoinsplit` command is an object with three properties: `\"encryptednote1\"`, `\"encryptednote2\"`, and `\"rawtxn\"`. This output is the result of the joinsplit process and can be used for further processing or transmission.",
