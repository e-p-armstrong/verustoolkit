    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you with any questions you may have about Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThanks! I was wondering, what is the purpose of the `listreceivedbyaddress` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listreceivedbyaddress` command is used to list the balances of receiving addresses in Verus. It returns a list of objects, each containing information about a receiving address, including the address itself, the account it belongs to, the total amount received, and the number of confirmations of the most recent transaction. Do you have any other questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was wondering what optional arguments can be passed to the `listreceivedbyaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listreceivedbyaddress` command takes three optional arguments:\n\n1. `minconf`: The minimum number of confirmations before payments are included. The default value is 1.\n2. `includeempty`: A boolean indicating whether to include addresses that haven't received any payments. The default value is false.\n3. `includeWatchonly`: A boolean indicating whether to include watchonly addresses (see 'importaddress'). The default value is false.\n\nDo you have any other questions about these arguments?\n\n**User:**\nWhat information is returned by the `listreceivedbyaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listreceivedbyaddress` command returns a list of objects, each containing the following information:\n\n* `involvesWatchonly`: A boolean indicating whether imported addresses were involved in the transaction.\n* `address`: The receiving address.\n* `account`: The account of the receiving address (DEPRECATED).\n* `amount`: The total amount in VRSC received by the address.\n* `confirmations`: The number of confirmations of the most recent transaction included.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the returned information?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `listreceivedbyaddress` command to list all receiving addresses, including those that haven't received any payments?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `listreceivedbyaddress` command with the `includeempty` argument set to `true` to include addresses that haven't received any payments. For example:\n```\nverus listreceivedbyaddress 1 true\n```\nThis command will list all receiving addresses, including those that haven't received any payments, with a minimum of 1 confirmation.",
