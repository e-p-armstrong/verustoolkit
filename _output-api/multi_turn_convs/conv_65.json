    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the Verus commands, and I'm not quite sure what the `estimatepriority` command does. Can you explain it to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `estimatepriority` command estimates the approximate priority a zero-fee transaction needs to begin confirmation within a specified number of blocks. It's a useful tool for understanding how to get your transactions confirmed efficiently.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What arguments does the `estimatepriority` command take?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `estimatepriority` command takes one argument: `nblocks`, which is a numeric value representing the number of blocks within which the transaction is expected to begin confirmation.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What's the result of the `estimatepriority` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `estimatepriority` command is a numeric value representing the estimated priority a zero-fee transaction needs to begin confirmation within the specified number of blocks. If not enough transactions and blocks have been observed to make an estimate, the command returns -1.0.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. Let's say I want to estimate the priority of a zero-fee transaction that needs to begin confirmation within 6 blocks. How would I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `estimatepriority` command to estimate the priority of a zero-fee transaction that needs to begin confirmation within 6 blocks by running the following command: `verus estimatepriority 6`.",
