    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the `listaddressgroupings` command in Verus. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listaddressgroupings` command lists groups of addresses that have had their common ownership made public by common use as inputs or as the resulting change in past transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. What is the format of the result returned by the `listaddressgroupings` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `listaddressgroupings` command is a list of lists, where each inner list contains objects with the following properties:\n* `address`: a string representing the VRSC address\n* `amount`: a numeric value representing the amount in VRSC\n* `account`: an optional string representing the account (DEPRECATED)\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `listaddressgroupings` command in the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `listaddressgroupings` command in the command line by simply running `verus listaddressgroupings`.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how can I use the `listaddressgroupings` command with the JSON-RPC API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `listaddressgroupings` command with the JSON-RPC API by sending a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:27486/` with the following JSON data:\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\",\n  \"id\": \"curltest\",\n  \"method\": \"listaddressgroupings\",\n  \"params\": []\n}\n```\nYou can use tools like `curl` to send the request.",
