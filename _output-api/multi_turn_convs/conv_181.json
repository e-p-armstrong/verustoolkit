    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with some Verus commands and I'm not sure what `zcrawreceive` does. Can you explain it to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `zcrawreceive` command is used to decrypt an encrypted note and check if the coin commitments are present in the blockchain. The command takes three arguments: the zero-knowledge secret key, the encrypted note, and outputs a JSON object with three properties: the amount, the decrypted note plaintext, and a boolean indicating whether the coin commitments exist in the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What's the format of the output from `zcrawreceive`? I want to make sure I understand what I'm looking at.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe output of the `zcrawreceive` command is a JSON object with three properties:\n\n* `amount`: the value of the decrypted note\n* `note`: the plaintext of the decrypted note\n* `exists`: a boolean indicating whether the coin commitments are present in the blockchain\n\nSo, when you run the command, you'll get a JSON object with these three properties, giving you information about the decrypted note and its presence on the blockchain.",
