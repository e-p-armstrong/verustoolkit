    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus and PBaaS chains. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to define a PBaaS chain, and I'm not sure about some of the properties. What's the purpose of the \"expiryheight\" property?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"expiryheight\" property specifies the block height at which the transaction expires. If not provided, it defaults to the current block height plus 20.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the \"startblock\" property?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"startblock\" property specifies the VRSC block that must be notarized into block 1 of the PBaaS chain. If not provided, it defaults to the \"expiryheight\".\n\n**User:**\nAnd what's the \"endblock\" property used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"endblock\" property specifies the block height at which the chain or currency is intended to end its life. If set to 0, the chain or currency will not have an end.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the \"conversions\" property?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"conversions\" property specifies the pre-launch conversion ratio overrides. It is a list of strings representing the conversion ratios, and must be the same size as the \"currencies\" list.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I specify the minimum and maximum amounts in each currency required to launch a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can specify the minimum amounts in each currency required to launch a PBaaS chain using the \"minpreconversion\" property, and the maximum amounts using the \"maxpreconversion\" property. Both properties are lists of strings representing the minimum and maximum amounts, respectively, and must be the same size as the \"currencies\" list.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the \"initialcontributions\" property used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"initialcontributions\" property specifies the initial contribution in each currency. It is a list of strings representing the initial contributions, and must be the same size as the \"currencies\" list.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I specify the initial supply of a PBaaS chain after conversion of contributions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can specify the initial supply of a PBaaS chain after conversion of contributions using the \"initialsupply\" property. It is a required property for fractional reserve currencies.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the \"prelaunchcarveout\" property?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"prelaunchcarveout\" property specifies the percentage of pre-converted amounts from each reserve currency that are carved out for identities. It is a value representing the percentage, and is optional.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I specify the pre-allocation of a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can specify the pre-allocation of a PBaaS chain using the \"preallocations\" property. It is a list of objects representing the identities and amounts from pre-allocation.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the \"gatewayconvertername\" property used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"gatewayconvertername\" property specifies the name of a co-launched gateway converter currency, if this is a PBaaS chain. It is a string representing the name of the gateway converter currency.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I specify the target time in seconds to average between blocks for a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can specify the target time in seconds to average between blocks for a PBaaS chain using the \"blocktime\" property. It is an integer representing the target time, and defaults to 60 seconds.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I specify the minimum period miners/stakers must wait to post new notarization to a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can specify the minimum period miners/stakers must wait to post new notarization to a PBaaS chain using the \"notarizationperiod\" property. It is an integer representing the minimum period, and defaults to 10 minutes at any blocktime.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the \"eras\" property used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"eras\" property specifies the data specific to each era, including the native initial block rewards, reward decay, halving period, and ending block of each era. It is an array of objects representing the eras.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, how do I specify the nodes that can be used to connect to a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can specify the nodes that can be used to connect to a PBaaS chain using the \"nodes\" property. It is a list of objects representing the nodes, including their network addresses and other information.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.",
