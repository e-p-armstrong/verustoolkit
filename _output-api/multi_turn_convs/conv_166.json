    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you may have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `submitacceptednotarization` command in Verus. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `submitacceptednotarization` command is used to finish an almost complete notarization transaction based on the notary chain and the current wallet or pubkey. It submits a transaction based on the earned notarization and notary evidence, and returns a transaction ID if successful. Do you have any more questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! What are the required arguments for the `submitacceptednotarization` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `submitacceptednotarization` command requires two arguments:\n\n1. `earnednotarization`: an object representing the notarization earned on another system, which is the basis for this notarization.\n2. `notaryevidence`: an object containing evidence and notary signatures validating the notarization.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if the `submitacceptednotarization` command is successful?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the `submitacceptednotarization` command is successful, it returns a transaction ID (txid) as a hexadecimal string.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `submitacceptednotarization` command with the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `submitacceptednotarization` command with the Verus CLI by running the following command:\n\n```\nverus submitacceptednotarization \"{earnednotarization}\" \"{notaryevidence}\"\n```\n\nReplace `{earnednotarization}` and `{notaryevidence}` with the actual values for your notarization and evidence.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about with the Verus JSON-RPC API? How can I use the `submitacceptednotarization` command with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `submitacceptednotarization` command with the Verus JSON-RPC API by sending a JSON request to the Verus RPC server. The request should have the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\",\n  \"id\": \"curltest\",\n  \"method\": \"submitacceptednotarization\",\n  \"params\": [\"{earnednotarization}\", \"{notaryevidence}\"]\n}\n```\n\nReplace `{earnednotarization}` and `{notaryevidence}` with the actual values for your notarization and evidence. You can send this request using a tool like `curl`.",
