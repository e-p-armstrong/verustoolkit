    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some of the commands in Verus. Can you tell me about the `getnetworkhashps` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getnetworkhashps` command is used to estimate the network solutions per second based on the last n blocks. However, please note that it's deprecated and left for backwards-compatibility, and it's recommended to use `getnetworksolps` instead. Do you have any specific questions about how to use `getnetworkhashps` or what it does?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually. How do I use the `getnetworkhashps` command to estimate the network speed at a certain block height?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo estimate the network speed at a certain block height using the `getnetworkhashps` command, you can pass in the block height as the second argument. For example: `verus getnetworkhashps 120 1000` would estimate the network speed at the time when block 1000 was found, based on the last 120 blocks.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the default number of blocks used by the `getnetworkhashps` command to estimate the network speed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default number of blocks used by the `getnetworkhashps` command to estimate the network speed is 120. However, you can override this by passing in a different number of blocks as the first argument. For example: `verus getnetworkhashps 240` would use the last 240 blocks to estimate the network speed.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen some examples where -1 is passed as the first argument to the `getnetworkhashps` command. What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPassing -1 as the first argument to the `getnetworkhashps` command specifies that the command should use blocks over the difficulty averaging window to estimate the network speed.",
