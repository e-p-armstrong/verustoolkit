    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some of the commands in Verus. Can you tell me what the purpose of the `listsinceblock` command is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listsinceblock` command is used to get all transactions in blocks since a specified block hash, or all transactions if the block hash is omitted. It returns a list of transactions with their details. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about the `listsinceblock` command?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that helps! What are the arguments that can be passed to the `listsinceblock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listsinceblock` command takes three optional arguments:\n\n1. \"blockhash\" (string, optional): The block hash to list transactions since.\n2. target-confirmations (numeric, optional): The confirmations required, which must be 1 or more.\n3. includeWatchonly (bool, optional, default=false): Whether to include transactions to watchonly addresses.\n\nThese arguments allow you to customize the output of the `listsinceblock` command to suit your needs. Do you have any more questions about using the `listsinceblock` command or its arguments?",
