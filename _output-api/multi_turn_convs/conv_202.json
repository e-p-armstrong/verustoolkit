    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was looking into the `addmergedblock` command, can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `addmergedblock` command is used to add a fully prepared block and its header to the current merge mining queue of the Verus daemon. Do you have any further questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What are the required arguments for the `addmergedblock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required arguments for the `addmergedblock` command are:\n\n1. \"hexdata\" (string, required): the hex-encoded, complete, unsolved block data to add.\n2. \"jsonparametersobject\" (object, required): an object containing parameters such as the chain name symbol, RPC host address, RPC port address, and credentials for login to RPC.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if adding a block would exceed the available merge mining slots?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default action taken by the `addmergedblock` command if adding a block would exceed the available merge mining slots is to replace the choice with the least ROI if the new block provides more. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nWhat are some possible results of the `addmergedblock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome possible results of the `addmergedblock` command are:\n\n1. \"deserialize-invalid\" - the block could not be deserialized and was rejected as invalid.\n2. \"blocksfull\" - the block did not exceed others in estimated ROI, and there was no room for an additional merge mined block.\n3. {\"nextblocktime\": n} - the block has an invalid time and must be remade with the time returned.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the `addmergedblock` command?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `addmergedblock` command with curl?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `addmergedblock` command with curl by sending a JSON-RPC request to the Verus daemon. The format of the request is:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"addmergedblock\", \"params\": [\"hexdata\" '{\"currencyid\" : \"hexstring\", \"rpchost\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"rpcport\" : portnum, \"estimatedroi\" : (verusreward/hashrate)}'] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
