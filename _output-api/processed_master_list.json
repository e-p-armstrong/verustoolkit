I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?", "User:: I've been playing around with the `updateidentity` command, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. What is the purpose of the `updateidentity` command in Verus?", "AI Assistant:: The `updateidentity` command is used to update the definition of an identity in Verus. It allows you to modify the properties of an existing identity. Do you have any further questions about this command?", "User:: That makes sense. What is the required argument for the `updateidentity` command?", "AI Assistant:: The required argument for the `updateidentity` command is `\"jsonidentity\"`, which is a JSON object that contains the new definition of the identity. Do you have any questions about how to format this JSON object?", "User:: No, I think I understand that part. What is the default behavior of the `updateidentity` command if the `returntx` argument is not specified?", "AI Assistant:: If the `returntx` argument is not specified, the default behavior of the `updateidentity` command is to send the transaction and return the transaction ID (txid) as a hex string. Does that make sense?", "User:: Yeah, got it. What is the purpose of the `tokenupdate` argument in the `updateidentity` command?", "AI Assistant:: The `tokenupdate` argument in the `updateidentity` command is used to specify whether the tokenized ID control token should be used to update the identity. If set to `true`, it enables changing the revocation or recovery IDs, even if the wallet holding the token does not control either. Do you have any questions about how to use this argument?", "User:: No, I think I understand. How can I specify a non-standard fee amount for the `updateidentity` transaction?", "AI Assistant:: You can specify a non-standard fee amount for the `updateidentity` transaction by using the `feeoffer` argument and providing the desired fee value. Does that make sense?", "User:: Yeah, got it. What is the purpose of the `sourceoffunds` argument in the `updateidentity` command?", "AI Assistant:: The `sourceoffunds` argument in the `updateidentity` command is used to specify a transparent or private address to source all funds for fees, which helps preserve the privacy of the identity. Does that make sense?", "User:: Yeah, I think so. How can I use the `updateidentity` command via the Verus CLI and via the Verus RPC API?", "AI Assistant:: You can use the `updateidentity` command via the Verus CLI by running a command like `verus updateidentity '{\"name\" : \"myname\"}'`.

I was wondering, what are the two possible return formats of the `getrawtransaction` command?", "AI Assistant:: The `getrawtransaction` command can return data in two formats:\n\n1.
