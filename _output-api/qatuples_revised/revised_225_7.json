    "What is the purpose of the \"notarizationprotocol\" field in a PBaaS chain or currency definition?",
    "The \"notarizationprotocol\" field specifies the notarization protocol used by the PBaaS chain or currency. It can be one of three values:\n1. PROOF_PBAASMMR (1): Verus MMR proof, no notaries required.\n2. PROOF_CHAINID (2): Chain ID is sole notary for proof, no evidence required.\n3. PROOF_ETHNOTARIZATION (3): Ethereum notarization & PATRICIA TRIE proof.",
