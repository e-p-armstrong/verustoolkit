    "What is the purpose of the `returntx` argument in the `setidentitytimelock` command?",
    "The `returntx` argument determines whether the transaction is sent or returned as a signed transaction. If `returntx` is set to `true`, the transaction is signed by the wallet and returned, but it will not be submitted to the network. If `returntx` is set to `false` (default), the transaction is sent to the network.",
    "setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\":absoluteblockheight || \"setunlockdelay\":numberofblocksdelayafterunlock}' (returntx) (feeoffer) (sourceoffunds)Enables timelocking and unlocking of funds access for an on-chain VerusID. This does not affect the lock status of VerusIDs on other chains, including VerusIDs with the same identity as this one, which has been exported to another chain.Use \"setunlockdelay\" to set a time unlock delay on an identity, which means that once the identity has been unlocked, numberofblocksdelayafterunlock must then pass before the identity will be able to spend funds on this blockchain. Services which support VerusID authentication and recognize this setting may also choose to prevent funds transfers when an ID is locked.Use \"unlockatblock\" to either unlock, by passing the current block, which will still require waiting for the specified unlock delay, or to set a future unlock height that immediately begins counting down. Unlike an unlock delay, which only starts counting down when the ID is unlocked, an \"unlockatblock\" time lock is absolute and will automatically unlock when the specified block passes.Arguments - either \"unlockatblock\" or \"setunlockdelay\" must be specified and not both {  \"unlockatblock\"        (number, optional) unlock at an absolute block height, countdown starts when mined into a block  \"setunlockdelay\"        (number, optional) delay this many blocks after unlock request to unlock, can only be                            circumvented by revoke/recover }    \"returntx\"            (bool,  optional) defaults to false and transaction is sent, if true, transaction is signed by this wallet and returned    \"feeoffer\"            (value, optional) non-standard fee amount to pay for the transaction    \"sourceoffunds\"          (string, optional) transparent or private address to source all funds for fees to preserve privacy of the identityResult:  Hex string of either the txid if returnhex is false or the hex serialized transaction if returntx is true.  If returntx is true, the transaction will not have been submitted and must be sent with \"sendrawtransaction\"  after any necessary signatures are applied in the case of multisig.",
