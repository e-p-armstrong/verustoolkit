    "The possible results of the `submitblock` command are:\n\n1. \"duplicate\" - node already has a valid copy of the block\n2. \"duplicate-invalid\" - node already has the block, but it is invalid\n3. \"duplicate-inconclusive\" - node already has the block, but has not validated it\n4. \"inconclusive\" - node has not validated the block, it may not be on the node's current best chain\n5. \"rejected\" - block was rejected as invalid",
