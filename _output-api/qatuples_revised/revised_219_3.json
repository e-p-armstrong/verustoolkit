    "What is the effect of the `fee delta` argument on the transaction?",
    "The `fee delta` argument does not actually change the fee paid by the transaction. Instead, it modifies the fee value that the transaction selection algorithm considers when deciding which transactions to include in a block. This allows you to simulate the effect of a higher or lower fee without actually changing the transaction.",
    "prioritisetransaction <txid> <priority delta> <fee delta> Accepts the transaction into mined blocks at a higher (or lower) priority Arguments: 1. \"txid\"    (string, required) The transaction id. 2. priority delta (numeric, required) The priority to add or subtract.          The transaction selection algorithm considers the tx as it would have a higher priority.          (priority of a transaction is calculated: coinage * value_in_satoshis / txsize) 3. fee delta   (numeric, required) The fee value (in satoshis) to add (or subtract, if negative).          The fee is not actually paid, only the algorithm for selecting transactions into a block          considers the transaction as it would have paid a higher (or lower) fee. Result true       (boolean) Returns true Examples: > verus prioritisetransaction \"txid\" 0.0 10000 > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"prioritisetransaction\", \"params\": [\"txid\", 0.0, 10000] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
