    "What are the arguments required for the `z_importkey` command?",
    "The `z_importkey` command requires at least one argument, which is the \"zkey\" string. This is the private key being imported into the wallet. There are also two optional arguments: \"rescan\" and \"startHeight\". \"rescan\" determines whether to rescan the wallet for transactions, and \"startHeight\" specifies the block height to start the rescan from.",
    "z_importkey \"zkey\" ( rescan startHeight ) Adds a zkey (as returned by z_exportkey) to your wallet. Arguments: 1. \"zkey\"       (string, required) The zkey (see z_exportkey) 2. rescan        (string, optional, default=\"whenkeyisnew\") Rescan the wallet for transactions - can be \"yes\", \"no\" or \"whenkeyisnew\" 3. startHeight     (numeric, optional, default=0) Block height to start rescan from Note: This call can take minutes to complete if rescan is true. Examples: Export a zkey > verus z_exportkey \"myaddress\" Import the zkey with rescan > verus z_importkey \"mykey\" Import the zkey with partial rescan > verus z_importkey \"mykey\" whenkeyisnew 30000 Re-import the zkey with longer partial rescan > verus z_importkey \"mykey\" yes 20000 As a JSON-RPC call > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_importkey\", \"params\": [\"mykey\", \"no\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
