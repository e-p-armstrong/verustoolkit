    "To retrieve the content of an identity, including deleted items, you can use the `getidentitycontent` command with the `keepdeleted` argument set to `true`. For example:\n\n```\nverus getidentitycontent \"name@\" true\n```\n\nThis will return the content associated with the identity \"name@\", including any deleted items.",
