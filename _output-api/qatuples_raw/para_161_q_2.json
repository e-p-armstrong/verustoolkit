    "The default action taken by the `addmergedblock` command if adding a block would exceed the available merge mining slots is to replace the choice with the least ROI if the new block provides more.",
    "addmergedblock \"hexdata\" ( \"jsonparametersobject\" ) Adds a fully prepared block and its header to the current merge mining queue of this daemon. Parameters determine the action to take if adding this block would exceed the available merge mining slots. Default action to take if adding would exceed available space is to replace the choice with the least ROI if this block provides more. Arguments 1. \"hexdata\"           (string, required) the hex-encoded, complete, unsolved block data to add. nTime, and nSolution are replaced. 2. \"name\"            (string, required) chain name symbol 3. \"rpchost\"           (string, required) host address for RPC connection 4. \"rpcport\"           (int,  required) port address for RPC connection 5. \"userpass\"          (string, required) credentials for login to RPC Result: \"deserialize-invalid\" - block could not be deserialized and was rejected as invalid \"blocksfull\"     - block did not exceed others in estimated ROI, and there was no room for an additional merge mined block {\"nextblocktime\": n} - block has invalid time and must be remade with time returned Examples: > verus addmergedblock \"hexdata\" '{\"currencyid\" : \"hexstring\", \"rpchost\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"rpcport\" : portnum}' > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"addmergedblock\", \"params\": [\"hexdata\" '{\"currencyid\" : \"hexstring\", \"rpchost\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"rpcport\" : portnum, \"estimatedroi\" : (verusreward/hashrate)}'] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
