    "The two optional arguments that can be passed to the `z_gettotalbalance` command are:\n\n1. `minconf`: a numeric value that specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for a transaction to be included in the balance calculation. The default value is 1.\n2. `includeWatchonly`: a boolean value that indicates whether to include the balance in watch-only addresses in the calculation. The default value is false.",
    "z_gettotalbalance ( minconf includeWatchonly ) Return the total value of funds stored in the node's wallet. CAUTION: If the wallet contains any addresses for which it only has incoming viewing keys, the returned private balance may be larger than the actual balance, because spends cannot be detected with incoming viewing keys. Arguments: 1. minconf     (numeric, optional, default=1) Only include private and transparent transactions confirmed at least this many times. 2. includeWatchonly (bool, optional, default=false) Also include balance in watchonly addresses (see 'importaddress' and 'z_importviewingkey') Result: {  \"transparent\": xxxxx,   (numeric) the total balance of transparent funds  \"private\": xxxxx,     (numeric) the total balance of shielded funds (in both Sprout and Sapling addresses)  \"total\": xxxxx,      (numeric) the total balance of both transparent and shielded funds } Examples: The total amount in the wallet > verus z_gettotalbalance The total amount in the wallet at least 5 blocks confirmed > verus z_gettotalbalance 5 As a json rpc call > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_gettotalbalance\", \"params\": [5] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
