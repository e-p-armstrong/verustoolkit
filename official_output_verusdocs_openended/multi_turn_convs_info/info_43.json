            "How can I export a currency from Verus to Ethereum as an ERC-20 using the Verus-Ethereum Bridge, and what are the key components of the command to do so?",
            "Exporting a currency from Verus to Ethereum as an ERC-20 is a straightforward process using the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. This bridge enables seamless transfer of funds between Verus and Ethereum, allowing you to utilize your currency in the larger Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nTo export a currency, you'll need to use the `sendcurrency` command with specific parameters. Here's a breakdown of the command:\n\n```json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"myVerusID@\" '[{\n  \"address\":\"0x85a7dE2278E52327471e174AeeB280cdFdC6A68a\", \n  \"currency\":\"myCurrency\", \n  \"amount\":0, \n  \"exportto\":\"veth\", \n  \"exportcurrency\":true, \n  \"feecurrency\":\"veth\"\n}]'\n```\n\nLet's examine the key components of this command:\n\n* `myVerusID@` is the from- and change-address, which can be a VerusID, R-address, or i-address. The fee for the export will be deducted from this address, and any excess fees will be refunded to this address.\n* `address` is an Ethereum address, which can be any valid ETH address. Note that the specific address used here is not crucial.\n* `currency` is the name of the currency you wish to export as an ERC-20, such as `MyCurrency` or `MyCurrency.vETH`.\n* `amount` is set to 0, as you're not sending a specific amount of the currency, but rather exporting the currency itself as an ERC-20.\n* `exportto` specifies the target chain, which in this case is `veth` (Verus-Ethereum).\n* `exportcurrency` is a boolean flag indicating that you want to export the currency as an ERC-20.\n* `feecurrency` specifies the currency to be used for paying the fees, which in this case is also `veth`.\n\nAfter executing this command, you'll need to wait for the bridge to be notarized to the block height where you exported the currency. Once notarized, you can select your exported ERC-20 currency from the token dropdown on the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website (either mainnet or Goerli testnet, depending on your setup).\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully export a currency from Verus to Ethereum as an ERC-20, opening up new possibilities for using your currency in the Ethereum ecosystem.",
            "# Export currency to Ethereum (as ERC-20)\n\nAny currency on Verus can be exported to Ethereum as an ERC-20. The currency can then be used in the complete Ethereum ecosystem, and on the Verus network. Sending to and from Verus and Ethereum couldn't be easier.

We must have enough funds to pay for the export.\n\nThe command to export a currency to Ethereum as an ERC-20:\n\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"myVerusID@\" '[{\n  \"address\":\"0x85a7dE2278E52327471e174AeeB280cdFdC6A68a\", \n  \"currency\":\"myCurrency\", \n  \"amount\":0, \n  \"exportto\":\"veth\", \n  \"exportcurrency\":true, \n  \"feecurrency\":\"veth\"\n}]'\n```\n\nLet's break the command down with what you can change.\n\n**``myVerusID@``** is the from- and change-address. Can be a VerusID, R-address or i-address. The fee to pay for the export comes from here, and if you paid too much fees the rest will be returned here.\n\n**``address``** You can fill in any ETH-address here, it is actually not important what is here.\n\n**``currency``** is the name of the currency you wish to export as an ERC-20. E.g. `MyCurrency`, `MyCurrency.vETH`.\n\n### Wait for notarization\n\nAfter the bridge has been notarized to the blockheight where you have exported the currency, you can choose it from the token dropdown on the [Bridge website mainnet](https://eth.verusbridge.io) or [Bridge website Goerli testnet](https://ethbridge.verustest.net/)",
