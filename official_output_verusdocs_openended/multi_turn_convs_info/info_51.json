            "The Verus Data eXchange Format (VDXF) is a standardized format for representing and exchanging data between different systems and applications, whether they are centralized or decentralized. VDXF provides a way to define globally unique data types, which can consist of structured or unstructured data, and associate them with content or keys that can be used to retrieve the data from various storage locations.\n\nA VDXF object is a structured representation of data that is serialized into a byte format, making it easy to transmit or store. This format enables application developers to define data types and publish references to them, which can be used by other applications to understand and work with the data, even if they don't know how to process the entire dataset.\n\nVDXF type keys are globally unique identifiers that are defined as human-readable names, along with a specification for converting these names into collision-free 20-byte IDs. These IDs can be used as type keys associated with content or location values in various forms of data records.\n\nThe VDXF format is designed to be interoperable, meaning that applications can use the data in whole or in part, even if they don't understand the entire dataset. This is achieved by providing a way to define and exchange data types, along with the associated content or keys, which can be used to retrieve and process the data.\n\nIn summary, VDXF provides a standardized way to represent and exchange data between different systems and applications, enabling interoperability and facilitating the development of decentralized applications.",
            "# Verus Data eXchange Format (VDXF)The Verus Data Exchange Format provides a fully interoperable system for defining data types that may consist of structured or or unstructured data and associated content or keys that may be used to retrieve such data from centralized or decentralized storage for use in and across centralized or decentralized applications.The Verus Data eXchange Format (VDXF) object is a structured data representation of the Verus Data eXchange Format, designed to facilitate the exchange of information across different systems and programming languages. It encapsulates data in a serialized byte format, making it interoperable and easy to transmit or store. This document outlines the structure and functionality of a VDXF object, focusing on its serialized form rather than the methods used to manipulate it in any specific programming language.## OverviewThe Verus Data Exchange Format enables application developers to define globally unique data types and publish references to the same, which may refer to structured or unstructured data that can be located unambiguously via an URL, which implicitly provides both location and decoding information, enabling applications to use such data, in whole or in part, if they know how, or even ignore parts of the data, while remaining compatible with those parts they understand. VDXF typee keys are globally unique identifiers, which are defined as human readable names along with a specification of how to define and convert unlimited length, human readable type names into collison-free 20 byte IDs, which can be used as type keys associated with content or location values in various forms of data records. These data records, which may have application specific structures or no structure at all, besides length form the basis of an interoperable data exchange format across decentralized applications.",
