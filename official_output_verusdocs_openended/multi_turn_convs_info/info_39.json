            "Verus Proof of Power (VerusPoP) is a hybrid consensus algorithm that combines the benefits of both Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate each block on the Verus blockchain. This innovative consensus mechanism ensures that 50% of all blocks are validated by miners (using PoW) and the other 50% are validated by stakers (using PoS).\n\nThe VerusPoP algorithm uses a statistical function to combine the two forms of proof, making it a unique and secure way to validate transactions on the blockchain. To successfully attack the Verus blockchain, an attacker would need to control more than 50% of the validation power, which is known as \"Chain Power\". This would require a combined value of over 50% of both the chain's hashpower and its coin supply, making it extremely difficult to launch a 51% attack.\n\nOne of the key benefits of VerusPoP is its decentralized nature, which incentivizes holders to keep nodes online to support the network. Even if there is a change in network hashrate, the PoW/PoS ratio remains the same, ensuring that the network remains decentralized and secure.\n\nVerusPoP also utilizes a custom hash function called VerusHash 2.2, which is designed to be CPU-friendly and allows CPUs and GPUs to compete on an economically comparable level. This makes it the fastest known cryptocurrency hash algorithm available to modern CPUs.\n\nOverall, VerusPoP provides a secure, decentralized, and efficient consensus mechanism for the Verus blockchain, making it an attractive option for users and developers alike.",
            "# Verus Proof of Power\nVerusPoP is a 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.\n[More information on the Verus miner and staker ecosystem](/economy/).## Hybrid Consensus\nVerus Proof of Power, or VerusPoP, is a hybrid consensus algorithm which uses a statistical function that combines Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate each block by either PoW or PoS, while averaging to a target percentage of blocks being validated by each form of proof.In short, it a unique consensus mechanism with 50% of all blocks validated by miners, and the other 50% by stakers.## Attack Resistant\nTo successfully attack the Verus blockchain, more than 50% of the validation power is needed, called ``Chain Power``. A 51% attack would require a combined value of over 50% of both the chain\u2019s hashpower and its coin supply. [For technical information on VerusPoP read the whitepaper](https://verus.io/docs/VerusPoP.pdf).VerusPoP provides a decentralizing effect on the network, incentivizing holders to keep nodes online to support the network. Even if a change in network hashrate happens, the PoW/PoS ratio stays the same: 50/50%.## VerusHash 2.2\n[From the VerusPoP whitepaper](https://verus.io/docs/VerusPoP.pdf):\"VerusHash is specifically developed to deliver a competitive advantage for CPUs with GPUs. It is an exceedingly CPU-friendly long input hash function that uses the quantum-secure, short input Haraka512 V2 as its core compression algorithm. The result is the fastest known cryptocurrency hash algorithm available to modern CPUs and the only hash algorithm which enables today\u2019s CPUs and GPUs to compete on an economically comparable level.",
