            "What are the key benefits and characteristics of launching currencies on Verus, a Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) protocol, and how do basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools) work on Verus?",
            "Launching currencies on Verus, a Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) protocol, offers several benefits over other EVM-like protocols. These benefits include faster, cheaper, and more secure launches, with no coding involved. There are two types of currencies that can be launched on Verus: basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools) and simple token currencies. Both types can be issued in a decentralized or centralized manner, with minting and burning capabilities.\n\nBasket currencies, also known as liquidity pools, are a type of currency that can be launched on Verus. They function similarly to automated market makers (AMMs) and have reserves, which can be any currency or token on the Verus network. These reserves can also be bridged from other networks. Basket currencies have a dynamic supply, which is dependent on the amount of conversions into or out of the basket currency. The supply is minted when users convert into the basket currency and burned when users convert out of it.\n\nA basket currency can have between 1 and 10 currencies in its reserves, and its supply is directly linked to the reserve ratio, also known as the weight. The reserve ratio determines the volatility of the basket currency when users convert into or out of it. A higher reserve ratio means that the basket currency is more stable, while a lower reserve ratio makes it more volatile. The value of the basket currency is directly tied to the value of its reserves and the reserve ratio.\n\nIn addition to basket currencies, Verus also allows for the creation of subIDs, which are powerful objects that are similar to VerusIDs but cannot launch blockchains or currencies. SubIDs can be created from any currency launched on Verus, offering a range of possibilities for decentralized applications and use cases.",
            "# Introduction\nLaunching currencies on Verus, and any other PBaaS-chain (Public Blockchains as a Service), is better, faster, cheaper and more secure than any EVM-like protocol out there. There is no coding involved.There are two types of currencies that can be launched with the Verus Protocol. Basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools) and simple token currencies. Both can be issued decentralized, or centralized with minting and burning capabilities.When a currency is launched, subIDs can be created from it. SubIDs are powerful objects on Verus (and other PBaaS-blockchains). They are exactly the same as [VerusIDs](/verusid/), yet can not launch blockchains or currencies.## Basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools)\n![image-basket-currencies](/images/currencies-reserves.png)Basket currencies function like automated market makers (AMMs), they have reserves. A reserve can be any currency or token on the Verus network (also bridged). Have a look at the simplified image. If anyone has currency X or Y, they can convert to the basket currency, or convert from reserve to reserve. If anyone has the basket currency, they can go to currency X or Y. A basket currency can have 1 and up to 10 currencies in its reserves.The basket currency supply is dynamic, depending on how much is converted to the basket currency (supply minted), or back to its reserve(s) (supply burned).A basket currency can be 100% backed by its reserves, 5%, or anything in between. This is called the reserve ratio, or the weight. The lower the reserve ratio, the more volatile the currency is when people are converting into or out of the basket currency. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to what is in the reserves and what the reserve ratio is.",
