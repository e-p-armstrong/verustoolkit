            "How do I register a.vETH subID to launch a currency with a 1-to-1 mapping of an ERC-20, and what are the contract addresses involved in this process?",
            "To register a.vETH subID and launch a currency with a 1-to-1 mapping of an ERC-20, you need to follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Register a VerusID/subID**\nFirst, you need to register a VerusID/subID. This can be done by following the instructions in the VerusID creation guide.\n\n**Step 2: Pay the registration fee**\nThe cost of registering a.vETH subID is 0.01 vETH worth of Bridge.vETH. This fee needs to be paid in order to complete the registration process.\n\n**Contract Addresses**\nThere are three important contract addresses involved in this process:\n\n1. **Verus-Ethereum Bridge smart contract mainnet**: This is the contract address for the Verus-Ethereum Bridge smart contract on the mainnet. The address is 0x71518580f36FeCEFfE0721F06bA4703218cD7F63.\n2. **VRSC token address**: This is the contract address for the VRSC token. The address is 0xBc2738BA63882891094C99e59a02141Ca1a1C36a.\n3. **Bridge.vETH token address**: This is the contract address for the Bridge.vETH token. The address is 0xE6052Dcc60573561ECef2D9A4C0FEA6d3aC5B9A2.\n\nThese contract addresses are essential for the registration process and for interacting with the Verus-Ethereum Bridge.",
