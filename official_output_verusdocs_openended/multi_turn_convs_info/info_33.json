            "What are the core principles and characteristics of Verus, and how did it achieve a fair launch?",
            "Verus is a decentralized public blockchain that operates on a set of core principles, which are designed to promote openness, accessibility, and fairness. These principles include:\n\n* **Decentralization**: Verus is a community-driven project, which means that anyone can participate and contribute, regardless of their background or location.\n* **Openness**: Verus is an open system, allowing anyone to start mining and staking the Verus Protocol without any hurdles or restrictions.\n* **Borderlessness**: Verus is a global platform, accessible to anyone with an internet connection.\n* **Public**: Verus is a public blockchain, meaning that all transactions and data are transparent and publicly available.\n* **Neutrality**: Verus is a neutral platform, free from commercial interests and rent-seeking behavior.\n* **Censorship resistance**: Verus is designed to be resistant to censorship, ensuring that all participants have a voice and can operate freely.\n\nVerus achieved a fair launch by avoiding common practices that can create unequal opportunities or unfair advantages. Specifically:\n\n* **No ICO**: Verus did not hold an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), which means that there was no pre-sale of tokens to a select group of investors.\n* **No founder or developer fees/tax**: Verus does not charge any fees or taxes to its founders or developers, ensuring that all participants have equal access to the platform.\n* **No premine**: Verus did not pre-mine any tokens, which means that all coins were mined fairly and transparently by the community.\n* **No commercial interests**: Verus is not driven by commercial interests, ensuring that the platform is focused on serving the community rather than generating profits.\n* **No rent-seeking behavior**: Verus is designed to prevent rent-seeking behavior, which means that participants are rewarded based on their contributions to the network rather than their ability to accumulate wealth.\n\nThe launch of the Verus blockchain was announced publicly on the Bitcointalk.org forum, giving everyone equal opportunity to participate and start mining and staking the Verus Protocol. This fair launch approach has contributed to Verus being one of the most decentralized networks worldwide.",
            "## Decentralized & community-built\nVerus is a decentralized public blockchain, a community driven project in the true spirit of Bitcoin. Anyone can participate and contribute, no matter who you are or where you come from. Verus is:\n* **Open**\n* **Borderless**\n* **Public**\n* **Neutral**\n* **Censorship resistant**\n\nAnyone can start mining and staking the Verus Protocol. Mobile phones and ARMs (e.g. Orange Pi 5) are the most energy efficient devices to mine Verus (and 22 other PBaaS-chains) with. To stake there are no minimum requirements or locking of funds.\n\nThere is no company behind Verus, it is community-built. All protocol fees go to the block producers of the network (the miners and stakers).\n\nThese characteristics that anyone can participate in the Verus Protocol makes it one of the most decentralized networks worldwide.\n\n## Fair launch\nVerus had a fair launch, meaning that everyone had, and still has equal opportunity to collect its currency through mining and staking. For Verus this means:\n* **No ICO has been held**\n* **No founder or developer fees/tax**\n* **No premine**\n* **No commercial interests**\n* **No rent-seeking behavior**\n\nThe launch of the Verus blockchain was announced on the Bitcointalk.org forum [See post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4070404.0) 15 minutes before the first block could be mined.\n\n::: tip Rich List\n[Take a look at the richlist to see coin distribution.](https://dexstats.info/richlist.php?asset=VRSC) \n:::",
