            "What are the main features and security mechanisms of the Verus-Ethereum Bridge, and how does it facilitate cross-chain transactions?",
            "The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is a decentralized bridge that enables seamless transactions between the Verus and Ethereum networks. The bridge offers several key features that make it a powerful tool for users:\n\n**Conversions:** The bridge allows for conversions between VRSC, ETH, DAI, and MKR in any direction, on both the Verus and Ethereum networks. Additionally, it enables conversions to and from the Bridge.vETH currency.\n\n**Launch Mapped Currencies:** Users can launch currencies on Verus that are 1:1 mapped to any ERC-20 token.\n\n**Export Currencies as ERC-20:** Any launched currency on Verus can be exported as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum.\n\n**Cross-Chain Sends:** The bridge enables sending of tokens, basket currencies, and mapped currencies across the bridge.\n\n**Export Tokenized ID Control:** Users can export a tokenized VerusID to Ethereum as an ERC-721 token.\n\n**Map VerusID to Ethereum NFT:** It is possible to launch a tokenized ID with a mapping of an Ethereum ERC-721 or ERC-1155 token.\n\nThe Bridge.vETH currency is a 100% backed currency that makes bridging assets simple, with fees converted seamlessly.\n\nThe Verus-Ethereum Bridge is secure due to its decentralized architecture, which ensures that assets are never in anyone's custody. The bridge operates through the cooperation of block producers, community notary witnesses, the Bridgekeeper software, and an Ethereum smart contract. At each step of cross-chain transactions, assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent hacks. This ensures that transactions are secure, trustless, and censorship-resistant.",
            "| What       |     Details      |\n| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------- |\n| **Conversions**| Convert VRSC, ETH (vETH), DAI (DAI.vETH) & MKR (MKR.vETH) with each other into any direction (on/to Verus & Ethereum), or to and from the Bridge.vETH currency.|\n| **Launch mapped currencies**| Launch currencies on Verus that are 1:1 mapped to any ERC-20. [Learn how](/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html)|\n| **Export currencies as ERC-20**| Export any launched currency (simple tokens, basket currencies) on Verus as an ERC-20. [Learn how](/currencies/export-to-eth.html)|\n| **Cross-chain sends**| Send any tokens, basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools), mapped currencies etc. that are exported to Ethereum across the bridge.|\n| **Export tokenized ID control**| Export a tokenized VerusID to Ethereum as ERC-721.|\n| **Map VerusID to Ethereum NFT**| Launch a tokenized ID with a mapping of an Ethereum ERC-721 or ERC-1155.|Then there is the bridge currency Bridge.vETH, a 100% backed currency with 4 currencies in its reserves (VRSC, ETH, DAI, MKR). The Bridge.vETH currency function is to make the bridging of assets simple. From wherever you send it converts the fees that you need seamlessly. [More on Bridge.vETH below.](/eth-bridge/#bridge-veth-currency)## What makes the Verus-Ethereum Bridge secure\nThe Verus-Ethereum Bridge is different because the assets are never in anyone\u2019s custody. This is done through the seamless cooperation between the block producers (worldwide miners and stakers), community notary witnesses, [the Bridgekeeper software](https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verusbridgekeeper) and the [Ethereum smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x71518580f36FeCEFfE0721F06bA4703218cD7F63). At each step during cross-chain transactions the assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent hacks.",
