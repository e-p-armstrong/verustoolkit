            "What are the different options and parameters available when defining a currency in Verus, and how do they affect the behavior and characteristics of the currency?",
            "When defining a currency in Verus, there are several options and parameters that can be specified to customize the behavior and characteristics of the currency. These options and parameters can be combined in various ways to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n**Options:**\nThe options available when defining a currency in Verus include:\n\n* Option 1: The currency has reserves and can be converted to and from the reserves. This is a \"Basket currency\" that can be launched centralized or decentralized.\n* Option 2: Only the controlling VerusID (the namespace of the currency, the rootID) can create subIDs.\n* Option 8: Referrals and discounts are enabled for subID creation.\n* Option 16: Referrals are required for subID creation.\n* Option 32: The currency is a simple token currency without any reserves. This option is also used for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens.\n* Option 2048: A single satoshi (0.00000001) NFT token is created and has tokenized control of the root VerusID.\n\nThese options can be combined in various ways to achieve the desired outcome. For example, `\"options\":33` launches a basket currency with reserves, while `\"options\":2080` launches a single satoshi token that has control of the root VerusID.\n\n**Parameters:**\nIn addition to options, there are also parameters that can be specified when defining a currency in Verus. One of the most important parameters is the `\"proofprotocol\"` parameter, which defines whether the currency is centralized or decentralized. This parameter can take on values of 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe `\"proofprotocol\"` parameter is just one example of the many parameters that can be specified when defining a currency in Verus. The specific parameters available and their effects on the currency will depend on the options chosen and the desired behavior of the currency.\n\nOverall, the options and parameters available in Verus provide a high degree of flexibility and customization when defining a currency, allowing users to create currencies that meet their specific needs and requirements.",
            "| Options # | Details |\n| -: |:-----|\n| 1 | The currency has reserves, and can be converted to and from the reserves (option 32 needs to be added). Can have one currency as its reserves, or multiple with up to 10 currencies. This is a \u201cBasket currency\u201d \u2014 a currency with a basket of reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized. |\n| 2 | Only the controlling VerusID (the namespace of the currency, the rootID) can create subIDs. |\n| 8 | Referrals and discounts are enabled for subID creation. |\n| 16 | Referrals are required for subID creation. |\n| 32 | The currency is a simple token currency without any reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized. This option is also used for [Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens](/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth). |\n| 2048 | A single satoshi (0.00000001) NFT token is created & has tokenized control of the root VerusID. Which means you can send the single satoshi token to other addresses and then they have control of the root VerusID. |Let\u2019s give some examples of combined options:\n- ``\"options\":33`` \u2014 this launches a basket currency. It is options 1 + 32 combined.\n- ``\"options\":2080`` \u2014 this launches a single satoshi token that has control of the root VerusID. It is options 32 + 2048 combined.\n- ``\"options\":35`` \u2014 this launches a basket currency, and only the rootID can create subIDs. It is options 1 + 2 + 32 combined.## Defining parameters\nNext up are the parameters. Choose the parameters wisely to launch a currency that suits any need. Not all parameters are needed or combinable. There are many to go through, so let\u2019s start.### **\"proofprotocol\"**\nThis parameter defines, among others, if the currency is centralized or decentralized. You can choose 1,2 or 3.",
