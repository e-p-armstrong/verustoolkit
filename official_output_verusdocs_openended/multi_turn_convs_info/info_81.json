            "Can you explain the block reward and coin emission schedule of Verus, as well as the fees associated with different activities on the platform?",
            "In Verus, the block reward and coin emission schedule are designed to incentivize miners and stakers to secure the network and validate transactions. The schedule is divided into several phases, each with a decreasing block reward. The block reward starts at 384 VRSC and halves approximately every 6 months, with the last phase having a block reward of 0.00292968 VRSC.\n\nThe total maximum circulating supply of all coins is capped at 83,540,184 VRSC. In addition to the block reward, Verus also generates fees from various activities on the platform, such as:\n\n* VerusID registration: 20-100 VRSC\n* PBaaS-chain launch: 10,000 VRSC (with half going to the miners and stakers of the newly launched PBaaS-chain)\n* Currency/Token launch: 200 VRSC\n* Conversion fee: 0.025% or 0.05%\n* Transaction fee: 0.0001 VRSC\n\nThese fees are earned by miners and stakers and are an additional incentive for them to participate in the network. The fees are also used to compensate for the resources required to process transactions and maintain the network.\n\nIt's worth noting that the block rewards of 384 and 192 VRSC were timelocked and then unlocked at random block heights, with the last of those rewards being unlocked at block height 1,181,520.",
