    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a new currency on the Verus network, similar to USDC. Can you walk me through the steps involved in defining and launching a new currency, and how I can export it to Ethereum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCreating a new currency on the Verus network is a straightforward process. Here are the steps you need to follow:\n\nTo define and launch a new currency on the Verus network, you need to follow these steps:\n\n**Defining the Currency**\nFirst, you need to define the currency using the `definecurrency` command. This command takes a JSON object as an argument, which specifies the properties of the currency. For example, to define a USDC-like currency called \"MyUSDC\", you would use the following command:\n\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"MyUSDC\", \n  \"options\":32, \n  \"systemid\":\"veth\", \n  \"parent\":\"vrsctest\", \n  \"launchsystemid\":\"vrsctest\", \n  \"nativecurrencyid\":{\n    \"type\":9, \n    \"address\":\"0x98339D8C260052B7ad81c28c16C0b98420f2B46a\"\n  }, \n  \"initialsupply\":0, \n  \"proofprotocol\":3\n}'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new currency called \"MyUSDC\" with the specified properties.\n\n**Launching the Currency**\nAfter defining the currency, you need to launch it on the network. To do this, you need to take the HEX returned by the `definecurrency` command and use it with the `sendrawtransaction` command. For example:\n\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction \"HEX\"\n```\n\nThis command launches the currency on the network.\n\n**Waiting for Confirmation**\nAfter launching the currency, you need to wait for a few blocks to be confirmed on the network. This allows the currency to be fully available on the network.\n\n**Exporting to Ethereum (Optional)**\nFinally, if you want to make the currency available on Ethereum as well, you need to export it. This involves additional steps, which are explained in more detail in a separate guide.\n\nBy following these steps, you can define and launch a new currency on the Verus network, and optionally export it to Ethereum.\n\nDo you have any questions about these steps, or would you like more information on exporting your new currency to Ethereum?",

We use this HEX to launch the currency on the network. Use the command below to launch the currency:\n\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction \"HEX\"\n```\n\nNow we have to wait a few blocks for the currency to be available on the network.\n\n### Export to Ethereum\nThe last step is to export the currency to Ethereum so we can see it there too.
