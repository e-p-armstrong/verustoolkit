Select \"Profile Settings\" (default) and click on \"Custom native mode launch options\". Select \"Verus\".\n\n**Step 3: Add launch options**\nIn the launch options field, add the following two lines:\n\n1. `minetolocalwallet=0`\n2. `pubkey=xxx` (replace \"xxx\" with the pubkey from your hot wallet device)\n\nClick \"Add launch option\" after each line, and then click \"Save Changes\". **Don't forget to save your changes!**\n\n**Step 4: Restart Verus Desktop**\nClose Verus Desktop and reopen it.

            "# Divert staking rewards to different wallet\n![image-divert](/images/divert-stakes.png)\nIf you are staking with funds on a VerusID, and that VerusID is locked with Vault, yet you want to spend your won stakes, this might be for you. Let's explain how you can divert your won stakes to a different wallet with Verus Desktop.\n\nWe have two devices with two different wallets:\n- Your staking device\n- Your hot wallet device\n\n### Hot wallet\nThe hot wallet is the device you want your stakes to arrive on. On the hot wallet we need to lookup the ``pubkey`` for the address you want your won stakes to arrive.\n\nGo to the ``Wallet-tab``, click ``receive`` under Transparent Balance. Then click the three-dots next to the address you want to use. Click ``Copy public key`` as seen in the image below. Paste and save this somewhere, we will need it later.\n\n![image-pubkey](/images/copy-pubkey.png)\n\n### Staking device\nThis device is staking happily, and your funds are secured with the Vault ([read here how to set up](/guides/setup-vault/)). Let's make sure your won stakes are sent to your hot wallet device.\n\nGo to ``settings`` (the cogwheel top right corner), then select ``Profile Settings`` (default). Here you see the option ``Custom native mode launch options``. Select ``Verus``.\n\nFirst copy and paste the code from below into the textfield and click ``Add launch option``.\n\n```\nminetolocalwallet=0\n```\n\nNext, copy and paste the code below. Change ``xxx`` to the ``public key`` we have from the hot wallet. Click ``Add launch option``.\n```\npubkey=xxx\n```\n\nAt last, click the ``Save Changes`` button. **Don't forget this step!** Now close the wallet and open it again. Congratulations, your stakes will now be diverted to your hot wallet.",
