    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi! I'm trying to get started with Verus Vault in Verus Desktop, but I'm not sure where to begin. Can you walk me through the setup process and explain the two ways to lock funds in a VerusID using Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that. To set up Verus Vault in Verus Desktop, you'll need the latest version of Verus Desktop and a VerusID on the Verus mainchain or any other chain when PBaaS is live. Verus Vault allows you to lock funds in your VerusID, making them unspendable until the lock is removed. However, you can still stake and receive coins while your funds are locked.\n\nThere are two ways to lock funds in a VerusID using Verus Vault: TimeLock and DelayLock.\n\n**TimeLock:** With a TimeLock, you can lock funds and specify a predetermined number of blocks until they are unlocked. For example, if you want to lock your VerusID for a year, you would need to know the current block height of the blockchain. Let's say the block height is 1,000,000 blocks. You would calculate the number of blocks in a year, which is approximately 508,994 blocks. Then, you would use the Verus Desktop commandline interface to set up a TimeLock for 508,994 blocks.\n\n**Note:** When locking funds for long-term periods, it's best to use an average block time of 62 seconds, considering variables like leap years. This translates to an average of 1394.5484 blocks per day.\n\n**DelayLock:** With a DelayLock, you can lock funds and specify a delay before they are unlocked. The funds will be locked until an unlock request is made and a predetermined number of blocks have passed.\n\nTo set up Verus Vault, access the commandline interface in Verus Desktop by going to Settings (the cogwheel icon) > Coin Settings. From there, you can fill in the commands to set up your Vault with either a TimeLock or DelayLock.\n\nDo you have any questions about the setup process or how TimeLock and DelayLock work?",

            "# Set up Verus Vault in Verus Desktop (easy method)\n![image-vaulteasy](/images/lockfunds2.png)\nVerus Vault is not yet accessible with clickable interfaces. You can still set up Vault in Verus Desktop. Here's how.What do you need:\n- Latest version Verus Desktop [download here](https://verus.io/wallet/desktop)\n- VerusID (on the Verus mainchain, or when PBaaS is live on any other chain)With Verus Vault you can lock funds in your VerusID. When your funds are locked in the Vault you can not spend them anymore, they cannot leave the VerusID. You can still always continue to stake and receive coins.You can lock a VerusID in two different ways that cannot be circumvented by anyone, except the ``revocation and recovery authorities`` together.| Lock type | How it works | \n| - |:-----|:-----|\n| TimeLock | Locks the funds and unlocks until a predetermined number of blocks have passed. | \n| DelayLock | Locks the funds and unlocks with a delay. Funds can not be spent until an unlock has been requested + a predetermined number of blocks have passed. |### Get Started\nWe need to access the commandline interface in Verus Desktop. Go to ``settings`` (the cogwheel top right corner), then select ``Coin Settings``. Here we can fill in the commands to set up your Vault.## Vault with TimeLock\n![image-timelock](/images/timeock.png)\nNow let's put a TimeLock on a VerusID. For a TimeLock you need to know the blockheight of the blockchain. Let's say the blockchain's blockheight is at ``1,000,000`` blocks. You want to lock your VerusID for 1 year. 1 year is ``508994`` blocks.::: warning Long-Term Locking\n**For long-term locking it's best to take an average block time of 62 seconds. Yet there are some variables that make it difficult to predict an exact time, leap years for example. Over long-term there are an average of 1394.5484 blocks per day.**\n:::",
