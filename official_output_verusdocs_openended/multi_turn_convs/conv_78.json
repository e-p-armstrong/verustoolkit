    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to launch a currency with a 1-to-1 mapping of an ERC-20, and I need some guidance on how to register a.vETH subID. Can you walk me through the process and provide the contract addresses involved?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRegistering a.vETH subID and launching a currency with a 1-to-1 mapping of an ERC-20 is a bit of a process, but I'd be happy to guide you through it.\n\nTo register a.vETH subID and launch a currency with a 1-to-1 mapping of an ERC-20, you need to follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Register a VerusID/subID**\nFirst, you need to register a VerusID/subID. This can be done by following the instructions in the VerusID creation guide.\n\n**Step 2: Pay the registration fee**\nThe cost of registering a.vETH subID is 0.01 vETH worth of Bridge.vETH. This fee needs to be paid in order to complete the registration process.\n\nNow, let's talk about the contract addresses involved in this process. There are three important ones to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Verus-Ethereum Bridge smart contract mainnet**: This is the contract address for the Verus-Ethereum Bridge smart contract on the mainnet. The address is 0x71518580f36FeCEFfE0721F06bA4703218cD7F63.\n2. **VRSC token address**: This is the contract address for the VRSC token. The address is 0xBc2738BA63882891094C99e59a02141Ca1a1C36a.\n3. **Bridge.vETH token address**: This is the contract address for the Bridge.vETH token. The address is 0xE6052Dcc60573561ECef2D9A4C0FEA6d3aC5B9A2.\n\nThese contract addresses are essential for the registration process and for interacting with the Verus-Ethereum Bridge.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the registration process or the contract addresses involved?",
