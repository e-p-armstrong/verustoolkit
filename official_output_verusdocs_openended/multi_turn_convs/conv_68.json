    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble setting up Verus Vault in Verus Desktop. Can you walk me through the process of locking funds in my VerusID, and explain the different lock types available?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that. To set up Verus Vault in Verus Desktop, you'll need the latest version of Verus Desktop and a VerusID on the Verus mainchain or any other chain when PBaaS is live. Verus Vault allows you to lock funds in your VerusID, making them unspendable, but still stakable and receivable. There are two types of locks: TimeLock and DelayLock.\n\n**TimeLock:**\nA TimeLock locks funds until a predetermined number of blocks have passed. To set up a TimeLock, you'll need to know the blockheight of the blockchain. For example, let's say the blockchain's blockheight is at 1,000,000 blocks, and you want to lock your VerusID for 1 year, which is approximately 508,994 blocks. You can use the command line interface in Verus Desktop to set up the TimeLock.\n\n**DelayLock:**\nA DelayLock locks funds and unlocks them with a delay. Funds cannot be spent until an unlock has been requested and a predetermined number of blocks have passed.\n\n**Getting Started:**\nTo set up Verus Vault, access the command line interface in Verus Desktop by going to \"settings\" (the cogwheel top right corner) and selecting \"Coin Settings\". Fill in the commands to set up your Vault.\n\n**Important Note:**\nFor long-term locking, it's best to take an average block time of 62 seconds into account. However, there are variables that make it difficult to predict an exact time, such as leap years. Over long-term, there are an average of 1394.5484 blocks per day.\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up Verus Vault in Verus Desktop and lock funds in your VerusID using either TimeLock or DelayLock. Do you have any more questions about Verus Vault or the lock types available?",

            "# Set up Verus Vault in Verus Desktop (flags)\n![image-vaulteasy](/images/lockfunds.png)\nVerus Vault is not yet accessible with clickable interfaces. You can still set up Vault in Verus Desktop. Here's how.What do you need:\n- Latest version Verus Desktop\n- VerusID (on the Verus mainchain, or when PBaaS is live on any other chain)With Verus Vault you can lock funds in your VerusID. When your funds are locked in the Vault you can not spend them anymore, they cannot leave the VerusID. You can still always continue to stake and receive coins.You can lock a VerusID in two different ways that cannot be circumvented by anyone, except the ``revocation and recovery authorities`` together.| Lock type | How it works | \n| - |:-----|:-----|\n| TimeLock | Locks the funds and unlocks until a predetermined number of blocks have passed. | \n| DelayLock | Locks the funds and unlocks with a delay. Funds can not be spent until an unlock has been requested + a predetermined number of blocks have passed. |### Get Started\nWe need to access the commandline interface in Verus Desktop. Go to ``settings`` (the cogwheel top right corner), then select ``Coin Settings``. Here we can fill in the commands to set up your Vault.## Vault with TimeLock\n![image-timelock](/images/timeock.png)\nNow let's put a Timelock on a VerusID. For a TimeLock you need to know the blockheight of the blockchain. Let's say the blockchain's blockheight is at ``1,000,000`` blocks. You want to lock your VerusID for 1 year. 1 year is ``508994`` blocks.::: warning Long-Term Locking\n**For long-term locking it's best to take an average block time of 62 seconds. Yet there are some variables that make it difficult to predict an exact time, leap years for example. Over long-term there are an average of 1394.5484 blocks per day.**\n:::",
