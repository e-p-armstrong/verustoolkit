    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been learning about VerusIDs, and I'm curious about multisig VerusIDs. Can you explain what they are and how they work in terms of setting up a wallet that requires multiple signatures to send a transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMultisig VerusIDs are a fascinating topic, and I'd be happy to dive into the details.\n\nA multisig VerusID is a type of VerusID that allows you to set up a wallet that requires multiple signatures to send a transaction. This means that instead of a single signature being sufficient to authorize a transaction, multiple signatures are required to validate and send the transaction.\n\nIn a multisig VerusID, you can specify the number of signatures required to send a transaction, out of a total possible number of signatures. For example, you could set up a wallet that requires two out of three possible signatures before a transaction can be sent. This adds an extra layer of security and flexibility to your wallet, as multiple parties can be involved in authorizing transactions.\n\nThe flexibility of multisig VerusIDs is further illustrated by the fact that they can be set up in various configurations, such as 13 of 25 signatures, 13 of 13 signatures, 1 of 25 signatures, or even 1 of 1 signature, which is equivalent to a standard single-signature VerusID.\n\nOverall, multisig VerusIDs provide a powerful tool for managing and securing transactions on the Verus network, and can be particularly useful in scenarios where multiple parties need to be involved in authorizing transactions.\n\nDo you have any more questions about multisig VerusIDs, or how they can be used in different scenarios?",
