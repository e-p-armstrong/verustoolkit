    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in learning more about Verus and its capabilities. Can you tell me about the key features and benefits of launching a blockchain using Verus, and how can users create their own tokens or blockchains without needing to program?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLaunching a blockchain using Verus is a powerful way to create a customizable, interoperable, and independent blockchain with a range of features. Here are some of the key benefits and features of launching a blockchain using Verus:\n\n**L1 Features:**\nVerus blockchains come with a range of L1 features, including:\n\n* **L1 Multi-currency**: Consensus layer basket currencies, simple token currencies, and decentralized crowdfund mechanisms.\n* **L1 DeFi**: Consensus layer Automated Market Makers (AMMs), MEV-free, no front/back-running, and fully decentralized marketplace.\n* **L1 VerusID**: Consensus layer self-sovereign identities, namespace for currencies, tokens, and PBaaS-blockchains, friendly-name addresses, revocable, recoverable, NFTs, profiles, and binding to any type of data.\n* **L1 Privacy**: Consensus layer zk-SNARKs privacy technology.\n\n**Security and Performance:**\nVerus blockchains are designed to be secure and high-performance, with:\n\n* **51% hash attack resistance**: 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake, making them resistant to 51% hash attacks.\n* **High performance**: 75-800 transactions per second (TPS), with adjustable block times from 10 seconds to 2 minutes.\n\n**Scalability:**\nVerus blockchains can scale out by deploying more interoperable, interconnected PBaaS-chains.\n\n**Launch without Programming:**\nOne of the key benefits of Verus is that users can launch their own tokens or blockchains without needing to program. This is made possible by the VerusID system, which enables any user to create their own token currency or full-fledged blockchain. The cost of launching a PBaaS-chain is 10,000 VRSC, which is split between the Verus block producers and the block producers of the newly launched chain.\n\nOverall, Verus provides a powerful and flexible platform for launching customizable, interoperable, and independent blockchains, with a range of features and benefits that make it an attractive option for users.\n\nDo you have any further questions about launching a blockchain using Verus, or about creating your own tokens or blockchains without programming?",
