    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to update my VerusID with a timelock and a DelayLock, but I'm not sure how to do it. Could you walk me through the process and explain the implications of using these features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help. \n\nTo update a VerusID with a timelock, you can use the `updateidentity` command in the Verus Desktop command-line interface. A timelock is a feature that locks a VerusID for a specified period of time, preventing the funds associated with it from being spent. To set a timelock, you need to specify the following parameters:\n\n* `name`: The name of your VerusID, without the `@` symbol.\n* `primaryaddress`: The R-address of your VerusID, which can be found in the \"VerusID\" tab of the Verus Desktop interface.\n* `timelock`: The number of blocks that the VerusID will be locked for. For example, to lock the VerusID for approximately 1 year, you would set `timelock` to `1534360`.\n\nHere is an example of the command:\n```json\nupdateidentity \n'{\n  \"name\":\"youridentityname\",\n  \"minimumsignatures\":1,\n  \"primaryaddresses\":[\"primary-address-comes-here\"],\n  \"flags\":0,\n  \"timelock\":1534360\n}'\n```\nA DelayLock is a type of timelock that allows you to specify a delay period before the VerusID can be unlocked. To set a DelayLock, you need to specify the same parameters as for a timelock, but with a different value for `timelock`. For example, to set a DelayLock of 1 week, you would set `timelock` to `10080`, which is the number of blocks in a week (1440 blocks per day x 7 days).\n\nIt's important to note that you can always revoke and recover a locked VerusID, which means that you can regain control of the associated funds if needed.\n\nBy using a timelock or DelayLock, you can add an extra layer of security to your VerusID and prevent unauthorized access to your funds. However, it's essential to carefully consider the implications of using these features, as they can also limit your ability to access your funds for a specified period of time.\n\nDo you have any more questions about updating your VerusID with a timelock or DelayLock, or would you like me to clarify any of the implications of using these features?",

            "- Under ``timelock`` you put ``1508994``\n- Under ``name`` you put your VerusID name without ``@``\n- Under ``primaryaddress`` you put the R-address which is the primary address of your VerusID (you can find this address in the 'VerusID'-tab, open your VerusID and click `ID Info')So in our example your VerusID is locked for approximately for 1 year. After that period of time the funds can be spent again.``` json\nrun updateidentity \n'{\n  \"name\":\"youridentityname\",\n  \"minimumsignatures\":1,\n  \"primaryaddresses\":[\"primary-address-comes-here\"],\n  \"flags\":0,\n  \"timelock\":1534360\n}'\n```You can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs. In the code snippet are the minimum requirements to update your VerusID with a lock.:::tip Revoke & Recover\nRemember: you can always revoke and recover a locked VerusID.\n:::## Vault with DelayLock\n![image-delaylock](/images/delaylock.png)\nNow let's put a DelayLock on a VerusID. This means that you lock the identity, and when you request the identity to be unlocked, a predetermined number of blocks have to pass before you can actually spend the funds again.### Set the DelayLock\nLet's say you want to put a Delaylock of 1 week. 1 week is ``10,080`` blocks (1440x7). This will lock the identity, and when you requested an unlock, it takes 1 week (or 10,080 blocks) before the funds can be spent again.- Under ``timelock`` you put ``10080``\n- Under ``name`` you put your VerusID name without ``@``\n- Under ``primaryaddress`` you put the R-address which is the primary address of your VerusID (you can find this address in the 'VerusID'-tab, open your VerusID and click `ID Info')",
