    "How do I request an unlock on my VerusID using the `setidentitytimelock` command, and what does the `unlockatblock` parameter do?",
    "To request an unlock on your VerusID, you can use the `setidentitytimelock` command in the Verus Desktop command-line interface. This command allows you to set a time lock on your identity, which can be useful for various purposes.\n\nThe `unlockatblock` parameter is an important part of this command. It specifies the block height at which the time lock should be removed, allowing you to regain access to your identity. To request an unlock, you need to know the current block height of the blockchain.\n\nHere's how it works: if the current block height is, for example, 1,000,000, you can set `unlockatblock` to 999,999 or simply 0. Setting it to 0 is recommended, as it will immediately request an unlock.\n\nHere's an example of the command you would use:\n```json\nrun setidentitytimelock \"myid@\" \n'{\n  \"unlockatblock\":0\n}'\n```\nJust replace \"myid@\" with your actual VerusID, and you're good to go! This command will request an unlock on your identity, and once the specified block height is reached, the time lock will be removed, and you'll regain access to your identity.\n\nRemember to always be careful when using the `setidentitytimelock` command, as it can have significant consequences for your identity and its associated assets. Make sure you understand the implications of using this command before proceeding.",
    "To request an unlock you need to know the blockheight of the blockchain. Under ``unlockatblock`` you can fill in whatever the current blockheight is minus 1. So if the blockheight is at 1,000,000 you can fill in ``999999`` or just ``0`` (recommended) to immediately request an unlock.\n\n``` json\nrun setidentitytimelock \"myid@\" \n'{\n  \"unlockatblock\":0\n}'\n```\n\nYou can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs.",
