    "What are the requirements and steps to launch a new currency on Verus with a 1:1 mapping to an ERC-20 token on Ethereum?",
    "Launching a new currency on Verus with a 1:1 mapping to an ERC-20 token on Ethereum involves several steps. Here's a detailed guide to help you through the process:\n\n**Step 1: Create a VerusID**\nTo create a currency, you need a VerusID with the same name as the currency you want to launch. The controller of this VerusID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and this can only be done once. The cost for a VerusID on Verus is 100 VRSC (or 80 VRSC when using a referral).\n\n**Step 2: Register a.vETH subID (Optional)**\nAlternatively, you can use a.vETH subID, which costs 0.01 vETH worth of Bridge.vETH to register.\n\n**Step 3: Prepare the VerusID namespace**\nBefore launching the currency, ensure you have enough VRSC in the namespace VerusID.\n\n**Step 4: Define the currency**\nTo define the currency, you need to map it to an ERC-20 token on Ethereum using a command like the one shown in the example. The `address` field should contain the Ethereum smart contract address of the ERC-20 token you want to map to.\n\n**Example Command:**\nThe command to map a currency 1:1 to an ERC-20 on Ethereum is:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"MyUSDC\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"usdc\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000}'\n```\n**Using the Verus-Ethereum Bridge:**\nTo use the Verus-Ethereum Bridge, you can access the testnet bridge at [https://ethbridge.verustest.net/](https://ethbridge.verustest.net/) or the mainnet bridge at [https://eth.verusbridge.io](https://eth.verusbridge.io).\n\n**Getting Help:**\nIf you need help setting up a currency launch, you can reach out to the Verus community on the #pbaas-development channel on Discord at [https://www.verus.io/discord](https://www.verus.io/discord).",
    "# Launch currency with 1:1 mapping of ERC-20When defining a currency it can be mapped to an ERC-20 1:1. The currency on Verus and the ERC-20 on Ethereum are then always interchangeable 1 to 1.

The community is happy to assist!](https://www.verus.io/discord)\n:::### Defining the currency\nTo create a currency of a specific name, we need a VerusID of the same name. The controller of this VerusID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and we can only do so once.The cost for a VerusID on the Verus is ``100 VRSC`` (or 80 when using a referral). The cost to launch a currency is ``200 VRSC``. Before launching we need to have enough VRSC in the namespace VerusID.You can also use a .vETH subID. The cost to register a .vETH subID is an amount of Bridge.vETH (0.01 vETH worth).In our example we have a namespace ``MyUSDC`` with which we want to launch a currency that is mapped to the Ethereum ``USDC`` ERC-20 (on Goerli testnet, [see contract address](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x98339D8C260052B7ad81c28c16C0b98420f2B46a)).Below is the command to map a currency 1:1 to an ERC-20 on Ethereum. The ``address`` field is the Ethereum smart contract address of the ERC-20 we want to map to.",
