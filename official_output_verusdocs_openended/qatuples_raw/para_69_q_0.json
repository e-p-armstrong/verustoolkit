    "What features does Verus offer for crowdfunding currency and blockchain launches, and how does its multichain network enable interoperability between blockchains?",
    "Verus offers a range of features for crowdfunding currency and blockchain launches. One key feature is the ability to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in preferred currencies on the chain. If these minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees.\n\nAdditionally, Verus provides various launch options, including:\n\n* Maximum participation in one or more currencies\n* Pre-launch discounts\n* Price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, which increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies\n* Price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds\n* Pre-launch discounts for early participants\n* Vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs\n\nVerus also enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains within its multichain network. This is made possible through the use of Notary IDs, which provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This allows for public blockchains to be made available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which can be easily set up with bridging of public currencies into an organization's internal private network and back.\n\nThe Verus network is designed to be fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. While there may be some overhead for cross-notarization, the network is capable of supporting a large number of blockchains, with no limit on the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate simultaneously.",
    "## Crowdfunding currency and blockchain launches\nSet required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees.\n\nThe launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n\n## Interoperable, multichain network\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.\n\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access.\n\nThere is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.",
