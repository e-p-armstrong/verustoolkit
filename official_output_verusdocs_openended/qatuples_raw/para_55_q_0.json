    "How do I launch a new currency on Verus, and what are the requirements and costs associated with it?",
    "To launch a new currency on Verus, you need to define the currency using the `definecurrency` command, which is processed into a HEX and broadcasted to the network. The fees for launching a currency are taken from the rootID and distributed among the block producers. After a minimum period of 20 blocks, the currency is launched and ready to be used by the worldwide network.\n\nBefore launching a currency, you need a namespace, which is a VerusID. This VerusID is the name of the currency, and it can have subIDs. The controller of this VerusID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\n\nThe costs of launching a currency on Verus include the registration of the VerusID, which costs between 20 and 100 VRSC, and the launch of the currency itself, which costs 200 VRSC. These costs are always paid in the chain's native coin to the worldwide miners and stakers.\n\nWhen defining a currency, you need to choose options that combine to meet the needs of the currency. These options are added together in the currency definition, and they determine the characteristics of the currency. For example, the `proofprotocol` option determines the type of proof used to secure the currency, and the `preallocations` option determines the initial distribution of the currency.\n\nHere is an example of a simple currency definition:\n```json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"MyBrand\", \n \"options\":32, \n \"proofprotocol\":2, \n \"preallocations\":[{\"Klaus@\":100}]\n}'\n```\nThis command defines a currency called \"MyBrand\" with options 32, proof protocol 2, and an initial allocation of 100 units to the address \"Klaus@\".",

The community is happy to assist!](https://www.verus.io/discord)\n:::![image-currencies-launching](/images/launching-currencies.png)This is what a (simple) currency definition looks like:``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"MyBrand\", \n \"options\":32, \n \"proofprotocol\":2, \n \"preallocations\":[{\"Klaus@\":100}]\n}'\n```The above command is processed into a HEX, and that HEX is broadcasted to the network. Simultaneously the fees are taken from the rootID (and distributed among the block producers) and after waiting a minimum period of 20 blocks the currency is launched and ready to be used by the worldwide network.## VerusID namespace\nTo launch a currency on Verus (and any other PBaaS-chain) a namespace is needed. That namespace is a VerusID. The namespace is the name of the currency (e.g. ``MyBrand@``). That namespace can also have subIDs (e.g. ``product.MyBrand@``, ``user.MyBrand@``). The controller of this VerusID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.On Verus a VerusID registration costs between 20 and 100 VRSC, and the launch of a currency costs 200 VRSC. These costs are always paid in the chain\u2019s native coin (to the worldwide miners and stakers). On other PBaaS-chains these costs can differ since the chain launcher can define its own costs for VerusID registrations and currency launches.## Defining options\nTo define a currency, choose options. Then combine these options to whatever the currency needs to be. Just add the numbers together in the currency definition. The currency options are listed below.",
