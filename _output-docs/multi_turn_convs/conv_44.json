    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHi! I'm trying to understand how to define a PBaaS blockchain. Specifically, what's the purpose of the `options` parameter, and how do I use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `options` parameter is used to customize the behavior of your PBaaS blockchain by combining various options. These options define different use cases for your blockchain, such as allowing fractional reserve conversions, enabling ID staking, or setting up a token-based system. You can combine these options by adding their corresponding values together in the `options` parameter. Does that make sense? Do you have any specific options you're interested in using?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually, I was wondering about the `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` option. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` option allows reserve conversions using base calculations when set. This means that your blockchain will support fractional reserve conversions, which can be useful in certain use cases. Do you think you'll need fractional reserve conversions in your blockchain?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that helps. Now, how do I create a blockchain of a specific name using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a blockchain of a specific name, you need a VerusID of the same name. The controller of this VerusID is the only one who can create a blockchain of that name, and they can only do so once. Make sure you have the necessary VerusID before trying to create the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! One last question: what's the recommended limit for currency supplies in a Verus blockchain, and why is it important to follow this limit?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe recommended limit for currency supplies in a Verus blockchain is 10 billion (with 8 decimal places: 9999999999.99999999). This limit is important to follow because it prevents potential issues with conversions and extended tail emissions over time. It's a good idea to stick to this limit to avoid any potential problems with your blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I think I have a better understanding of Verus now.",
