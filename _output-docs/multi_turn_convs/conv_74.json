    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nHi! I'm still learning about Verus, and I have a few questions about creating new currencies. What is the purpose of the `sendrawtransaction` command in Verus, and what are the requirements for using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendrawtransaction` command is used to launch a new currency on the Verus network. To use it, you need to provide a HEX value as input, which is obtained by running a previous command. Additionally, you must ensure that the rootID has enough funds to cover the currency fee (200.0002 VRSC) and the initial contribution. Do you have any further questions about this command or creating currencies on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! So, how long does it take for a new currency to launch on Verus after running the `sendrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter running the `sendrawtransaction` command, it takes a minimum of 20 blocks (or the specified start block) for the currency to launch, provided all preconversion goals are met. So, it's not an instant process, but it's relatively fast. Do you have any more questions about currency creation or management on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing. How can I retrieve information about a currency on Verus, such as its status or properties?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrency` command to retrieve information about a currency on Verus. The command format is:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency \"CurrencyName\"\n```\nReplace \"CurrencyName\" with the actual name of the currency you want to lookup. This command will give you the information you need about the currency. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
