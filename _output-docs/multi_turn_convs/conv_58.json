    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey, what's on your mind today? Do you have any questions about Verus or VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm curious about VerusIDs. What can a VerusID be bound to?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID can be bound to various things, such as a person or another VerusID with authority or ownership, unlimited amounts of content, data, and provable information (both public and private), and provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the VerusID itself. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What are some of the features and capabilities of a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the features and capabilities of a VerusID include holding funds, being a personal profile, corporate website, or government portal, being revoked and recovered, setting time locks, being controlled by any number of identities, signing and verifying data, files, and messages, having privacy through added z-addresses, sending and receiving messages, and communicating in standardized ways through the Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF). That's quite a list, isn't it?\n\n**User:**\nDefinitely. What is the significance of a VerusID in creating PBaaS-chains, tokens, and currencies on the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is necessary to create PBaaS-chains, tokens, and currencies on the Verus blockchain. The name assigned to the VerusID is also the name of the PBaaS-chain, token, or currency. Each PBaaS-chain has standard VerusID support, and creators of these chains can assign the costs of identities themselves. Does that help clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that makes sense. Can a VerusID have an easy-to-remember name, and what characters are available to create a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, a VerusID can have an easy-to-remember name chosen by the user. All characters from all character sets (except `/`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `\"`, `<`, `>`, `|`, `@`, and `.`) are available to create a VerusID.\n\n**User:**\nHow much does a VerusID cost on the Verus blockchain, and can the cost be discounted?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID costs 100 VRSC on the Verus blockchain. However, the cost can be discounted with referrals, and the discounted cost would be 80 VRSC. All costs paid go to the miners and stakers of the ecosystem and to the referrals if used.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. How does the referral system for VerusIDs work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe referral system rewards users with identities. For each VerusID a user creates, the referral identity receives 20 VRSC. The referral system goes three levels down. Does that make sense?",
