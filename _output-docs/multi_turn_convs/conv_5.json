    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about Notary IDs. What role do they play in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. Would you like to know more about private, internal blockchains on the Verus network?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What benefits do private, internal blockchains offer on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPrivate, internal blockchains on the Verus network offer all the features and currencies of the public chain, but with restricted access. They are also easy to set up, with simple bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network, and back. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and control. Do you have any more questions about private, internal blockchains or would you like to know more about the Verus network in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. Is there a limit to the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, there is no limit to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. The Verus network's fractal model enables an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. This allows for a high degree of scalability and flexibility, making it possible for many different use cases and applications to be built on top of the Verus network. Does that answer your question?",
