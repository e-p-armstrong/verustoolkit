    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey! I'm trying to bridge some assets from Verus to Ethereum and I have a few questions about it. What are the possible values for the **``From Currency``** field?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen bridging assets from Verus to Ethereum, the possible values for the **``From Currency``** field are ``veth``, ``dai.veth``, ``mkr.veth``, ``vrsc`` or other bridged assets. The input is not capital sensitive. Do you have any other questions about bridging assets?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the value of the **``Destination System``** field when bridging assets from Verus to Ethereum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen bridging assets from Verus to Ethereum, the value of the **``Destination System``** field is ``veth`` for Ethereum. That's the identifier for the Ethereum system. Do you have any more questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the **``Refund Address``** field when bridging assets from Verus to Ethereum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe **``Refund Address``** field is your Verus address (R-, i- or VerusID), which is used to refund the assets if the bridging process fails. So, it's like a safety net in case something goes wrong during the bridging process.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I bridge assets from Verus to Ethereum using the command-line interface?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can bridge assets from Verus to Ethereum using the following command:\n```\njson./verus sendcurrency \"*\" '[{ \"currency\":\"veth\", \"exportto\":\"veth\", \"address\":\"ETH-ADDRESS\", \"amount\":100, \"refundto\":\"VERUS-ADDRESS\" }]'\n```\nReplace ``ETH-ADDRESS`` with your Ethereum address and ``VERUS-ADDRESS`` with your Verus address. Make sure to adjust the amount and other parameters according to your needs.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the default currency used to pay fees when bridging assets from Verus to Ethereum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default currency used to pay fees when bridging assets from Verus to Ethereum is VRSC. However, you can specify ``\"feecurrency\":\"veth\"`` to pay the fees in vETH instead. So, you have the flexibility to choose the currency for paying fees.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.",
