    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! How can I help you today?\n\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to figure out how to package a VerusPay Invoice into a deeplink or QR code readable by wallets like Verus Mobile. Can you walk me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo package a VerusPay Invoice into a deeplink or QR code, you need to:\n\n1. Serialize the invoice using a specific method, without its 20-byte VDXF key.\n2. Format the invoice bytes into a base64url string.\n3. Create a deeplink URL in the format: `[vrsc::applications.wallet VDXF ID]://x-callback-url/[veruspay.vrsc::invoice VDXF ID]/[VerusPay invoice bytes in base64url format]`.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any questions about the process?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I think I understand. But what's the purpose of the deeplink URL created for a VerusPay Invoice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe deeplink URL created for a VerusPay Invoice is used to trigger an invoice request when scanned by a VerusPay supporting wallet application, such as Verus Mobile, or linked to by an application or service.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! Can you give an example of a deeplink URL created for a VerusPay Invoice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, an example of a deeplink URL is: `i5jtwbp6zymeay9llnraglgjqgdrffsau4://x-callback-url/iEETy7La3FTN2Sd2hNRgepek5S8x8eeUeQ/AzABpJ-uxwACFAAtMxHDi_0hkJLSrvRJgEvos77-pu-eojVjXjKBJP80KdufnpG2Ti0`.\n\nDoes that help?",
