    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about Bridge.vETH. How does the supply of Bridge.vETH change over time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe supply of Bridge.vETH is dynamic and changes when people convert other currencies to or from Bridge.vETH. When someone converts VRSC, ETH, DAI, or MKR to Bridge.vETH, the currency is minted, increasing the supply. Conversely, when someone converts from Bridge.vETH back to one of these currencies, the currency is burned, decreasing the supply. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. What are the advantages of converting currencies using Bridge.vETH or other basket currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nConverting currencies using Bridge.vETH or other basket currencies has several advantages. It is MEV-resistant, which means it is resistant to miner extractable value attacks. Additionally, it has no smart contract risks due to protocol-level security, and it has low fees, capped at 0.05%. So, you get security, resistance to certain attacks, and low costs!\n\n**User:**\nI'm also interested in a.vETH subIDs. What are they, and how can I register one?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA.vETH subID is a way to launch a currency with a 1-to-1 mapping of an ERC-20. To register a.vETH subID, you need to pay 0.01 vETH worth of Bridge.vETH. You can learn more about how to register a VerusID/subID on the Verus website. We have detailed instructions there to guide you through the process.",
