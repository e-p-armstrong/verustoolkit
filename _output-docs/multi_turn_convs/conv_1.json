Where can I copy and paste the code snippet to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can copy and paste the code snippet into the command line interface of Verus Desktop. That should help you unlock your VerusID and access your wallet.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I've pasted the code snippet. What's next? Do I need to perform a transaction or access my wallet somehow?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter copying and pasting the code snippet, you need to edit the necessary inputs for your specific needs.
