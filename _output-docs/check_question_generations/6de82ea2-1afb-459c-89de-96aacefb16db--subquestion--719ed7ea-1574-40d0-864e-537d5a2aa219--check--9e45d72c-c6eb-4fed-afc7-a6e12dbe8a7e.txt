    When running `./verusd` on a Linux distro (eg Debian or Devuan), not all dependencies
    may be installed by default, resulting in the errormessage `error while loading
    shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` or `error while loading
    shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory`.


    To solve this you need to install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries:

    `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`

    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is ava\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text):\n\

    ### In-Depth Analysis of the Text:

    #### Content and Depth: The text discusses the benefits of VerusIDs as a fully
    functional blockchain protocol, outlining how they are quantum-friendly, fully-decentralized,
    revocable, recoverable, private, & powerful.

    #### Type of Information: The information is descriptive/educational, teaching

    ### Detailed Understanding of the Question:

    #### Core Requirement: The question asks broadly about what crypto-addresses are
    and how they ensure privacy.

    #### Depth of Detail: The question requires information about crypto-addresses
    in general, including how they help ensure privacy of their users.


    ### Targeted Comparison of the Question with the Text:

    #### Content Match: The text talks about VerusIDs (a type of crypto-address) and
    the benefits of VerusIDs, whereas the question addresses crypto-addresses in general.
    This is something of a mismatch, as the text does not discuss crypto-addresses
    in general.

    #### Depth Match: The text lacks information on crypto-addresses in general, instead
    focusing on VerusIDs. The privacy benefits of VerusIDs are mentioned, but not
    the privacy benefits of crypto-addresses in general.


    ### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:

    Although the text describes a specific type of crypto-address (VerusIDs), it does
    not cover crypto-addresses in general, nor does it talk about the privacy conferred
    by crypto-addresses in general, as is required by the question, making it: IRRELEVANT.'

    \ is a universal component used within the Verus blockchain network, designed\
    \ to define destinations within blockchain operations comprehensively. This construct\
    \ is crucial for specifying the end points in a variety of blockchain transactions,\
    \ supporting a wide array of destination types to accommodate diverse blockchain\
    \ functionalities and cross-chain interactions.## Core ConceptsTransfer Destination\
    \ encapsulates key information necessary for blockchain transactions, including\
    \ the destination type, destination-specific bytes, gateway information, and associated\
    \ fees. It supports a flexible architecture for defining complex transaction paths,\
    \ enhancing the blockchain's capability to handle sophisticated and multi-layered\
    \ operations.### Destination TypesThe Transfer Destination construct supports\
    \ various destination types, each serving specific purposes:- **DEST_INVALID (0)**:\
    \ Represents an invalid or unspecified destination type, used as a default or\
    \ error state. - **DEST_PK (1)**: Indicates a public key destination, typically\
    \ used for transactions directly to a public key. - **DEST_PKH (2)**: Stands for\
    \ a public key hash destination, common in many blockchain platforms for sending\
    \ transactions to a hashed version of a public key (e.g. an r-address). - **DEST_SH\
    \ (3)**: Represents a script hash destination, used for transactions that should\
    \ be processed by a specific script, enabling smart contracts or complex spending\
    \ conditions. - **DEST_ID (4)**: Identifies a [**VerusID**](/verusid/) destination.\
    \ - **DEST_FULLID (5)**: - **DEST_REGISTERCURRENCY (6)**: - **DEST_QUANTUM (7)**:\
    \ Used for quantum-resistant addresses. - **DEST_NESTEDTRANSFER (8)**: - **DEST_ETH\
    \ (9)**: Specifies an Ethereum account as the destination, facilitating cross-chain\
    \ transactions with Ethereum. - **DEST_ETHNFT (10)**: Indicates a destination\
    \ for an Ethereum-compatible Non-Fungible Token (NFT), enabling the mapping of\
    \ NFTs across different blockchain systems. - **DEST_RAW (11)**: Represents a\
    \ raw data destination, allowing for arbitrary data to be included as a destination,\
    \ offering maximum flexibility.### FlagsTransfer Destination also supports the\
    \ use of flags to indicate additional attributes of a destination:\n\"\"\"\n\n\
