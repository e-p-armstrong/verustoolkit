    "How do I launch a PBaaS-chain using Verus?",
    "To launch a PBaaS-chain using Verus, you need to have a VerusID and 10,000 VRSC, which will be split between the Verus block producers and the block producers of the newly launched chain. No programming is required, and you can create your own token currency or full-fledged blockchain with DeFi capabilities.",
    "# Introduction Launch blockchains that are \u2705 **fully interoperable**, \u2705 **customizable** and \u2705 **independent**. Each blockchain launched has the following L1 features.| Feature | Details | | :-----| :------ | | [L1 Multi-currency](/currencies/) | Consensus layer basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools) & simple token currencies, decentralized crowdfund mechanisms | | [L1 DeFi](/sendcurrency/) | Consensus layer AMMs, MEV-free, no front/back-running, solving all conversions simultaneously within a block & fully decentralized marketplace | | [L1 VerusID](/verusid/) | Consensus layer self-sovereign identities, namespace for currencies, tokens & PBaaS-blockchains, friendly-name addresses, revocable, recoverable, NFTs, profiles, can be bound to any type of data | | L1 Privacy | Consensus layer zk-SNARKs privacy technology | | 51% hash attack resistant | 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake.

In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, VerusID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.## DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets Any VerusID owner may define basket currencies, with one or more reserves backing the currency, at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing.",
