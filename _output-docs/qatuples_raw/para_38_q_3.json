    "How can I retrieve the information associated with a VerusID, such as \"Verus Coin Foundation@\"?",
    "You can use the `getidentity` command to retrieve the information associated with a VerusID. For example:\n\n```\n./verus getidentity \"Verus Coin Foundation@\"\n```\n\nThis command will return a JSON object containing the details of the VerusID, including its fully qualified name, primary addresses, identity address, revocation authority, recovery authority, and content map.",
    "If one owns three identities that are stringed together through its referrals, one can receive 60 VRSC with each VerusID creation. This way an identity only has to cost 20 VRSC.::: tip Support the Verus Vision Use ``Verus Coin Foundation@`` when creating a VerusID on the Verus blockchain. All proceeds will go to the further development of the Verus vision. :::## Structure An example of a VerusID: | Structure | Information | | :----------------------- | :--------------------- | | **VerusID Name** | The name is a unique namespace and human readable cryptocurrency address. | | **Primary Address** | The primary address is the owner of the VerusID, as it contains the private key. It can contain more than one VerusID. | | **Identity Address** | The identity address is, next to the name, the identifier of the VerusID. | | **Private Address** | An optional attached private z-address | | **Revocation Authority** | The identity address that can revoke the VerusID | | **Recovery Authority** | The identity address that can recover the VerusID | | **Contentmap** | VDXF key/value data |Input: ``` ./verus getidentity \"Verus Coin Foundation@\" ``` Output: ``` json { \"fullyqualifiedname\": \"Verus Coin Foundation.VRSC@\", \"identity\": { \"version\": 3, \"flags\": 0, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"REpxm9bCLMiHRNVPA9unPBWixie7uHFA5C\"], \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"name\": \"Verus Coin Foundation\", \"identityaddress\": \"i5v3h9FWVdRFbNHU7DfcpGykQjRaHtMqu7\", \"parent\": \"i5w5MuNik5NtLcYmNzcvaoixooEebB6MGV\", \"systemid\": \"i5w5MuNik5NtLcYmNzcvaoixooEebB6MGV\", \"contentmap\": {",
