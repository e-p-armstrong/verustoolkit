    "How does VerusPoP incentivize holders to support the network, and what happens to the PoW/PoS ratio if there is a change in network hashrate?",
    "VerusPoP provides a decentralizing effect on the network by incentivizing holders to keep nodes online to support the network. Even if there is a change in network hashrate, the PoW/PoS ratio remains the same, at 50/50%. This ensures that the network remains balanced and secure.",
    "# Verus Proof of Power VerusPoP is a 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. [More information on the Verus miner and staker ecosystem](/economy/).## Hybrid Consensus Verus Proof of Power, or VerusPoP, is a hybrid consensus algorithm which uses a statistical function that combines Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate each block by either PoW or PoS, while averaging to a target percentage of blocks being validated by each form of proof.In short, it a unique consensus mechanism with 50% of all blocks validated by miners, and the other 50% by stakers.## Attack Resistant To successfully attack the Verus blockchain, more than 50% of the validation power is needed, called ``Chain Power``. A 51% attack would require a combined value of over 50% of both the chain\u2019s hashpower and its coin supply. [For technical information on VerusPoP read the whitepaper](https://verus.io/docs/VerusPoP.pdf).VerusPoP provides a decentralizing effect on the network, incentivizing holders to keep nodes online to support the network. Even if a change in network hashrate happens, the PoW/PoS ratio stays the same: 50/50%.## VerusHash 2.2 [From the VerusPoP whitepaper](https://verus.io/docs/VerusPoP.pdf):\"VerusHash is specifically developed to deliver a competitive advantage for CPUs with GPUs. It is an exceedingly CPU-friendly long input hash function that uses the quantum-secure, short input Haraka512 V2 as its core compression algorithm. The result is the fastest known cryptocurrency hash algorithm available to modern CPUs and the only hash algorithm which enables today\u2019s CPUs and GPUs to compete on an economically comparable level.Haraka512 V2 is designed as a short input hash to exclusively consume one chunk of 512 bits and produce 256 bits of a hash result. Utilizing Haraka512 V2 VerusHash takes any length of input and produces a 256 bit hash result, unique to VerusHash, that also provides the same security guarantees as Haraka512 V2. This makes VerusHash 256 bit secure for classical computing attacks and 128 bit secure against quantum computers for pre-image and second pre-image attacks.",
