    "How do I set a DelayLock on a VerusID using the command line interface?",
    "To set a DelayLock on a VerusID, you can use the following command:\n```json\nrun updateidentity '{ \n  \"name\":\"youridentityname\", \n  \"minimumsignatures\":1, \n  \"primaryaddresses\":[\"primary-address-comes-here\"], \n  \"flags\":2, \n  \"timelock\":10080 \n}'\n```\n Replace \"youridentityname\" with your VerusID name (without the \"@\"), \"primary-address-comes-here\" with your primary address (found in the \"VerusID\" tab), and \"10080\" with the number of blocks you want the DelayLock to last (e.g., 1 week is 10,080 blocks).",
    "You can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs. In the code snippet are the minimum requirements to update your VerusID with a lock.:::tip Revoke & Recover Remember: you can always revoke and recover a locked VerusID. :::## Vault with DelayLock ![image-delaylock](/images/delaylock.png) Now let's put a DelayLock on a VerusID. This means that you lock the identity, and when you request the identity to be unlocked, a predetermined number of blocks have to pass before you can actually spend the funds again.### Set the DelayLock Let's say you want to put a Delaylock of 1 week. 1 week is ``10,080`` blocks (1440x7). This will lock the identity, and when you requested an unlock, it takes 1 week (or 10,080 blocks) before the funds can be spent again.- Under ``timelock`` you put ``10080`` - Under ``name`` you put your VerusID name without ``@`` - Under ``primaryaddress`` you put the R-address which is the primary address of your VerusID (you can find this address in the 'VerusID'-tab, open your VerusID and click `ID Info')``` json run updateidentity '{    \"name\":\"youridentityname\",   \"minimumsignatures\":1,   \"primaryaddresses\":[\"primary-address-comes-here\"],   \"flags\":2,   \"timelock\":10080   }' ```You can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs. In the code snippet are the minimum requirements to update your VerusID with a lock.:::tip Revoke & Recover Remember: you can always revoke and recover a locked VerusID. :::### Request an unlock Above you locked a VerusID with a DelayLock. Now let's request an unlock. When an unlock has been requested you have to wait the predetermined number of blocks before you can spend the funds again.Fill in your VerusID ``name``, the ``primary address`` and set ``flags`` to 0. Now you only have to wait for your predetermined number of blocks (10,080 in our example) to run out so you can spend the funds again.``` json run updateidentity '{    \"name\":\"youridentityname\",   \"minimumsignatures\":1,   \"primaryaddresses\":[\"primary-address-comes-here\"],   \"flags\":0   }' ```",
