    "How does Verus enable interoperability between different blockchains?",
    "Verus enables a world where all blockchains communicate with each other through its interoperable and interconnected PBaaS-chains, and also connects to Ethereum in a trustless and non-custodial way.",
    "Verus' scale out TPS (transactions-per-second) is better than what other blockchains have today. A single PBaaS chain can reach between 75 and 800 TPS depending on blocktime; a network of several thousand chains would have a total bandwidth of 1 million+ TPS. But there is no maximum TPS metric because such a thing does not exist on an open fractal network like Verus.* **Create use case specific blockchains and currencies** * **Move activity between chains to avoid congestion**## Security Verus and its PBaaS-blockchains are 51% hash attack resistant. All functionality can be found in the consensus layer (L1), making the protocol secure for developers and users. No smart contract risks \u2014 Verus uses smart transactions, not smart contracts.* **51% hash attack resistant through [Verus Proof of Power](/overview/verus-proof-of-power/)** * Read: [Verus Smart Transactions vs. Smart Contracts](https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-smart-transactions-vs-smart-contracts-f98079c00ed0)## Interoperability Verus enables a world where all blockchains communicate with each other. All PBaaS-chains are interoperable and interconnected. Verus and all PBaaS-chains are now also connected to Ethereum, in a trustless and non-custodial way.* Read: [Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) \u2014 Provable, Decentralized Cross-chain Communication](https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-internet-protocol-vip-provable-decentralized-cross-chain-communication-8d9414a429c5) * [Verus-Ethereum Bridge](/eth-bridge/)## Decentralized & community-built Verus is a decentralized public blockchain, a community driven project in the true spirit of Bitcoin. Anyone can participate and contribute, no matter who you are or where you come from. Verus is: * **Open** * **Borderless** * **Public** * **Neutral** * **Censorship resistant**Anyone can start mining and staking the Verus Protocol. Mobile phones and ARMs (e.g. Orange Pi 5) are the most energy efficient devices to mine Verus (and 22 other PBaaS-chains) with. To stake there are no minimum requirements or locking of funds.There is no company behind Verus, it is community-built. All protocol fees go to the block producers of the network (the miners and stakers).These characteristics that anyone can participate in the Verus Protocol makes it one of the most decentralized networks worldwide.",
