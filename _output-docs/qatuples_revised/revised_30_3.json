    "How do I request an unlock of a DelayLocked VerusID?",
    "To request an unlock of a DelayLocked VerusID, you need to use the `setidentitytimelock` command with the `unlockatblock` option. The `unlockatblock` option specifies the block height at which the unlock should be processed. You can set `unlockatblock` to the current block height minus 1, or set it to 0 to request an unlock immediately. For example:\n\n```\njson run setidentitytimelock \"myid@\" '{ \"unlockatblock\":0 }'\n```\n\nNote that after requesting an unlock, you will need to wait for the predetermined number of blocks to pass before the identity is unlocked and the funds can be spent again.",
    "## Vault with DelayLock ![image-delaylock](/images/delaylock.png) Now let's put a DelayLock on a VerusID. This means that you lock the identity, and when you request the identity to be unlocked, a predetermined number of blocks have to pass before you can actually spend the funds again. ### Set the DelayLock Let's say you want to put a DelayLock of 1 week. 1 week is ``10,080`` blocks (1440x7). This will lock the identity, and when you request an unlock, it takes 1 week (or 10,080 blocks) before the funds can be spent again. - Under ``setunlockdelay`` you put ``10080`` - Change ``myid@`` with your own VerusID ``` json run setidentitytimelock \"myid@\" '{   \"setunlockdelay\":10080 }' ``` You can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs. :::tip Revoke & Recover Remember: you can always revoke and recover a locked VerusID. ::: ### Request an unlock Above you locked a VerusID with a DelayLock. Now let's request an unlock. When an unlock has been requested you have to wait the predetermined number of blocks before you can spend the funds again. To request an unlock you need to know the blockheight of the blockchain. Under ``unlockatblock`` you can fill in whatever the current blockheight is minus 1. So if the blockheight is at 1,000,000 you can fill in ``999999`` or just ``0`` (recommended) to immediately request an unlock. ``` json run setidentitytimelock \"myid@\" '{   \"unlockatblock\":0 }' ``` You can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs.",
