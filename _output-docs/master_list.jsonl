What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the Verus DeFi protocol, and I was wondering, how does it address the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular basket currency and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering about bridge converters in the Verus protocol. What's their purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA bridge converter is a liquidity pool that is part of defining a new blockchain. It allows for fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, and ensures smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities. The bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed basket currencies, but are bound to the launch of the new blockchain and run on the new blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been reading about the crowdfunding feature for currency and blockchain launches in Verus. Can you tell me more about how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe crowdfunding feature in Verus allows users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimum levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and pre-launch discounts for early participants.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What's the benefit of using VerusIDs in crowdfunding launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsing VerusIDs in crowdfunding launches allows for vesting schedules to be included in the pre-allocations, which provides an additional layer of flexibility and control over the launch process.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I was wondering, what's the main characteristic of the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main characteristic of the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is that it allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.", "qa_tuples": [["How does the Verus DeFi protocol address the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running?", "The Verus DeFi protocol addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular basket currency and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously.

While your funds are locked, you can still stake and receive coins. The Vault provides an additional layer of security, as the locked funds cannot be spent or moved out of the VerusID without the consent of the revocation and recovery authorities.

Anyone can participate in staking, regardless of the amount of $VRSC they have, as there are no minimum requirements to start. By staking, users can help secure the network and potentially earn rewards. Would you like to know more about staking on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. I've heard that UTXOs are staked, not balances. What's the difference between staking balances and staking UTXOs on the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn the Verus blockchain, UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) are staked, not balances. This means that a large UTXO has more chances of winning a block than a small UTXO. So, when you're staking, it's the individual UTXOs that matter, not the total balance in your wallet.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and I came across the term \"Basket currency.\" What is a \"Basket currency\" in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA \"Basket currency\" is a type of currency in Verus that has reserves and can be converted to and from those reserves. It can have one currency as its reserve or multiple currencies, up to a maximum of 10. This type of currency can be launched in a centralized or decentralized manner. Would you like to know more about how basket currencies work or is there something else on your mind?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. I was also looking at the Verus currency definition and saw an \"options\" parameter. What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"options\" parameter in Verus currency definition is used to specify various properties of the currency. It is a bitfield, which means that individual options can be combined by adding their values. For example, \"options\":33 would launch a basket currency, which is a combination of options 1 and 32. Do you have any specific questions about the options available or how to use them?\n\n**User:**\nI saw an option 2048 mentioned.

You can choose 1,2 or 3.``1`` is default, which launches a decentralized currency (no need to include this parameter when defining such a currency). When subIDs are created with this option, the registration fees are burned.``2`` is for a centralized currency. If it\u2019s a basket currency the rootID can mint and burn supply while automatically lowering and raising the reserve ratio (also anyone can burn supply without lowering the reserve ratio). Or when it\u2019s a simple token currency they can just mint and burn supply. The subID registration fees go to the rootID.``3`` is for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm a bit confused about addresses in Verus. Can you explain the two types of addresses and why it's important to understand their differences?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, there are two types of addresses: public and private. Understanding the distinctions between public and private addresses is crucial for making informed decisions about transaction privacy. Public addresses are visible on the blockchain, while private addresses are confidential and not recorded on the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. What are the different types of public addresses in Verus, and how are they derived?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are three types of public addresses in Verus: R-address, VerusID@, and i-address. An R-address is a public cryptocurrency address derived from a private key. The private key is essential for accessing and controlling the R-address. A VerusID@ is a public friendly-name cryptocurrency address controlled by a primary address, which is a R-address. An i-address is a public cryptocurrency address derived from a VerusID.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What's the main difference between public and private addresses in terms of transaction visibility?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPublic addresses and their transactions are visible on blockchain explorers because they're recorded on the public ledger. In contrast, private addresses and their transactions are confidential and do not appear on the blockchain or any explorer.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's a z-address, and how is it used for confidential exchange of funds and data?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA z-address is a private cryptocurrency address derived from a private key. The private key is essential for accessing and controlling the z-address.

What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! I'd love to learn more. What is the fundamental principle of the Verus network economy?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network economy is a decentralized economy that operates without rent-seeking profiteers or developer fees. Instead, costs for services paid to the protocol are distributed to the miners and stakers. This way, the community members who help maintain Verus are rewarded for their efforts. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that does. What are the key characteristics of the Verus mining ecosystem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus mining ecosystem is naturally decentralized, and its mining algorithm, VerusHash 2.2, is designed to equalize mining fairness across hardware classes. Additionally, no specialized mining equipment is necessary, and anyone can start mining with consumer-grade hardware. This makes it more accessible to people who want to contribute to the network.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds cool! How does Verus make it easy for starters to begin mining?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus makes it easy for starters to begin mining by allowing them to start directly from within Verus Desktop, without any additional software requirements. This streamlined process makes it easier for new miners to join the network.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of merge mining. What is it, and how does it benefit miners on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMerge mining is a feature that allows miners to mine up to 22 PBaaS-chains simultaneously, without losing any of their original hashing power. This feature will be available when PBaaS goes live on mainnet. It's a great way for miners to increase their potential earnings while supporting the network.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about staking? What are the requirements to start staking on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are no threshold requirements or registrations necessary to start staking on the Verus network. Anyone can start staking with even the smallest amount possible, such as `0.00000001 VRSC`. This low barrier to entry makes it accessible to a wider range of users.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great!

Can you explain what a basket currency is and how it's defined?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA basket currency in Verus is a type of currency that allows for the creation of a new currency by combining existing currencies. It is defined using the `definecurrency` command with `options` set to 33. The definition includes the name of the currency, the currencies that make up the basket, initial contributions to the reserves, initial supply, and preallocations. Do you have any further questions about basket currencies?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What is the purpose of the `initialcontributions` parameter when defining a basket currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `initialcontributions` parameter is used to specify the initial amounts of each currency that are contributed to the reserves of the basket currency at the time of its creation. This is required to ensure that the initial supply of the currency can be distributed to those who preconvert into the reserves. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if `initialcontributions` and/or preconversions are not specified when defining a basket currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf `initialcontributions` and/or preconversions are not specified when defining a basket currency, the initial supply of the currency will not be able to be distributed, and the currency will be bricked. It's essential to provide these parameters when creating a basket currency.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `initialsupply` parameter when defining a basket currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `initialsupply` parameter specifies the initial supply of the basket currency that is available during the preconversion time frame. People who preconvert into the reserves receive a portion of this initial supply. It's an important parameter to set when creating a basket currency.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `preallocations` parameter when defining a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `preallocations` parameter is used to specify a chosen amount of funds that will be directed to specific VerusIDs or R-addresses after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. This can be used to allocate funds to specific individuals or entities after the currency is launched.\n\n**User:**\nHow does the `preallocations` parameter affect the reserve ratio of a basket currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using the `preallocations` parameter with a basket currency, the reserve ratio of the currency is lowered after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched.

The launcher of the currency wanted to make initial contributions to its reserves. At the moment of broadcasting the currency to the network, there needed to be 210 VRSCTEST and 200 CoinCommunity in the rootID. The initial supply of 100 went to the rootID (if there weren\u2019t any more preconverters). At the same time of the launch, 100 CoinCommunity was minted into Jane@ and 50 into John@, this lowered the reserve ratio of the currency.### **\"initialsupply\"** A required parameter for basket currencies (`options:33`). This parameter does not work with simple token currencies. This is the initial supply during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People preconverting into the reserves receive from this initial supply.\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: `\"initialcontributions\"` and/or preconversions are required, otherwise the initial supply can not go anywhere and the currency is bricked.Immediately after the currency is launched, the supply can be larger due to `\"preallocations\"`.Example currency: ``` json ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{  \"name\":\"SocialBrand\",  \"options\":33, \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],  \"initialsupply\":500,  \"preallocations\":[{\"Max@\":1000}] }' ``` \u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called SocialBrand.

Funds can be directed to VerusIDs and R-addresses. Works with simple token currencies and basket currencies.When using this parameter with basket currencies, after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, the reserve ratio is lowered.

This way, users have complete control over their digital identities and assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What happens when a VerusID is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a VerusID is revoked, funds can no longer be spent from that identity. This adds an extra layer of security, as users can revoke their identity if they suspect it's been compromised.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about recovery? What happens when a VerusID is recovered?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a VerusID is recovered, all assets are recovered to a new address, and funds and UTXOs can be spent again. This ensures that users can regain access to their assets even if their identity is compromised.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about the Verus Vault. Can you explain what it is and how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Vault is a feature that allows users to create extra security for their VerusIDs by setting locks or timelocks to safeguard funds. There are three stages the Vault can be set to, and when the vault is locked, funds cannot be spent. This adds an additional layer of protection for users' assets, giving them even more control over their digital identities and assets.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about VerusIDs, the Verus Vault, or anything else related to Verus!", "qa_tuples": [["What is the purpose of assigning a `RevokeID` and a `RecoveryID` to a VerusID?", "The purpose of assigning a `RevokeID` and a `RecoveryID` to a VerusID is to allow users to have full control over their identities in a decentralized system.

How can I preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency, such as NEWCOIN, before it is active using the Verus API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency, such as NEWCOIN, before it is active using the `sendcurrency` API command. For example, to preconvert 10 VRSCTEST to NEWCOIN, you would use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{ \"address\":\"alice@\", \"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\" }]'\n```\n\nDo you have any more questions about this or would you like to ask something else?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that helps. But I do have another question. How can I convert VRSCTEST cross-chain to a PBaaS chain using the Verus API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST cross-chain to a PBaaS chain using the `sendcurrency` API command. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to PBaaSChain, you would use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{ \"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\", \"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"PBaaSChain\", \"exportto\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\", \"via\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\" }]'\n```\n\nDoes that help?

If you want to use the built-in terminal from Verus Desktop, just replace ``./verus -chain=VRSCTEST`` with ``run``.::: tip Use Verus Testnet first! \ud83d\udc77 Before launching your currency or token on Verus (or any other PBaaS-chain), it is highly recommended to try it out on testnet first. :::Let's use this example definition to launch the currency: ``` json ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{  \"name\":\"MyBrand\",  \"options\":32,  \"proofprotocol\":2,  \"preallocations\":[{\"Influencer@\":100}] }' ```", "source_filename": "./raw_text_input_docs/launch-currency.md"}
{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand more about defining a currency on Verus. Specifically, I'd like to know what the \"minpreconversion\" parameter is used for.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"minpreconversion\" parameter is used to set a minimum amount of preconversions required for a currency to launch. If the minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who preconverted will get their funds back, minus transaction and conversion fees. There is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting, which should be considered when trying to meet the minimum amount.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the \"maxpreconversion\" parameter? How does that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"maxpreconversion\" parameter is used to set a maximum amount of preconversions allowed during the preconversion time frame. If the maximum amount is exceeded, everything above it will be automatically refunded after the currency is launched. This helps to prevent excessive preconversions and maintain a healthy balance.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And what about the \"initialcontributions\" parameter? What's that used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"initialcontributions\" parameter allows the rootID to contribute some or all of the minimum preconversions directly as part of the currency definition. This parameter is used to make an initial contribution to either the reserves when it\u2019s a basket currency (`options:33`), or to the rootID when it\u2019s a simple token currency (`options:32`). The funds to initially contribute need to be in the rootID when defining the currency. After the preconversion time frame is over and the currency launched, the rootID has received an amount of the launched currency.

The minimum amount of preconversions needs to be met or the currency will not launch and everyone gets their conversions returned, minus the transaction and conversion fees. It works both with basket currencies and simple token currencies.There is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting. Take this into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.Example currency: ``` json ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{  \"name\":\"CompanyX\",  \"options\":32,  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],  \"conversions\":[2],  \"minpreconversion\":[500] }' ``` \u261d\ufe0f This simple token currency is called CompanyX. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert at least 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 250 CompanyX, or more when more is converted. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds back.### **\"maxpreconversion\"** Use this parameter to set a maximum amount of preconversions. During the preconversion time frame the amount set can not be exceeded. Everything above this amount will be automatically refunded after the currency is launched.Example currency: ``` json ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{  \"name\":\"CoinCommunity\",  \"options\":33,  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],  \"maxpreconversion\":[100],  \"initialsupply\":100 }' ``` \u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called CoinCommunity. During the preconversion time frame people can convert VRSCTEST into its reserves for 100 CoinCommunity in return. During the preconversion time frame there can not be more than 100 VRSCTEST converted into its reserves. Whatever is preconverted more will be returned.### **\"initialcontributions\"** The rootID can contribute some or all of the minimum preconversions directly as part of the currency definition.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you may have about Verus DeFi. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the fees for conversions in Verus DeFi. What are the conversion fees for basket currency conversions and reserve conversions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe conversion fees for basket currency conversions are 0.025%, with 0.0125% going to the reserves of the basket currency and 0.0125% to the block reward for miners and stakers. For reserve conversions, the fee is 0.05%, with 0.025% going to the reserves of the basket currency and 0.025% to the block reward for miners and stakers. Do you have any further questions about these fees or Verus DeFi in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I was wondering about MEV and front-running attacks. Does Verus DeFi's conversion mechanism have any benefits in terms of MEV and front-running attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi's conversion mechanism is MEV-free, meaning it does not allow for front-running, back-running, or sandwich attacks, because all currency conversions are solved simultaneously inside a block, giving all participants the same price. This design provides a significant benefit in terms of security and fairness for users. Do you have any more questions about this topic or Verus DeFi?\n\n**User:**\nWhat are basket currencies in Verus DeFi, and what opportunities do they offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBasket currencies are unique currencies that can be created on the Verus network, which can have multiple reserves. They offer an enormous amount of opportunities for value creation, as every currency and token on the Verus network, including mapped ERC-20s, can be used as reserves. This allows for a high degree of customization and flexibility in creating novel financial instruments. Do you have any more questions about basket currencies or Verus DeFi?\n\n**User:**\nWhat about simple token currencies in Verus DeFi? What are they, and what are their characteristics?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSimple token currencies are currencies without any reserves. They can support a lot of use cases, especially with the ability to add parameters, create subIDs, and use decentralized crowdfund mechanisms. The supply of decentralized simple token currencies is static, while centralized ones can be minted by the owner of the rootID and burned by anyone. Simple token currencies provide a straightforward way to create and manage tokens on the Verus network. Do you have any more questions about simple token currencies or Verus DeFi?\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I was curious about the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. How does it work, and what benefits does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus-Ethereum Bridge is a non-custodial bridge that allows currencies and tokens to be sent between Verus and Ethereum. It is a true non-custodial bridge, meaning that all tokens and currencies flowing over the bridge are never in anyone's custody, and are proven and verified by consensus rules. This allows for seamless interaction between the two networks. The bridge offers a secure and trustless way to move assets between Verus and Ethereum, unlocking new possibilities for DeFi applications.

The protocol doesn\u2019t have any of the problems EVM-like account-based systems have. Verus DeFi is fair, cheap and has no rent-seekers.Every(!) currency and token on the Verus network (also mapped ERC-20s!), can be used as reserves for basket currencies. As you might start to understand now \u2014 basket currencies are unique currencies that can not be found anywhere else and offer an enormous amount of opportunities for value creation.## Simple token currencies Simple token currencies and are just currencies without any reserves. They are not as exciting as the basket currencies, yet still offer much value. With all the parameters that can be added, subIDs created and decentralized crowdfund mechanisms, these currencies can support a lot of use cases that are difficult to do with alternative protocols.The supply of this type of currency is static when it\u2019s a decentralized version. When it\u2019s a centralized version, the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn them.This option is also used to create currencies that are mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s. Which means you can send those ERC-20s over to Verus, or from Verus to the ERC-20. This is made possible with the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge. You can read more about it here.And of course, a simple token currency can be one of the reserves in a basket currency.## Ethereum ERC-20 The Verus-Ethereum Bridge makes it possible for currencies and tokens to be send over to Ethereum, and back to Verus.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the recommended absolute limit for all currency supplies, including conversions and extended tail emissions for blockchains.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe recommended absolute limit for all currency supplies, including conversions and extended tail emissions for blockchains, is 10 billion (minus 1 satoshi) with 8 decimal places, which is 9999999999.99999999. This is a general guideline to ensure that your currency supply doesn't get too large and unwieldy.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful! I've also been curious about \"prelaunchcarveout\" when defining a currency. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n\"prelaunchcarveout\" is used to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the rootID after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, which lowers the reserve ratio, making the currency more volatile. It's a way to adjust the reserve ratio of your currency after launch.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. How do I actually use \"prelaunchcarveout\" when defining a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use \"prelaunchcarveout\" when defining a currency by including it as a property in the JSON object passed to the `definecurrency` command.

What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n\"prelaunchdiscount\" is used to give people a discount during the preconversion time frame, and after the currency is launched, the conversion price will be higher, depending on what percentage the discount was. It's a way to incentivize early adopters of your currency.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how do I use \"prelaunchdiscount\" when defining a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use \"prelaunchdiscount\" when defining a currency by including it as a property in the JSON object passed to the `definecurrency` command.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been looking into blockchains launched using Verus. What are the key features of those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBlockchains launched using Verus have several key features, including: full interoperability with other Verus-based blockchains, customizability to suit specific use cases, independence from other blockchains, and L1 features such as multi-currency support, DeFi capabilities, self-sovereign identities, privacy technology, and high performance. Does that help clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nThat does, thanks. One of those features stood out to me - L1 Multi-currency. What is that, and what features does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nL1 Multi-currency is a feature of Verus-based blockchains that allows for the creation of consensus layer basket currencies (e.g., liquidity pools) and simple token currencies. It also enables decentralized crowdfund mechanisms. This feature gives a lot of flexibility to the users of your blockchain. Do you have any further questions about L1 Multi-currency?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. Another feature I saw was L1 DeFi. What is that, and what benefits does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nL1 DeFi is a feature of Verus-based blockchains that offers consensus layer Automated Market Makers (AMMs), which are MEV-free (i.e., they do not allow front-running or back-running). This feature solves all conversions simultaneously within a block and provides a fully decentralized marketplace. The benefit here is that you get a decentralized marketplace that is resistant to certain types of market manipulation. Do you have any further questions about L1 DeFi?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's clear. What about L1 VerusID? What features does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nL1 VerusID is a feature of Verus-based blockchains that offers consensus layer self-sovereign identities. It provides a namespace for currencies, tokens, and PBaaS-blockchains, as well as friendly-name addresses. VerusIDs are revocable, recoverable, and can be bound to any type of data, including NFTs and profiles. This feature gives users a lot of control over their digital identity. Do you have any further questions about L1 VerusID?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. I've been thinking about launching a PBaaS-chain using Verus. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a PBaaS-chain using Verus, you need to have a VerusID and 10,000 VRSC, which will be split between the Verus block producers and the block producers of the newly launched chain. No programming is required, and you can create your own token currency or full-fledged blockchain with DeFi capabilities. It's a relatively straightforward process, and the Verus community is here to help.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the benefit of launching a PBaaS-chain using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe benefit of launching a PBaaS-chain using Verus is that you get a complete, multi-currency, VerusID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. Additionally, you can join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon, which will help improve your blockchain. You essentially get a fully-fledged blockchain with a lot of features and a community backing it.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question - what are DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets allow any VerusID owner to define basket currencies with one or more reserves backing the currency, at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. This enables the creation of customized currencies with flexible reserve requirements. It's a very powerful feature that gives users a lot of control over their currencies.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been looking into the technology behind Verus, and I'm curious about Verus Proof of Power (VerusPoP). What is it, and how does it validate blocks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Proof of Power (VerusPoP) is a hybrid consensus algorithm that combines Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate each block. It uses a statistical function to determine whether a block is validated by PoW or PoS, with a target percentage of 50% of blocks validated by each form of proof. This means that 50% of all blocks are validated by miners (PoW) and the other 50% are validated by stakers (PoS).\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What makes VerusPoP resistant to attacks, and what would an attacker need to successfully attack the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusPoP is resistant to attacks because it requires more than 50% of the validation power, known as \"Chain Power\", to successfully attack the Verus blockchain. This means that an attacker would need to control over 50% of both the chain's hashpower and its coin supply, making it a highly secure and decentralized network.\n\n**User:**\nI see. How does VerusPoP incentivize holders to support the network, and what happens to the PoW/PoS ratio if there is a change in network hashrate?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusPoP provides a decentralizing effect on the network by incentivizing holders to keep nodes online to support the network. Even if there is a change in network hashrate, the PoW/PoS ratio remains the same, at 50/50%. This ensures that the network remains balanced and secure.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. What makes it secure, and how does it prevent assets from being in anyone's custody?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus-Ethereum Bridge is secure because it utilizes the cooperation of block producers (worldwide miners and stakers), community notary witnesses, the Bridgekeeper software, and the Ethereum smart contract. At each step during cross-chain transactions, the assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent hacks. This ensures that assets are never in anyone's custody, and the bridge remains secure.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. Can you tell me more about notarizations in the context of the Verus-Ethereum Bridge?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotarizations are digital receipts created by block producers every 10 blocks when there is traffic over the bridge.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHi! I'm trying to understand how to define a PBaaS blockchain. Specifically, what's the purpose of the `options` parameter, and how do I use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `options` parameter is used to customize the behavior of your PBaaS blockchain by combining various options. These options define different use cases for your blockchain, such as allowing fractional reserve conversions, enabling ID staking, or setting up a token-based system. You can combine these options by adding their corresponding values together in the `options` parameter. Does that make sense? Do you have any specific options you're interested in using?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually, I was wondering about the `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` option. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` option allows reserve conversions using base calculations when set. This means that your blockchain will support fractional reserve conversions, which can be useful in certain use cases. Do you think you'll need fractional reserve conversions in your blockchain?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that helps. Now, how do I create a blockchain of a specific name using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a blockchain of a specific name, you need a VerusID of the same name.

Make sure you have the necessary VerusID before trying to create the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! One last question: what's the recommended limit for currency supplies in a Verus blockchain, and why is it important to follow this limit?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe recommended limit for currency supplies in a Verus blockchain is 10 billion (with 8 decimal places: 9999999999.99999999). This limit is important to follow because it prevents potential issues with conversions and extended tail emissions over time.

The converted VRSC goes into the rootID.People can preconvert to this currency within the preconversion time frame. Define a `\"startblock\"`, or let the default and minimum time frame play out, which is 20 blocks.Example currency: ``` json ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{  \"name\":\"CoolBrand\",  \"options\":32,  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],  \"conversions\":[0.1],  \"minpreconversion\":[1000] }' ``` \u261d\ufe0f This simple token currency is called CoolBrand. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 1000 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 10.000 CoolBrand. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds back.", "source_filename": "./raw_text_input_docs/launch-currency.md"}

What does that mean in the context of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA \"fair launch\" in the context of Verus means that everyone has equal opportunity to collect its currency through mining and staking. This is characterized by the absence of a few key things. Firstly, there was no ICO (Initial Coin Offering), so no funds were raised through that means. Secondly, there are no founder or developer fees or taxes imposed on the network. Thirdly, there was no pre-mine, where coins were allocated to specific individuals or groups before the launch. Fourthly, commercial interests were not prioritized over the community.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHi! I've been looking into VerusPay and I have a few questions about it. What's the purpose of the `VERUSPAY_VALID` flag in a VerusPay invoice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `VERUSPAY_VALID` flag (value: 1) indicates that the invoice is valid and can be processed. This flag must be set for the invoice to be considered actionable. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about VerusPay invoices?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What does the `VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_CONVERSION` flag allow in a VerusPay invoice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_CONVERSION` flag (value: 2) specifies that the invoice accepts currency conversions. This allows payments in different currencies, with conversion to the invoice's requested currency. If an invoice accepts conversion, it requires a max estimated slippage value. Do you have any more questions about this flag or VerusPay in general?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. What about the `VERUSPAY_EXPIRES` flag? What's its purpose in a VerusPay invoice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `VERUSPAY_EXPIRES` flag (value: 8) determines that the invoice has an expiry condition. If set, the invoice must be paid before a specific Verus blockchain height is reached, and an expiry height must be set. Does that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nYes, thank you! What does the `VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_ANY_DESTINATION` flag allow in a VerusPay invoice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_ANY_DESTINATION` flag (value: 16) allows the invoice to accept payments to any destination. If set, the destination field in the invoice must be left blank. Do you have any more questions about VerusPay flags or invoices?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I was wondering about something a bit more general. Why is serialization and deserialization important in VerusPay invoices?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSerialization and deserialization are important in VerusPay invoices because they enable a standardized approach to converting the VerusPay Invoice and VerusPay InvoiceDetails into a binary format (serialization) and back (deserialization) to ensure efficient transmission and storage. This process ensures that invoices can be shared, processed, and stored across different systems and languages without loss of fidelity or meaning.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about locking and unlocking VerusIDs. What are the outcomes of locking a VerusID until a certain number of blocks, locking a VerusID with a delay, and unlocking a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe outcomes of locking a VerusID are as follows:\n\n* Locked until x blocks: Funds cannot be spent until a predetermined number of blocks have passed.\n* Locked with delay: Funds cannot be spent until an unlock has been requested and a predetermined number of blocks have passed.\n* Unlocked: Funds can be spent.\n\nIs that clear? Do you have any further questions about locking and unlocking VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually. Can a locked or timelocked VerusID still receive, hold, and stake funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, a locked or timelocked VerusID can still receive, hold, and stake funds. Additionally, it can still be used for signing. The lock or timelock only affects spending, not receiving or staking.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if someone gains access to the private keys of a locked VerusID that has been set up with a delay using Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf someone gains access to the private keys of a locked VerusID that has been set up with a delay using Verus Vault, they will have to unlock the identity in order to spend the funds. The unlock request will trigger a warning, and the intruder will have to wait for the delay period (e.g., 10,080 blocks) before they can spend the funds. This gives the owner time to safeguard their funds away from the intruder.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What is an example use case for Verus Vault in the context of safe staking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne example use case for Verus Vault is safe staking. You can put funds to stake on a VerusID and use Vault to lock the identity with a delay of 10,080 blocks (~1 week). This way, if someone gains access to the private keys of the locked VerusID, they will have to unlock the identity and wait for the delay period before they can spend the funds, giving you time to respond and protect your funds.\n\n**User:**\nCan a VerusID be revoked and recovered even when it is locked or timelocked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, a VerusID can still be revoked and recovered even when it is locked or timelocked.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the VerusID Marketplace protocol, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusID Marketplace protocol is a decentralized protocol that allows anyone to buy and sell VerusIDs.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been exploring Verus and I'm curious about currencies. What is a basket currency in Verus, and how is it defined?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA basket currency in Verus is a type of currency that holds reserves of other currencies. It is defined using the `definecurrency` command, specifying the currencies that can be converted into its reserves, along with their respective weights. The weights determine the proportion of each currency that makes up the basket currency. Do you have any further questions about basket currencies or currencies in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What is the purpose of the `startblock` parameter when defining a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `startblock` parameter specifies the block height at which the currency should be launched. There is a 20-block preconversion time frame before the currency is launched, during which various currencies can be converted into its reserves. If `startblock` is omitted, the currency will launch 20 blocks after the `definecurrency` command is broadcast to the network. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about currency definition?\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens when the `endblock` is reached for a centralized currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the `endblock` is reached for a centralized currency (i.e., a currency with `proofprotocol:2`), the currency is converted into a decentralized one, meaning that no further minting or burning of tokens is possible. Does that answer your question? Do you have any more questions about centralized currencies or decentralization?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `idregistrationfees` parameter when defining a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `idregistrationfees` parameter sets the cost of registering subIDs under the rootID of a currency. The default registration fee is 100 units of the currency. If the currency is decentralized, the fees are burned, reducing the supply of the currency and increasing its value. If the currency is centralized, the fees go to the rootID. Do you have any more questions about ID registration or currency fees?\n\n**User:**\nHow do initial contributions work when defining a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nInitial contributions are funds added to a currency's reserves at the time of its launch. They are specified using the `initialcontributions` parameter when defining the currency. The funds must be present in the rootID at the time of launch, and are used to initialize the currency's reserves. Does that make sense?

During the preconversion time frame there are various currencies that can be converted into its reserves. They have different weights to them. 0.5 for VRSCTEST, 0.25 for both BusinessBrand and DiscountBrand.### **\"startblock\"** Use this parameter to define the block height when the currency should be launched.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the `sendcurrency` command when bridging from Verus to Ethereum. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` command is used to estimate the bridging costs from Verus to Ethereum. It allows you to calculate the gas fees required to use the smart contract on the Ethereum side. Do you have any further questions about this command or the bridging process?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How can I estimate the bridging costs from Verus to Ethereum using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can estimate the bridging costs from Verus to Ethereum using the following command:\n```\njson run sendcurrency \"*\" '[{ \"currency\":\"veth\", \"exportto\":\"veth\", \"address\":\"0x71518580f36FeCEFfE0721F06bA4703218cD7F63\", \"amount\":1, \"refundto\":\"john doe@\" }]' 1 0.0001 1\n```\nNote that the `1` at the end of the command is important, as it specifies that you want to estimate the costs, not actually send the amount. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat looks a bit complicated. What information do I need to provide when using the `sendcurrency` command to estimate bridging costs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using the `sendcurrency` command to estimate bridging costs, you need to provide the following information:\n\n* `currency`: The type of currency being bridged (e.g. `veth`)\n* `exportto`: The destination chain (e.g. `veth`)\n* `address`: The Ethereum address receiving the bridged assets\n* `amount`: The amount of currency being bridged (set to `1` to estimate costs)\n* `refundto`: The Verus address to refund to in case of failure\n\nMake sure to fill in the correct information, and you'll get an estimate of the bridging costs. Do you have any more questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nHow long does the bridging process from Verus to Ethereum typically take?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe bridging process from Verus to Ethereum can take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes. It's a relatively quick process, considering the complexity of bridging between two different blockchain networks.\n\n**User:**\nAnd finally, what are the different ways to bridge from Verus to Ethereum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are three ways to bridge from Verus to Ethereum:\n\n1.

What are the advantages of converting currencies using Bridge.vETH or other basket currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nConverting currencies using Bridge.vETH or other basket currencies has several advantages. It is MEV-resistant, which means it is resistant to miner extractable value attacks. Additionally, it has no smart contract risks due to protocol-level security, and it has low fees, capped at 0.05%.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI have some questions about transactions on Verus. What information is visible in a public-to-private transaction, where the sender is a public address and the recipient is a private address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn a public-to-private transaction, the sender's address and the amount sent are visible, while the recipient's address(es) and received amount(s) are not visible. So, the recipient's information remains private.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But is it possible to correlate transactions and potentially link two public addresses based on transaction patterns in a public-to-private transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, it is still possible to correlate transactions by time and amounts between public and private addresses, potentially linking two public addresses based on transaction patterns.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about launching currencies on Verus. What are the advantages of launching currencies on Verus compared to EVM-like protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLaunching currencies on Verus has several advantages compared to EVM-like protocols. It is better, faster, cheaper, and more secure. Additionally, there is no coding involved. Would you like to know more about the different types of currencies that can be launched with the Verus Protocol?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that sounds interesting. What are the two types of currencies that can be launched with the Verus Protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe two types of currencies that can be launched with the Verus Protocol are basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools) and simple token currencies. Both types can be issued in a decentralized or centralized manner with minting and burning capabilities. You might also be interested in learning more about subIDs, which are similar to VerusIDs but with some key differences.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is a subID, and how does it differ from a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA subID is a powerful object on Verus (and other PBaaS-blockchains) that is similar to a VerusID, but with one key difference: subIDs cannot launch blockchains or currencies.

Would you like to know more about how they function and their key characteristics?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I'd love to learn more about basket currencies.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBasket currencies function like automated market makers (AMMs) and have reserves. They can have between 1 and 10 currencies in their reserves. The basket currency supply is dynamic, depending on conversions to and from the basket currency. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to its reserves and the reserve ratio. The reserve ratio can be set to any value between 0% and 100%, affecting the currency's volatility.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What happens when a centralized version of a basket currency is created, and how does it affect the reserve ratio?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a centralized version of a basket currency is created, the owner of the rootID can mint currencies into existence, automatically lowering the reserve ratio. Alternatively, they can burn currencies and automatically raise the reserve ratio. Anyone can also burn the currency at will without raising the reserve ratio.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about conversion fees for basket currencies? How do they work, and where do they go?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe conversion fees for basket currencies are 0.025% when converting to and from a basket currency, and 0.05% when converting from reserve to reserve currency.

A reserve can be any currency or token on the Verus network (also bridged). Have a look at the simplified image. If anyone has currency X or Y, they can convert to the basket currency, or convert from reserve to reserve. If anyone has the basket currency, they can go to currency X or Y. A basket currency can have 1 and up to 10 currencies in its reserves.The basket currency supply is dynamic, depending on how much is converted to the basket currency (supply minted), or back to its reserve(s) (supply burned).A basket currency can be 100% backed by its reserves, 5%, or anything in between. This is called the reserve ratio, or the weight. The lower the reserve ratio, the more volatile the currency is when people are converting into or out of the basket currency. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to what is in the reserves and what the reserve ratio is.When a centralized version of this currency is created, the owner of the rootID can mint currencies into existence, while automatically lowering the reserve ratio. Or they can burn currencies and automatically raise the reserve ratio. Anyone can also just burn the currency at will without raising the reserve ratio.The conversion fees are incredibly low, 0.025% when converting to and from a basket currency, and 0.05% when converting from reserve to reserve currency.
