# Staking 

Staking is accessible for everyone. Use Verus holdings to secure the network. It does not matter how much $VRSC you have, there are no minimum requirements to start staking. 

On the Verus blockchain UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) are staking, not balances. A large UTXO has more chances of winning a block than a small UTXO. [What is a UTXO?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0UYZ9hDos)

## Solo staking
There are a few rules you need to know before you can start staking.

| Rules | 
| :-----|
| Wallet Running | 
| Full Node Required (native mode in Verus Desktop) | 
| Staking Enabled | 
| UTXO Eligible After 150 Blocks | 
| Minimum of 0.00000001 VRSC in Wallet |

With solo staking you either win a full block or you win nothing.

## Pool staking
There are two ways to do pool staking with Verus. One is keeping control over your funds in combination with VerusID, the other is sending your coins to a pool operator and trusting your funds with them.
