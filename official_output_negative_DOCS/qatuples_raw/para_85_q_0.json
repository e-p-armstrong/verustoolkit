    "How do I permanently lock my VerusID without the possibility of recovery or revocation?",
    "You can't. VerusIDs can always be revoked and recovered, even if they've been locked with a DelayLock. This is a feature of the VerusID system, designed to provide an additional layer of security and control over your identity.",
    "``` json\nrun updateidentity \n'{ \n  \"name\":\"youridentityname\",\n  \"minimumsignatures\":1,\n  \"primaryaddresses\":[\"primary-address-comes-here\"],\n  \"flags\":2,\n  \"timelock\":10080\n  }'\n```\n\nYou can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs. In the code snippet are the minimum requirements to update your VerusID with a lock.\n\n:::tip Revoke & Recover\nRemember: you can always revoke and recover a locked VerusID.\n:::\n\n### Request an unlock\nAbove you locked a VerusID with a DelayLock. Now let's request an unlock. When an unlock has been requested you have to wait the predetermined number of blocks before you can spend the funds again.\n\nFill in your VerusID ``name``, the ``primary address`` and set ``flags`` to 0. Now you only have to wait for your predetermined number of blocks (10,080 in our example) to run out so you can spend the funds again.\n\n``` json\nrun updateidentity \n'{ \n  \"name\":\"youridentityname\",\n  \"minimumsignatures\":1,\n  \"primaryaddresses\":[\"primary-address-comes-here\"],\n  \"flags\":0\n  }'\n```\n\nYou can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs.
