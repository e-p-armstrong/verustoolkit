    "How do I launch a currency without paying the currency fee and initial contribution?",
    "You can't launch a currency without paying the currency fee and initial contribution. The text explicitly states that you need to have enough funds in the rootID for the currency fee (200.0002 VRSC) and the initial contribution.",

The community is happy to assist!](https://www.verus.io/discord)\n:::\n\n## How to launch\nNow you know how to create a currency definition with all its options and parameters. Next up: how to actually use the definition to launch a currency.\n\nHere we use the command-line interface. If you want to use the built-in terminal from Verus Desktop, just replace ``./verus -chain=VRSCTEST`` with ``run``.\n\n::: tip Use Verus Testnet first! \ud83d\udc77\nBefore launching your currency or token on Verus (or any other PBaaS-chain), it is highly recommended to try it out on testnet first. \n:::\n\nLet's use this example definition to launch the currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"MyBrand\",\n \"options\":32, \n \"proofprotocol\":2, \n \"preallocations\":[{\"Influencer@\":100}]\n}'\n```\n\nEntering the above command into the command-line interface wallet gives a `HEX` value as output. Take that HEX and do the following command below. \u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: make sure there are enough funds in the rootID for the currency fee (200.0002 VRSC) and the initial contribution (when in parameters).\n\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction \"HEX\"\n```\n\nAfter doing the command above the currency has started, the funds from the rootID are taken, and it takes a minimum of 20 blocks (or startblock) to actually launch it (and if all preconversion goals are met).\n\nDuring the preconversion time frame and after the launch you can lookup all kinds of information on the currency with the following command:\n\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency \"MyBrand\"\n```",
