    "Why is it necessary to include the 20-byte VDXF key when serializing a VerusPay Invoice to create a deeplink or QR code?",
    "Actually, the 20-byte VDXF key should not be included when serializing a VerusPay Invoice to create a deeplink or QR code. According to the specification, the invoice must be serialized without its 20-byte VDXF key included, and then its bytes formatted into a base64url string.",
    "The specification emphasizes a standardized approach to converting the VerusPay Invoice and VerusPay InvoiceDetails into a binary format (serialization) and back (deserialization) to enable efficient transmission and storage. This process ensures that invoices can be shared, processed, and stored across different systems and languages without loss of fidelity or meaning.\n\n### Packaging into Deeplinks and QR Codes\n\nTo package a VerusPay Invoice into a deeplink or QR code readable by wallets like [Verus Mobile](https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Mobile), the invoice must be serialized using the method described above, without its 20-byte [VDXF](/vdxf/) key included, and then its bytes formatted into a base64url string. Then, a deeplink URL can be created as follows:\n\n```[vrsc::applications.wallet VDXF ID]://x-callback-url/[veruspay.vrsc::invoice VDXF ID]/[VerusPay invoice bytes in base64url format]```\n\nIn practice, this creates URLs such as `i5jtwbp6zymeay9llnraglgjqgdrffsau4://x-callback-url/iEETy7La3FTN2Sd2hNRgepek5S8x8eeUeQ/AzABpJ-uxwACFAAtMxHDi_0hkJLSrvRJgEvos77-pu-eojVjXjKBJP80KdufnpG2Ti0`, which can then be packaged into a QR code and scanned by a VerusPay supporting wallet application, or linked to by an application or service to trigger an invoice request.",
