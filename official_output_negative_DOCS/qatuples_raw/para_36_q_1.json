    "What is the main advantage of the EVM-like account-based systems over Verus DeFi?",
    "There is no mention of EVM-like account-based systems being superior to Verus DeFi in the provided text. In fact, the text states that Verus DeFi doesn't have the problems that EVM-like account-based systems have, and that Verus DeFi is fair, cheap, and has no rent-seekers.",
    "When a centralized version of this currency is created, the owner of the rootID can mint currencies into existence, while automatically lowering the reserve ratio. Or they can burn currencies and automatically raise the reserve ratio. Anyone can also just burn the currency at will without raising the reserve ratio.The conversion fees are incredibly low, 0.025% when converting to and from a basket currency, and 0.05% when converting from reserve to reserve currency. These fees go directly to the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, and/or they are accrued into the reserves making the basket currency worth more.| Conversion type | Fee | Fee goes to |\n| :-----| :------ | :-------- |\n| Basket currency \u2194\ufe0f reserve | 0.025% | 0.0125% added to reserves of the basket currency, 0.0125% to the block reward for miners and stakers | \n| Reserve \u2194\ufe0f reserve | 0.05% | 0.025% added to reserves of the basket currency, 0.025% to the block reward for miners and stakers |Because all currency conversions are solved simultaneously inside a block, giving all participants the same price, the protocol is MEV-free (no front-running, back-running, sandwich attacks etc.). The protocol doesn\u2019t have any of the problems EVM-like account-based systems have. Verus DeFi is fair, cheap and has no rent-seekers.Every(!) currency and token on the Verus network (also mapped ERC-20s!), can be used as reserves for basket currencies. As you might start to understand now \u2014 basket currencies are unique currencies that can not be found anywhere else and offer an enormous amount of opportunities for value creation.",
