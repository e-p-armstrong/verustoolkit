    "How do I get regular rewards with solo mining?",
    "You can't. According to the quick comparison table, solo mining does not provide regular rewards. If you want regular rewards, you would need to participate in pool mining. Solo mining only provides full block rewards, but it may take a while before winning a block, depending on your hashrate.",
