    "What is the minimum amount of Verus coins that I need to stake in order to participate in the network and earn rewards?",
    "There is no minimum requirement for staking Verus coins. Anyone can stake Verus coins without any minimum amount or locking of funds. This makes it accessible to everyone and ensures that the network is decentralized and community-driven.",
    "## Decentralized & community-built\nVerus is a decentralized public blockchain, a community driven project in the true spirit of Bitcoin. Anyone can participate and contribute, no matter who you are or where you come from. Verus is:\n* **Open**\n* **Borderless**\n* **Public**\n* **Neutral**\n* **Censorship resistant**\n\nAnyone can start mining and staking the Verus Protocol. Mobile phones and ARMs (e.g. Orange Pi 5) are the most energy efficient devices to mine Verus (and 22 other PBaaS-chains) with. To stake there are no minimum requirements or locking of funds.\n\nThere is no company behind Verus, it is community-built. All protocol fees go to the block producers of the network (the miners and stakers).\n\nThese characteristics that anyone can participate in the Verus Protocol makes it one of the most decentralized networks worldwide.\n\n## Fair launch\nVerus had a fair launch, meaning that everyone had, and still has equal opportunity to collect its currency through mining and staking. For Verus this means:\n* **No ICO has been held**\n* **No founder or developer fees/tax**\n* **No premine**\n* **No commercial interests**\n* **No rent-seeking behavior**\n\nThe launch of the Verus blockchain was announced on the Bitcointalk.org forum [See post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4070404.0) 15 minutes before the first block could be mined.\n\n::: tip Rich List\n[Take a look at the richlist to see coin distribution.](https://dexstats.info/richlist.php?asset=VRSC) \n:::",
