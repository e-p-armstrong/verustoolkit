    "Are decentralized simple token currencies on Verus dynamic in terms of supply?",
    "No, decentralized simple token currencies on Verus have a static supply. It's only the centralized version of these currencies where the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn them.",
    "## Simple token currencies\nSimple token currencies and are just currencies without any reserves. They are not as exciting as the basket currencies, yet still offer much value. With all the parameters that can be added, subIDs created and decentralized crowdfund mechanisms, these currencies can support a lot of use cases that are difficult to do with alternative protocols.The supply of this type of currency is static when it\u2019s a decentralized version. When it\u2019s a centralized version, the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn them.This option is also used to create currencies that are mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s. Which means you can send those ERC-20s over to Verus, or from Verus to the ERC-20. This is made possible with the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge. You can read more about it here.And of course, a simple token currency can be one of the reserves in a basket currency.## Ethereum ERC-20 \nThe Verus-Ethereum Bridge makes it possible for currencies and tokens to be send over to Ethereum, and back to Verus. It is a true non-custodial bridge. All tokens and currencies flowing over the bridge are never in anyone\u2019s custody, and are proven and verified by consensus rules. [Everything on the Verus-Ethereum Bridge here.](/eth-bridge/)Any currency and token, on Verus or any other PBaaS-blockchain, can be exported to Ethereum as an ERC-20. They can then be used in the Ethereum ecosystem.Also, any already existing ERC-20 token can be mapped one-to-one as a Verus currency. Meaning any ERC-20 token can live on the Verus blockchain (or any other PBaaS-chain) and take advantage of all the L1 features.",
