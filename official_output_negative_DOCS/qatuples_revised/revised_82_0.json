    "What happens to the fees generated by the protocol if they are not collected in the fee pool?",
    "The fees generated by the protocol are indeed collected in the fee pool. There is no scenario where fees are not collected in the fee pool. According to the protocol's design, all fees are collected in the fee pool, and with each new block, 1% of the fee pool is added on top of the block rewards.",
    "## Fee Pool\nAll the fees generated by the protocol are collected in the ``fee pool``. With each new block, ``1%`` of the fee pool is added on top of the block rewards. It is expected that fees outnumber block rewards, making mining and staking in the Verus ecosystem a profitable and competitive endeavor.",
