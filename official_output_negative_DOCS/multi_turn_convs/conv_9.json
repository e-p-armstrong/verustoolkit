    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got another question about VerusIDs. Are they only defined on the Verus network and not on any other blockchain or system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not limited to being defined only on the Verus network. They can also exist on independent PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) blockchains, which are spawned from and registered on the Verus blockchain network, as well as on fully external systems that may have been created without any registration on the Verus network initially. So, VerusIDs can be used in a variety of contexts beyond just the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I was wondering, do VerusIDs require compatibility of their internal structure across different systems for recognition on the Verus blockchain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the VDXF does not require compatibility of the internal structure of IDs across different systems. It only defines compatibility requirements for the naming systems and how those names translate into recognizable IDs on the Verus network. So, the internal structure of the IDs can vary, but the naming system and translation to IDs on the Verus network need to be compatible.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. One more question. Is a VDXF object a human-readable format that can only be interpreted by systems specifically designed for it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a VDXF object is a serialized byte array that can be written to or interpreted by any system, given the appropriate libraries for handling its format. This means that it is a machine-readable format, not a human-readable format, and can be used by any system that has the necessary libraries to deserialize the byte stream and reconstruct the original structured data.",
