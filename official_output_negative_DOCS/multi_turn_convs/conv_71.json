    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm looking into staking with Verus, but I have some questions. What's the main difference between solo staking and pool staking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main difference is not that pool staking is more secure, but rather that with solo staking, you either win a full block or you win nothing, whereas with pool staking, the rewards are shared among the pool participants. Additionally, with pool staking, you can choose to keep control over your funds using VerusID or trust your funds with a pool operator. Do you have any other questions about staking or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. I was also wondering, is there a minimum amount of $VRSC required to start staking with Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is no minimum amount of $VRSC required to start staking with Verus. However, your UTXO must be eligible, which means it must be at least 150 blocks old, and you must have at least 0.00000001 VRSC in your wallet. It's worth noting that the more VRSC you have, the higher your chances of winning a block, but there's no specific minimum threshold to get started.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, that makes sense. One more question: can I start staking with Verus without running a full node?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot start staking with Verus without running a full node. One of the rules for solo staking is that a full node is required, which can be achieved by running Verus Desktop in native mode. This is necessary to ensure that you have a complete copy of the blockchain and can validate transactions. Do you have any other questions about staking or Verus?",
