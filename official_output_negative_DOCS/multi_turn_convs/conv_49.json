    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've got a question about using the Verus wallet to interact with the blockchain. How do I use the Verus Desktop wallet to interact with the blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some confusion. You shouldn't use the Verus Desktop wallet to interact with the blockchain. Instead, you should use the Verus CLI (command-line-interface) wallet. You can interact with the blockchain by running the `verus` command in the terminal, after extracting the packaged file and going into the directory where you extracted verus-cli.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, thanks for the clarification. I've got another question. What is the purpose of the `fetch-params` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `fetch-params` command is used to download the zcash parameters needed to get started, and it's recommended to run it before using `verusd` when setting up a new system.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks! And one more question. Can I start the Verus blockchain by running the `verus` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, to start the Verus blockchain, you need to run the `verusd` command, not the `verus` command. The `verusd` command starts the blockchain, while the `verus` command is used to interact with the blockchain.",
