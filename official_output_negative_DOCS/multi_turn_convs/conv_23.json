    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to set up a new blockchain on Verus, but I'm having some trouble. How do I launch a blockchain without setting up a `notaries` field in the currency definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to help! Unfortunately, it's not possible to launch a blockchain without setting up a `notaries` field in the currency definition. The `notaries` field is a required field, as it specifies the list of notaries that will be responsible for confirming transactions on the blockchain.\n\nFor example, you might set the `notaries` field to `[\"allnotary1@\", \"allnotary2@\", \"allnotary3@\"]`, which means that these three notaries will be responsible for confirming transactions on the blockchain.\n\nWithout the `notaries` field, your blockchain won't be able to function properly, as there won't be any nodes to confirm transactions. So, you'll need to make sure to include this field in your currency definition. If you have any questions about how to set it up, I'd be happy to help!",
