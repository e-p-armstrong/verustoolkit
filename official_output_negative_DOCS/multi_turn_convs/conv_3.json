    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about currencies. How do I define a currency with a custom preconversion time frame of 10 blocks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to define a currency with a custom preconversion time frame of 10 blocks. The preconversion time frame is always 20 blocks and cannot be less than that. So, you'll need to stick with the default 20-block preconversion time frame.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What about setting an \"endblock\" parameter on a basket currency? What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, setting an \"endblock\" parameter on a basket currency doesn't do anything. The \"endblock\" parameter is only applicable to centralized (proofprotocol:2) simple token currencies, where it turns the centralized currency into a decentralized one when the endblock is reached. So, in the case of a basket currency, the \"endblock\" parameter has no effect.",
