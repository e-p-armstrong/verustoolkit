    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm new to Verus and I was wondering, can I get a Verus address on a web browser?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to get a Verus address directly on a web browser. Instead, you can get a Verus address using Verus Mobile, which is available on the App Store and Play Store, or Verus Desktop, which can be downloaded for Windows, macOS, Linux, or Linux ARM. Do you have any other questions about getting started with Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification. I was also wondering, can I use Verus Mobile to bridge from Bitcoin to Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Mobile cannot be used to bridge from Bitcoin to Verus. However, you can use Verus Mobile to bridge from Ethereum to Verus (or vice versa). If you have any questions about how to do that, I'd be happy to help!\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the correction. One more question: is it possible to run a full node (native mode) on Verus Mobile?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it'sControlItem not possible to run a full node (native mode) on Verus Mobile. You can only run a full node (native mode) on Verus Desktop. If you have any other questions about running a full node or using Verus, feel free to ask!",
