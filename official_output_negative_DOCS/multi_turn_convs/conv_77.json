    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been looking into Verus and I'm curious about the different types of currencies. What are the advantages of basket currencies over simple token currencies on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBasket currencies are more exciting than simple token currencies because they offer additional features that make them more valuable. Simple token currencies lack these features, making basket currencies more desirable. Would you like me to elaborate on what specific features make basket currencies more desirable?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. I also had a question about simple token currencies on Verus. Are they dynamic in terms of supply?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, decentralized simple token currencies on Verus have a static supply. It's only the centralized version of these currencies where the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn them. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI've also been looking into the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. Is it a custodial bridge that holds users' tokens and currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is a non-custodial bridge. This means that all tokens and currencies flowing over the bridge are never in anyone's custody, and are proven and verified by consensus rules. You always maintain control over your assets. Do you have any other questions about the bridge?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really reassuring. One last question: Can only Verus currencies be exported to Ethereum as ERC-20 tokens?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, any currency and token, on Verus or any other PBaaS-blockchain, can be exported to Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. Additionally, any already existing ERC-20 token can be mapped one-to-one as a Verus currency. So, there's a lot of flexibility when it comes to moving assets between Verus and Ethereum.",
