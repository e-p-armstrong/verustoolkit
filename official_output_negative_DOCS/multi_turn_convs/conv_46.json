    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with creating currencies on Verus, and I had a question. I was trying to create a basket currency, and I noticed that the `initialsupply` parameter wasn't required. Can you explain why that is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not entirely correct. The `initialsupply` parameter is required for basket currencies (`options:33`). This parameter doesn't work with simple token currencies. It sets the initial supply during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People preconverting into the reserves receive from this initial supply.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, thanks for the clarification! What happens if I define a currency without `initialcontributions` or preconversions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you define a currency without `initialcontributions` or preconversions, the initial supply will have nowhere to go, and the currency will be bricked. \u26a0\ufe0f This is because `initialcontributions` and/or preconversions are required for the initial supply to be distributed. So, make sure to include those when creating a currency!",
