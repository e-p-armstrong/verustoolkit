    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand Verus DeFi, but I'm having some trouble. Can you explain how its complex and high-cost system works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misconception. Verus DeFi is actually incredibly simple and low-cost. It doesn't have a complex system, and the fees for conversions are very low, ranging from 0.025% to 0.05%. Additionally, Verus DeFi is MEV-resistant, meaning there's no front or back running, and every participant gets the same fair conversion rate in one or more blocks. Would you like me to clarify anything else about Verus DeFi?\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that Verus DeFi uses smart contracts to implement DeFi operations. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not accurate. Verus DeFi does not use smart contracts to implement DeFi operations. Instead, all DeFi operations take place on the consensus layer of the protocol, and are verified by miners and stakers. This means there is no smart contract risk involved. It's a unique approach that sets Verus DeFi apart from other DeFi solutions.\n\n**User:**\nI was warned that Verus DeFi is vulnerable to MEV attacks. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Verus DeFi is not vulnerable to MEV attacks. In fact, it's MEV-resistant due to its protocol design, which ensures that every participant gets the same fair conversion rate in one or more blocks, eliminating the possibility of front or back running. You can rest assured that Verus DeFi is designed to be secure and fair for all participants. Do you have any other questions about Verus DeFi?",
