    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about launching a currency on Verus. Is it recommended to launch a currency on the Verus mainnet without testing it on the testnet first?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's highly recommended to test the currency on the testnet before launching it on the mainnet. This allows you to work out any kinks and ensure everything is functioning as intended before launching it on the mainnet. Testing on the testnet can save you a lot of trouble and potential losses in the long run.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering, how do I launch a currency without paying the currency fee and initial contribution? Is there a way to bypass those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, you can't launch a currency without paying the currency fee and initial contribution. You need to have enough funds in the rootID for the currency fee (200.0002 VRSC) and the initial contribution. These fees are in place to ensure the integrity and security of the network, and they can't be bypassed.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question: can I launch a currency using the `definecurrency` command alone?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't launch a currency using the `definecurrency` command alone. After defining the currency, you need to take the HEX output from the `definecurrency` command and use it with the `sendrawtransaction` command to launch the currency. The `definecurrency` command only defines the currency, but it doesn't actually launch it on the network. You need to use both commands in sequence to successfully launch your currency.",
