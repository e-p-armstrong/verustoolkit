    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about VerusIDs and I'm interested in creating one, but I'm on a tight budget. Is there a way to create a VerusID without paying any costs on the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI understand your concern! Unfortunately, that's not possible. On the Verus blockchain, creating a VerusID always incurs a cost, which is 100 VRSC by default. However, you can reduce this cost by using a referral, which would bring the cost down to 80 VRSC. All costs paid go to the miners and stakers of the ecosystem and to the referrals if used. So, while there is a cost involved, it's a necessary part of using the Verus blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been looking into the referral system, and I was wondering, can I receive more than 60 VRSC as a referral reward for each VerusID creation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not possible. The referral system only goes three levels down, and the maximum referral reward you can receive is 60 VRSC per VerusID creation, if you have three identities stringed together through referrals. So, while the referral system can help offset the cost of creating a VerusID, there is a limit to how much you can earn through referrals.",
