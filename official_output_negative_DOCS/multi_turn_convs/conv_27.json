    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have some questions about using VerusIDs. Can you explain how to send simple token currencies or basket currencies to a z-address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, it's not possible to send simple token currencies or basket currencies to a z-address. Z-addresses can only contain the native blockchain currency. It's a limitation of z-addresses, but it's an important part of how they work.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering about private-to-private transactions. Do they keep the sender's and recipient's addresses and amounts completely private?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPrivate-to-private transactions do offer a high level of privacy, but they don't keep the sender's and recipient's addresses and amounts completely private. While the sender's address and the amount sent are not visible, and the recipient's address(es) and received amount(s) are not visible, it is still possible to correlate transactions by time and amounts between public and private addresses, potentially linking two public addresses based on transaction patterns.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what about public-to-private transactions? Are they completely anonymous?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, public-to-private transactions are not completely anonymous. While the recipient's address(es) and received amount(s) are not visible, it is still possible to correlate transactions by time and amounts between public and private addresses, potentially linking two public addresses based on transaction patterns. So, while they offer some level of privacy, they're not completely anonymous.",
