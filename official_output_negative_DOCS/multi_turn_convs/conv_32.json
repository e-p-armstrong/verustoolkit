    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few more questions about VerusIDs. Are they limited to binding to only a few specific types of data or content?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not limited in this way. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private. This includes provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the VerusID itself. So, you can bind a wide range of data and content to your VerusID.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! Another question I had was, can a VerusID only be controlled by a single identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a VerusID can be controlled by any number of identities. It can also be set up with (time)locks, revoked, and recovered. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and customization when it comes to controlling your VerusID.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. I've heard that only certain characters are allowed when creating a VerusID. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. All characters from all character sets are available to create a VerusID, except for a few specific characters: `/`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `\"`, `<`, `>`, `|`, `@`, and `.`. So, you have a wide range of characters to choose from when creating your VerusID.",
