    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about VerusPay. How does it handle invoice management and processing?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, VerusPay is not a centralized payment processor. It's a decentralized blockchain payment platform within the Verus ecosystem, designed to facilitate the creation, management, and processing of invoices utilizing blockchain technology. It standardizes the format for invoices, ensuring interoperability, security, and ease of use across different blockchain systems. So, it's not a centralized processor, but rather a decentralized platform that enables secure and efficient invoice management and processing.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I thought VerusPay invoices were only for transactions within the Verus network. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. VerusPay invoices can be used for transactions not only within the Verus network but also across different blockchain ecosystems. The VerusPay Invoice specification supports handling conversions and accepting payments from various PBaaS blockchains. So, VerusPay invoices are actually quite versatile and can be used across multiple blockchain systems.\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to integrate VerusPay into my application, but I couldn't find any official resources or libraries to help me do so. Is there really no official library or resource available for integrating VerusPay?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to help you with that! That's not true. There is an official helper library available for integrating VerusPay into applications or services: the verusid-ts-client helper library, which can be found on GitHub. This library provides the necessary tools and resources for developers to utilize VerusPay in their own projects. You should be able to find everything you need to integrate VerusPay into your application there.",
