    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI was wondering, how do you set up a trust fund for your children without using a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can set up a trust fund for your children using a VerusID. You can give your child a time-locked VerusID with funds on it, and when they turn 18, the VerusID unlocks, and the funds can be spent. You can also keep revocation and recovery authorities with yourself or a trustee. This way, you have control over the funds until your child is old enough to manage them themselves.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a great idea! But I have another question. Is it possible to unlock a VerusID and spend the funds immediately if someone gains access to the private keys?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not possible. When someone gains access to the private keys of a locked VerusID, they have to unlock the identity in order to spend the funds. When someone makes an unlock request that isn't you, you are warned. The intruder has to wait for the specified delay (e.g., 10,080 blocks, or ~1 week) before they can spend the funds. If you have set up revocation and recovery authorities, you now have time to safeguard your funds away from prying hands, back into your control.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really reassuring to know! One more question: Can you buy and sell VerusIDs through a centralized exchange?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not how it works. With the VerusID Marketplace protocol, anyone is able to buy and sell VerusIDs in a 100% principalTable, decentralized manner, without any middleman or contract controller. You can look for offers on any VerusID (buy or sell offers), and if you like the best offer on your VerusID, or if someone likes an offer you made on theirs, the deal is made peer-to-peer, directly on the blockchain. This way, you have full control over the buying and selling process, and there's no need for a centralized exchange.",
