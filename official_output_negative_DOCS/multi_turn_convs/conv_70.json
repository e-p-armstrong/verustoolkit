    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a simple token currency and I was wondering, how do I create one using the `preallocations` parameter?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `preallocations` parameter isn't used to create a simple token currency. It's used to receive a chosen amount of funds after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. It works with both simple token currencies and basket currencies. To create a simple token currency, you would use the `definecurrency` command without specifying the `options` parameter as 33, which is specific to basket currencies.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Let's say I want to set the initial supply of a currency to 20 billion. Can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot set the initial supply of a currency to 20 billion. The recommended absolute limit for all currency supplies is 10 billion (minus 1 satoshi) with 8 decimal places (9999999999.99999999).\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for letting me know. One more question: Does the `prelaunchcarveout` parameter work with simple token currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `prelaunchcarveout` parameter only works with basket currencies (`options:33`). It is used to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the rootID after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched.",
