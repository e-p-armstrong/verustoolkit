    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been using VerusIDs for a while now, but I'm still not sure about how to use them for private transactions. Can you walk me through how to use a VerusID to send funds privately?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is a public friendly-name cryptocurrency address, so it's not suitable for sending funds privately. However, a VerusID can contain a pointer to a z-address, which is a private cryptocurrency address. You can send coins to `VerusID@:private` to utilize the z-address for private transactions. Would you like more information on how to set up a z-address or how private transactions work on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thank you! I'm still trying to understand the different types of addresses in Verus. What's the main difference between an R-address and a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAn R-address is a public cryptocurrency address derived from a private key, whereas a VerusID is a public friendly-name cryptocurrency address controlled by a primary address, which is an R-address. So, an R-address is a more basic type of address, whereas a VerusID is a higher-level address that's easier to use and remember. Think of a VerusID like a username, and an R-address like the underlying account number. Does that help clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been wondering about z-addresses. Are z-addresses visible on blockchain explorers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, z-addresses are private addresses, and their balances and transactions are confidential. They do not appear on the blockchain or any explorer. Only the person with the private key can spend and see the balance of a z-address, or provide visibility into the balance through a \"viewing key\". This adds an extra layer of privacy to your transactions. Do you have any more questions about z-addresses or private transactions on Verus?",
