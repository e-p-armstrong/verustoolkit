    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create an invoice and I'm not sure about one of the fields. What is the purpose of the \"Requested Currency Name\" field in an invoice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there is no \"Requested Currency Name\" field in an invoice. The correct field is \"Requested Currency ID\", which specifies the identifier for the currency in which the payment is requested.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the correction. I'm still a bit unsure about another field. Can I specify a specific date and time for the invoice to expire using the \"Expiry Height\" field?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the \"Expiry Height\" field does not specify a specific date and time for the invoice to expire. Instead, it optionally specifies a Verus blockchain height after which the invoice is considered expired. Does that clarify things for you?",
