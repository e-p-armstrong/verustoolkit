    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. How does the central authority control the transfer of assets between Verus and Ethereum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there is no central authority controlling the transfer of assets between Verus and Ethereum using the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. The Bridge is trustless and non-custodial, meaning that no single entity has control over the assets being transferred. Instead, the decentralized network of miners and stakers verifies and accounts for funds crossing the bridge, ensuring a secure and trustworthy transfer process.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I thought I heard that the Bridge had been operational for a while now. Is the Verus-Ethereum Bridge operational since 2020?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is not operational since 2020. The Bridge has been fully operational since October 20, 2023. So, it's still relatively new, but it's already making a big impact in the crypto community!",
