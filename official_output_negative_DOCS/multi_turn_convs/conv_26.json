    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and basket currencies. I had a question about option 1. Can you explain why option 1 is only used for decentralized currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception. Option 1 is not only used for decentralized currencies. In fact, a currency with option 1 can be launched either centralized or decentralized. This option allows the currency to have reserves and be convertible to and from those reserves, making it a \"Basket currency\". The level of decentralization is determined by the \"proofprotocol\" parameter, not by option 1.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes more sense. Can any options be combined with each other when launching a basket currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, any of the options can be combined with each other, as long as they are compatible. For example, options 1, 2, and 32 can be combined to launch a basket currency that only allows the rootID to create subIDs. The possibilities are numerous, and there are many examples of combined options.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Can you explain why the \"proofprotocol\" parameter has specific values?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"proofprotocol\" parameter actually has three possible values: 1, 2, or 3. These values determine whether the currency is centralized or decentralized, among other things. The specific values were chosen to provide a range of options for developers to design their currencies in a way that suits their needs.",
