    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard about PBaaS-chains and I'm interested in launching one, but I don't have any programming knowledge. Is it possible to launch a PBaaS-chain without extensive coding skills?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, launching a PBaaS-chain doesn't require programming knowledge. Any user with a VerusID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged blockchain without needing to write code. This is a key feature of the Verus platform. So, don't worry about not having programming skills, you can still create your own PBaaS-chain!\n\n**User:**\nThat's great news! I also heard that launching a PBaaS-chain is free and doesn't require any VRSC. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Launching a PBaaS-chain actually costs 10,000 VRSC. The cost is distributed among the block producers of the Verus chain and the new PBaaS-chain, with 5,000 VRSC going to each group. So, while it's not free, it's still a great opportunity to create your own blockchain or token currency.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question, I was wondering if VerusID can be used to create a centralized ID system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusID is designed to provide self-sovereign identities, which are decentralized and give users full control over their own identities. It's not intended for creating centralized ID systems. VerusID features include namespace for currencies, tokens, and PBaaS-blockchains, friendly-name addresses, revocable, recoverable, NFTs, profiles, and can be bound to any type of data. So, if you're looking for a decentralized ID system, VerusID is a great option, but if you're looking for a centralized system, it's not the right tool for the job.",
