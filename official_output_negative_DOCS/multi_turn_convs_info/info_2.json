            "Why is it important to carefully consider the assignment of `RevokeID` and `RecoveryID` when creating a VerusID?",
            "It's important to carefully consider the assignment of `RevokeID` and `RecoveryID` to ensure that the desired level of control and recoverability is achieved. For example, assigning a `RecoveryID` to `self` when the `RevokeID` is assigned to another identity would prevent recovery of the identity after revocation.",
            "When creating a VerusID users can assign a ``RevokeID`` and a ``RecoveryID`` to their VerusID. They can be the same identities, different ones or appointed ``self``. These assigned identities are also VerusIDs and thus must be purchased.| Action | Outcome |\n| :----------------------- | :-- | \n| Revoking | Funds can not be spent anymore | \n| Recovering | Recover all assets to a new address. Funds and UTXOs can be spent again |::: danger Be Careful\nDon't assign a ``RecoveryID`` to ``self`` when the ``RevokeID`` is assigned to another identity. This way when you revoke an identity, you can not recover it anymore.\n:::## Verus Vault\nThe Verus Vault for identities is a unique feature to create extra security. Set locks or timelocks to safeguard funds on a VerusID. Locked identities can not spend funds.### How it Works\nThere are three stages the Vault can be set to. When the vault is locked it can not spend funds.| Action | Outcome |\n| :----------------------- | :-- | \n| Locked until x blocks | Funds can not be spent, until a predetermined number of blocks have passed | \n| Locked with delay | Funds can not be spent, until an unlock has been requested + predetermined number of blocks have passed | \n| Unlocked | Funds can be spent |When a VerusID is locked or timelocked, it can still receive, hold and stake funds. It can also still be used for signing.[Learn here how to set up Verus Vault in Verus Desktop](/guides/setup-vault-v2/)::: warning Revoking Locked VerusID\nEven when a VerusID is locked, it can still be [revoked and recovered](/verusid/specifications#revoke-recover/). \n:::### Vault Use Case Examples",
