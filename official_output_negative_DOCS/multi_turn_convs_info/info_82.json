According to the protocol's design, all fees are collected in the fee pool, and with each new block, 1% of the fee pool is added on top of the block rewards.",

This means that the fee pool is not depleted with each block, but rather, it continues to grow, and a small portion of it is distributed to miners and stakers as an incentive.",
