            "How does the Verus-Ethereum Bridge work, considering that assets are held in a central custody?",
            "The Verus-Ethereum Bridge does not hold assets in central custody. In fact, one of the key features of the bridge is that assets are never in anyone's custody. The bridge operates through the cooperation of block producers, community notary witnesses, the Bridgekeeper software, and the Ethereum smart contract, ensuring that assets are verified and proven by consensus rules at each step of cross-chain transactions, with safeguards in place to prevent hacks.",
