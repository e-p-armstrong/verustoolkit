            "Is it true that launching currencies on Verus requires extensive coding knowledge and experience?",
            "No, that's not correct. According to the Verus protocol, launching currencies on Verus does not require any coding involved. This makes it more accessible and user-friendly compared to other protocols.",
            "# Introduction\nLaunching currencies on Verus, and any other PBaaS-chain (Public Blockchains as a Service), is better, faster, cheaper and more secure than any EVM-like protocol out there. There is no coding involved.There are two types of currencies that can be launched with the Verus Protocol. Basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools) and simple token currencies. Both can be issued decentralized, or centralized with minting and burning capabilities.When a currency is launched, subIDs can be created from it. SubIDs are powerful objects on Verus (and other PBaaS-blockchains). They are exactly the same as [VerusIDs](/verusid/), yet can not launch blockchains or currencies.## Basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools)\n![image-basket-currencies](/images/currencies-reserves.png)Basket currencies function like automated market makers (AMMs), they have reserves. A reserve can be any currency or token on the Verus network (also bridged). Have a look at the simplified image. If anyone has currency X or Y, they can convert to the basket currency, or convert from reserve to reserve. If anyone has the basket currency, they can go to currency X or Y. A basket currency can have 1 and up to 10 currencies in its reserves.The basket currency supply is dynamic, depending on how much is converted to the basket currency (supply minted), or back to its reserve(s) (supply burned).A basket currency can be 100% backed by its reserves, 5%, or anything in between. This is called the reserve ratio, or the weight. The lower the reserve ratio, the more volatile the currency is when people are converting into or out of the basket currency. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to what is in the reserves and what the reserve ratio is.",

            "What are the only two types of currencies that can be launched on Verus, and are they both centralized?",
            "The two types of currencies that can be launched on Verus are basket currencies (e.g., liquidity pools) and simple token currencies. However, both types of currencies can be issued in a decentralized manner, not just centralized. They can also have minting and burning capabilities if desired.",
