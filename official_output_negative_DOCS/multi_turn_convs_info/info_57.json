            "How do I use a VerusID to send funds privately?",
            "A VerusID is a public friendly-name cryptocurrency address, so it's not suitable for sending funds privately. However, a VerusID can contain a pointer to a z-address, which is a private cryptocurrency address. You can send coins to `VerusID@:private` to utilize the z-address for private transactions.",

            "An R-address is a public cryptocurrency address derived from a private key, whereas a VerusID is a public friendly-name cryptocurrency address controlled by a primary address, which is an R-address. So, an R-address is a more basic type of address, whereas a VerusID is a higher-level address that's easier to use and remember.",
