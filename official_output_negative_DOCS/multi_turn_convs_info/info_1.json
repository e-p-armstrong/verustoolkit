            "What happens if the minimum preconversion amount is met for a currency launch?",
            "Actually, the opposite happens. If the minimum preconversion amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds back, minus the transaction and conversion fees.",
            "Example currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"CommunityX\", \n \"options\":33, \n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\",\"MyBrand\",\"InfluencerCoin\"], \n \"minpreconversion\":[10,50,10],\n \"initialsupply\":100\n}'\n```\n\u261d\ufe0f A basket currency called CommunityX. It needs to get a minimum of 10 VRSCTEST, 50 MyBrand and 10 InfluencerCoin into its reserves within the preconversion time frame to be launched. The initial supply of 100 CommunityX will be distributed among the preconverters.### **\"conversions\"**\nUse this parameter when launching a simple token currency. Together with `\"currencies\"`, it can be used as a funding mechanism for the rootID. This parameter is for the preconversion price. So when doing `\"conversions\":[0.1]`, it means that for every VRSC the preconverter receives 10 CURRENCY after launch. The converted VRSC goes into the rootID.People can preconvert to this currency within the preconversion time frame. Define a `\"startblock\"`, or let the default and minimum time frame play out, which is 20 blocks.Example currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"CoolBrand\",\n \"options\":32,\n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\n \"conversions\":[0.1],\n \"minpreconversion\":[1000]\n}'\n```\n\u261d\ufe0f This simple token currency is called CoolBrand. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 1000 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 10.000 CoolBrand. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds back.### **\"minpreconversion\"**\nUse this parameter to set a minimum amount of preconversions. The minimum amount of preconversions needs to be met or the currency will not launch and everyone gets their conversions returned, minus the transaction and conversion fees. It works both with basket currencies and simple token currencies.",
