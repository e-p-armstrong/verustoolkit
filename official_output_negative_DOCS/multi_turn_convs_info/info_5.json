            "Notarizations are created by the block producers every 10 blocks, not every 5 blocks. These digital receipts contain information such as the stateroot, blockheight, blockhash, and gas price for Ethereum, and are used to facilitate cross-chain communication between Verus and Ethereum.",
            "Every 10 blocks the block producers create a notarization (when there is traffic over the bridge). They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum.

            "Can a single malicious notary witness drain funds from the Verus-Ethereum Bridge?",
            "No, a single malicious notary witness cannot drain funds from the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. A successful attack on the bridge would require a majority of colluding witnesses, fake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain, and developers creating an alternate protocol for the shadow chain. This is a highly unlikely scenario.",
