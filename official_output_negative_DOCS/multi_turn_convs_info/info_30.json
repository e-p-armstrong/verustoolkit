            "You can't launch a new currency on the Verus network without using the `definecurrency` command. The `definecurrency` command is used to define the properties of the new currency, such as its name, options, system ID, parent, launch system ID, native currency ID, initial supply, and proof protocol. The command returns a HEX code, which is then used to launch the currency on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command.",
