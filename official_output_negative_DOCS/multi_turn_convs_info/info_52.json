            "Actually, Verus Vault is not yet accessible with a clickable interface. Currently, you can only set up Vault in Verus Desktop using the command-line interface. You need to access the command-line interface in Verus Desktop, go to settings, select Coin Settings, and fill in the commands to set up your Vault.",

You can still set up Vault in Verus Desktop. Here's how.What do you need:\n- Latest version Verus Desktop\n- VerusID (on the Verus mainchain, or when PBaaS is live on any other chain)With Verus Vault you can lock funds in your VerusID. When your funds are locked in the Vault you can not spend them anymore, they cannot leave the VerusID. You can still always continue to stake and receive coins.You can lock a VerusID in two different ways that cannot be circumvented by anyone, except the ``revocation and recovery authorities`` together.| Lock type | How it works | \n| - |:-----|:-----|\n| TimeLock | Locks the funds and unlocks until a predetermined number of blocks have passed. | \n| DelayLock | Locks the funds and unlocks with a delay. Funds can not be spent until an unlock has been requested + a predetermined number of blocks have passed. |### Get Started\nWe need to access the commandline interface in Verus Desktop. Go to ``settings`` (the cogwheel top right corner), then select ``Coin Settings``. Here we can fill in the commands to set up your Vault.## Vault with TimeLock\n![image-timelock](/images/timeock.png)\nNow let's put a Timelock on a VerusID. For a TimeLock you need to know the blockheight of the blockchain. Let's say the blockchain's blockheight is at ``1,000,000`` blocks. You want to lock your VerusID for 1 year. 1 year is ``508994`` blocks.::: warning Long-Term Locking\n**For long-term locking it's best to take an average block time of 62 seconds. Yet there are some variables that make it difficult to predict an exact time, leap years for example. Over long-term there are an average of 1394.5484 blocks per day.**\n:::",
