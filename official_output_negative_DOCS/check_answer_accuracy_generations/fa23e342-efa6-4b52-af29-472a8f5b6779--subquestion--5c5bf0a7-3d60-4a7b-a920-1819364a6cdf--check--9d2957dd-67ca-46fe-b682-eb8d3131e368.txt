    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\

    # Introduction

    Launching currencies on Verus, and any other PBaaS-chain (Public Blockchains as
    a Service), is better, faster, cheaper and more secure than any EVM-like protocol
    out there. There is no coding involved.There are two types of currencies that
    can be launched with the Verus Protocol. Basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools)
    and simple token currencies. Both can be issued decentralized, or centralized
    with minting and burning capabilities.When a currency is launched, subIDs can
    be created from it. SubIDs are powerful objects on Verus (and other PBaaS-blockchains).
    They are exactly the same as [VerusIDs](/verusid/), yet can not launch blockchains
    or currencies.## Basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools)

    ![image-basket-currencies](/images/currencies-reserves.png)Basket currencies function
    like automated market makers (AMMs), they have reserves. A reserve can be any
    currency or token on the Verus network (also bridged). Have a look at the simplified
    image. If anyone has currency X or Y, they can convert to the basket currency,
    or convert from reserve to reserve. If anyone has the basket currency, they can
    go to currency X or Y. A basket currency can have 1 and up to 10 currencies in
    its reserves.The basket currency supply is dynamic, depending on how much is converted
    to the basket currency (supply minted), or back to its reserve(s) (supply burned).A
    basket currency can be 100% backed by its reserves, 5%, or anything in between.
    This is called the reserve ratio, or the weight. The lower the reserve ratio,
    the more volatile the currency is when people are converting into or out of the
    basket currency. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to what is
    in the reserves and what the reserve ratio is.

    The two types of currencies that can be launched on Verus are basket currencies
