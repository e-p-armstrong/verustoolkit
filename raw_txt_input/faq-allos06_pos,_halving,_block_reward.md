Question 1: I have x amount of mature coins in my public address. How many blocks can I expect to get on average from PoS?
Question 2: When is next halving, what is the block reward, and how long will it last?
Question 3: How many timelocked coins have been unlocked and are mature?

Download this spreadsheet and keep it handy to input current blockheight and amount of coins you are staking when you want to know.
You can also enter a percentage for guessing how many coins are actually staking, to see when it matches your own actual average.
See your own percentage of total coins possible to stake, and pay attention to the number day to day, to see how your position holds up.
The spreadsheet will also show how many days until the next halvings.
The calculation of timelocked coins being unlocked is based on an average for the entire period, but should be fairly accurate, and is included in the total of staking coins.

note: Verus Desktop uses the live info from the blockchain with regards to locked coins, coins in z-addresses, current coinsupply, minimum stake age of UTXOs and staking difficulty to display real-time predictions of your profitability on your staking balance.
