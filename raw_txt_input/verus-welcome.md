# Welcome to Verus

## The Future Is Now

Here is a collection of information meant to span several platforms and services in order to keep all of us more informed on what’s happening across the growing, world-wide community. It will also help to connect us, allowing us to discuss what’s being worked on, what can be done to help and as a way to look ahead in a more involved way.

Verus, latin for “True”, combines all of the features we believe are important in a cryptocurrency, and provides a foundation for future development. Verus is a fork of Zcash and Komodo that leverages the Komodo platform, and we appreciate the contributions and support from those teams as well as the Bitcoin developers that created a foundation for us to launch new capabilities **in a system that supports Bitcoin and Zcash compatible transaction types as well as Komodo cross chain swaps** and dPoW security enhancements.

1. Verus Coin is a pure technology provider and does not endorse third party projects.
2. Be your own bank: **you** are responsible for securing your coins and taking backups.
3. **No VerusCoin community member, admin, or developer should __ever__, under __any__ circumstances, ask for your private keys or for you to send coins to them. Please __report__ any incident in the #community-support channel.**

## The VerusCoin Community is YOU\!

If you’ve been around long enough and feel a little skeptical or disillusioned from a few bad experiences elsewhere, it’s totally understandable. We’ve all had them and we know quite well that when unscrupulous projects abuse words like decentralization, interoperability, or protocol level solutions, it can have a *“boy who cried wolf”* effect.

We believe that actions speak louder than words. Anything that may be considered hype can be backed up with functional examples. What we’re doing here is genuine. We are trying to be the real deal, **just as Bitcoin started out, as an open-source, fair launched, no ICO, or pre-mined, or even dev funded project.** Despite this, a foundation has been established by and for fellow community members. There is always more to be done and the foundation regularly pays out bounties to community members that help to make the Verus vision a reality. In fact, just about everything has been designed to reinforce the community. Designed with efficiency in mind, only the miners and stakers are rewarded for securing the chains. This ensures bare minimum costs to the end user starting up a chain and the sleek UI removes the technical barrier.

## NEW TO VERUS?

### What we’re about:

Put simply, Verus is much more than any single ordinary blockchain; more of an entire ecosystem of **interconnected blockchains that all operate decentralized and at the protocol level**. Verus introduces Verus PBaaS (__**Public Blockchains as a Service**__), a true publicly notarized blockchain as a service with an easy to use built in wallet UI, designed to make it so that now anyone can start their very own full-fledged cryptocurrency so long as it can be funded or supported by miners. Newly created chains are just as secure as Verus itself and have the ability to be merge mined (up to __22x__ at once\!)

Benefiting both the user and the miners, self-strengthening the ecosystem and ensuring minimal fees (no room for middlemen to take a cut). Reserve backed currencies are also possible with __fractional reserve__ capabilities and since interoperability is paramount, exchanging currencies in __cross-chain transactions__ is as simple as sending coins from one wallet to a different coin’s wallet. __Conversions__ are handled by a built in market maker that automatically determines price based on a predetermined curve and issues orders fairly to all buy/sells within a block, with zero spread and the added benefit of eliminating the well- established problem of front-running, just some amount of slippage based on the net buy/sell.. With reserve currencies, buyers can make buys without even needing sellers (and vice versa).
Amazingly, everything is done at the __protocol level__ on a decentralized network, meaning Verus and it's associated chains can't be censored or stopped.

## VerusID

VerusIDs are true self-sovereign identities and aren't simply an ID system as much as a fully functional blockchain protocol. There is no business in the protocol, but plenty of opportunity for those who use what it can do for identity applications. Verus ID provides:

**Quantum ready** friendly crypto addresses on the worldwide Verus network -- VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID -> destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

**Fully decentralized** -- anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.

**Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.

**Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.

**Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.

### A Built-in Decentralized Referral Program, Enabling Natural Growth.

Verus IDs will cost Verus to acquire, 100 Verus per ID to be exact, which can be discounted to 80 Verus with referral of an existing Verus ID. The interesting twist is that all of the cost of an ID goes back into the network, either as referral fees, which are a way to get discounts or possibly even make money through referrals and built into the identity transactions themselves, or as mining and staking fees. No one besides people participating in the network as miners, stakers, or ID referrers take any proceeds from the cost of an identity. If you refer someone new and they purchase an ID with your ID as a referral, they will receive a 20% discount on the ID. In addition:

1. You will receive 20 Verus directly
2. The person who referred you, if there is one, will receive 20 Verus
3. The person who referred person b, if there is one, will receive 20 Verus, and
3. The miner or staker will receive the remainder of the discounted 80 Verus cost

As you might expect from looking at the fact that anywhere from 20 to 100 Verus goes to miners and stakers of Verus for each new identity once identities hit mainnet, some Verus blocks may have VERY high rewards for some time. The best thing about that is that regardless of how much the Verus blockchain rewards miners over and above the pre-determined coinbase reward, it will be as a result of the **on-chain economy**, paid for by people buying identities with **no inflation** of the money supply\! If you or your friends missed the early days of the Verus launch, **you don't want to miss this** new opportunity to be mining, staking or referring now **Verus IDs are activated on the mainnet\!**.

## VerusPay

#### Blockchain-integrated payment gateway for accepting Verus Coin (VRSC) in a WooCommerce ecommerce store

This plugin extends *WooCommerce* on *Wordpress*, adding the ability to accept cryptocurrency payments in Verus Coin (VRSC) using either an on-store wallet daemon (best for VPS or dedicated hosting stores) or manually configured VRSC addresses (best for shared hosting stores).

When an order is submitted via the VerusPay gateway, the order will be placed "on-hold" while awaiting payment from the customer. The customer has a limited time wherein to send the payment and the store monitors the wallet/address to confirm payment received before releasing the order and redirecting the customer to the Thank You page.

VerusPay uses limited API functionality for Manual Mode, to communicate with the blockchain explorer in verifying payments and with the veruspay.io API to get up-to-date price data. These API's do not receive any private data either about the store owner, store, or customer. The only data sent to the block explorer API is the public/transparent blockchain transaction and address used. For VerusPay.io API price data, only the store-set currency is sent to retrieve the current fiat exchange rate for Verus Coin.
