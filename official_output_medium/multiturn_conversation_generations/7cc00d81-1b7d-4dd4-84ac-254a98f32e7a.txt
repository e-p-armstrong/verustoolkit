    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

    How do I install a Linux distribution on my system in order to mine Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    To install a Linux distribution on your system for mining Verus, you can use the
    `proot-distro` package. First, install `proot-distro` by running the command `pkg
    install proot-distro`. Then, you can install a supported Linux distribution, such
    as Ubuntu 20.04, by running the command `proot-distro install ubuntu-20.04`. After
    installation, you can log in to the distribution by running `proot-distro login
    ubuntu-20.04`.



    **QUESTION:**

    What are the necessary steps to update and prepare my Linux system for mining
    Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    To update and prepare your Linux system for mining Verus, you need to update the
    system packages by running `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y`. Then, you need
    to install additional packages and dependencies by running `apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
    libssl-dev libjansson-dev automake autotools-dev build-essential git nano`. These
    steps will ensure that your system has the necessary tools and libraries to compile
    and run the Verus miner.



    **QUESTION:**

    How do I clone the ccminer repository and prepare it for building the Verus miner?


    **ANSWER:**

    To clone the ccminer repository and prepare it for building the Verus miner, you
    need to run the command `git clone --single-branch -b ARM https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer.git`.
    Then, navigate to the `ccminer/` folder and make the `build.sh`, `configure.sh`,
    and `autogen.sh` files executable by running `chmod +x build.sh && chmod +x configure.sh
    && chmod +x autogen.sh`. This will allow you to execute the `build.sh` script
    to compile the miner.



    **QUESTION:**

    What do I need to do to configure the `run` file for mining Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    To configure the `run` file for mining Verus, you need to edit the file using
    a text editor like `nano`. You can do this by running `nano run`. In the file,
    you need to update the `Pool_URL`, `MINING_Address.WORKER_NAME`, and `THREADS
    NUMBERS` to match your mining setup. You can then save the file by pressing `Ctrl+x`,
    responding with `Y`, and pressing `Enter`. The `run` file should contain a command
    like `./ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://Pool_URL:PORT -u MINING_Address.WORKER_NAME
    -p x -t THREADS NUMBERS`.



    **QUESTION:**

    Why is it important to monitor and limit the number of CPU threads used for mining
    Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    It is important to monitor and limit the number of CPU threads used for mining
    Verus because mining is a CPU-intensive task that can cause heat buildup and potentially
    damage your device. It is recommended to choose a lower number of threads and
    monitor the system''s temperature and performance to prevent overheating. You
    can find the number of threads your CPU has by running the `lscpu` command.
