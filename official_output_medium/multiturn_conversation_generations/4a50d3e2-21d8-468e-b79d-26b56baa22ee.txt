    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    Yes, actually. If I run `./verusd` and encounter the errors I mentioned earlier,

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    What kind of transactions does Verus support, and what makes them private?


    **ANSWER:**

    Verus supports provably zero-knowledge transactions, which means that the sender,
    receiver, and amount of the transaction are mathematically, provably private.
    These transactions can also include encrypted messages.



    **QUESTION:**

    How did Verus ensure a fair launch and prevent a large amount of supply from entering
    the market at once?


    **ANSWER:**

    At launch, Verus had larger, time-locked rewards for the earliest participants.
    This ensured that no significant supply would enter the market and be dumped all
    at once, preventing market volatility.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the VerusHash mining algorithm, and what makes it unique?


    **ANSWER:**

    The VerusHash mining algorithm is designed to provide a solution to the current
    ASIC situation in crypto. It is the fastest CPU mining algorithm in the world,
    and it leverages extreme integration in modern processors, effectively treating
    their internals as mini, high-speed ASICs. This allows individuals to mine easily
    from their laptop or PC and earn a significant amount of VRSC, without competing
    with specialized, purpose-built machines or on an algorithm where GPUs have a
    major advantage.



    **QUESTION:**

    How were mining and staking rewards handled in the early days of Verus, and how
    will they be handled in the future?


    **ANSWER:**

    From the beginning, all mining and staking rewards equal to or over 192 Verus
    were time-locked for release and first use randomly over the next 25 months. In
    the future, after the next halving where rewards halve to 96 Verus, they will
    not be time-locked and will be available for staking or trading within 100 blocks
    from being staked or mined.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the current phase of the Verus project, and what are the future phases?


    **ANSWER:**

    The current phase of the Verus project is Phase One, which has already been delivered
    and includes the mainnet, 50/50 PoW/PoS, time locks, and fair launch. The future
    phases are Phase Two, which includes autochains, polls, and Verus Mobile; Phase
    Three, which includes identity and proof of virtue; and Phase Four, which includes
    integrated machine learning, content, and storage.
