    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    What is the core philosophy of Verus, and how does it relate to cryptographic
    security?


    **ANSWER:**

    Verus shares the philosophy of placing cryptographic security at its heart, similar
    to Bitcoin. This means that security is a foundational element of the system,
    and Verus is designed to provide a robust and secure foundation for building global
    distributed systems and applications.



    **QUESTION:**

    How does Verus build upon the Bitcoin system, and what additional features does
    it offer?


    **ANSWER:**

    Verus builds upon the Bitcoin system by expanding it beyond payment and into other
    blockchain primitives such as privacy, finance, identification, data, and interoperability
    with other decentralized and centralized systems. These elements are included
    at the protocol level, allowing for a more comprehensive and robust system.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the significance of Verus using the UTXO accounting method, and how does
    it benefit transactions?


    **ANSWER:**

    Verus uses the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) accounting method, which allows
    for transactions to be trivially verified in parallel. This is an important benefit,
    as it enables faster and more efficient transaction processing, particularly in
    scenarios such as DeFi (Decentralized Finance).



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the Proof of Power (VerusPoP) mechanism, and how does it provide security
    for the Verus network?


    **ANSWER:**

    The Proof of Power (VerusPoP) mechanism is the foundational security mechanism
    for the Verus network. It makes it extremely difficult for an attacker to launch
    a 51% attack, as they would need to control over 50% of both the chain''s hashpower
    and its coin supply.



    **QUESTION:**

    What does it mean for Verus to be "quantum-ready", and what is the significance
    of integrating a quantum secure signature scheme?


    **ANSWER:**

    Verus being "quantum-ready" means that its design is prepared to resist attacks
    from quantum computers. Once a quantum secure signature scheme is integrated,
    it will be possible to make all transactions sent to an address retroactively
    quantum resistant, ensuring the long-term security of the network.

    **User:**

    I''d like to know more about the UTXO accounting method. What''s the significance
    of Verus using it, and how does it benefit transactions?


    **AI Assistant:**

    Verus uses the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) accounting method, which allows
    for transactions to be trivially verified in parallel. This is an important benefit,
    as it enables faster and more efficient transaction processing, particularly in
    scenarios such as DeFi (Decentralized Finance). This means that Verus can handle
    more transactions per second, making it a more scalable system. Does that make
    sense?


    **User:**

    What about the Proof of Power (VerusPoP) mechanism? How does it provide security
    for the Verus network?


    **AI Assistant:**

    The Proof of Power (VerusPoP) mechanism is the foundational security mechanism
    for the Verus network. It makes it extremely difficult for an attacker to launch
    a 51% attack, as they would need to control over 50% of both the chain''s hashpower
    and its coin supply. This means that Verus has a strong defense against malicious
    actors trying to manipulate the network. Does that help clarify how VerusPoP works?


    **User:**

    I''ve heard that Verus is "quantum-ready". What does that mean, and what''s the
