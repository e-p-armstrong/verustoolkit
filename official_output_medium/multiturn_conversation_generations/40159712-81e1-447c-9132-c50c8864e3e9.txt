    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

    What are some of the paradoxes associated with big data, and how do they relate
    to individual privacy and power?


    **ANSWER:**

    The paradoxes associated with big data include the transparency paradox (big data
    collects personal data but its operations are opaque), the identity paradox (big
    data seeks to identify individuals at the expense of individual and collective
    identity), and the power paradox (big data privileges governments and corporate
    entities at the expense of ordinary individuals). These paradoxes highlight the
    need for privacy to be the default setting to protect individual power and autonomy.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the significance of the example where Target figured out a teen girl was
    pregnant before her father did, in the context of big data and individual privacy?


    **ANSWER:**

    The Target example, where the company figured out a teen girl was pregnant before
    her father did, illustrates how big data can be used to collect and analyze personal
    information without individuals'' knowledge or consent. This example highlights
    the importance of privacy and the need for individuals to be aware of how their
    data is being used.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is Verus Coin, and what is its potential impact on voting systems and identification?


    **ANSWER:**

    Verus Coin is a blockchain-based platform that enables secure, scalable, and trustless
    voting systems, as well as secure identification systems. According to Mike Toutonghi,
    Verus has the potential to create a system where everyone can fairly contribute
    to their community and have their opinion represented without worrying about corruption
    or fraud.



    --------

    Special note: this most recent set of questions and answers is from Verus''s vision
    paper. The previous examples were from informational websites about Verus.'

    **User:**

    I''ve been thinking a lot about big data and its implications. Can you tell me
    about some of the paradoxes associated with big data, and how they relate to individual

    **AI Assistant:**

    The paradoxes associated with big data are indeed fascinating and concerning.
    There are several, but I''ll highlight a few. The transparency paradox suggests
    that big data collects personal data but its operations are opaque. The identity
    paradox reveals that big data seeks to identify individuals at the expense of
    individual and collective identity. And the power paradox shows that big data
    privileges governments and corporate entities at the expense of ordinary individuals.
    These paradoxes highlight the need for privacy to be the default setting to protect
    individual power and autonomy. It''s crucial to be aware of these paradoxes and
    their implications on our privacy and power.


    **User:**

    That''s really interesting. I remember hearing about an example where Target figured
    out a teen girl was pregnant before her father did. What''s the significance of
    that example in the context of big data and individual privacy?


    **AI Assistant:**

    Exactly! The Target example is a great illustration of how big data can be used
    to collect and analyze personal information without individuals'' knowledge or
    consent. This example highlights the importance of privacy and the need for individuals
    to be aware of how their data is being used. It''s unsettling to think that companies
    can infer sensitive information about us without our knowledge, and it raises
    questions about who should have access to our data and how it should be used.
