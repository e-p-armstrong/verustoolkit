            "What is the main benefit of the new Sapling z-address format starting with \"zs\"?",
            "The new Sapling z-address format starting with \"zs\" allows for shorter shielded addresses and enables generating addresses at scale within a wallet without computational cost. This makes it more flexible and efficient for enterprises and exchanges to create trillions of z-addresses in advance or on the fly.",
