            "What does it mean for a VerusID to be self-sovereign?",
            "A VerusID being self-sovereign means that you have complete ownership and control over your VerusID through the use of private keys. No one besides you has control over your VerusID unless you choose to grant them permission. Additionally, VerusID is a permissionless system, which means that anyone in the world can create a VerusID without needing approval from a central authority.",

Verus believes that this functionality is critical for any system of self-sovereign identities; users need a path to recover their identities if their private keys are lost or stolen, otherwise there is just too much risk in a self-sovereign system where an identity can become inaccessible with a single mistake.

It means, too, that funds held in a VerusID address are recoverable in the event of private key loss.\nMultisig: each VerusID can function as a multisig address, thus making it possible to be controlled by multiple people. In this way, new methods are provided for organizations or groups of people to work together.\nThere is more: with VerusID you also have z-addresses (Sapling) for private transactions and messages, and you can create unforgeable signatures for messages and for signing files.
