            "The concept of \"Community Contributed Value\" refers to the aggregate value created by the community through their economic activities, which is then captured and utilized by the government and powerful private forces adjacent to it, such as Wall Street and the Defense Industry, due to their proximity to the controller of the USD.",

In the fiat period, as the master of the global reserve currency, the US government has proven that this aggregate value is enormous, allowing the government and country to run persistently high budget and trade deficits, and expand the money supply at will, while still maintaining a strong dollar.\nIn addition, although specific research is hard to find on this issue, it does seem as if powerful private forces that are adjacent to the United States Government, such as Wall Street and the Defense Industry, are conferred certain advantages through their proximity to the controller of the USD.

            "What were some of the challenges faced by local community currencies in the pre-blockchain era?",
            "In the pre-blockchain era, local community currencies faced significant challenges, including difficulties in controlling currency issuance, security and moral hazard issues (such as counterfeit and over-issuance), lack of transparency and auditability, difficulties in saving and protecting funds in banks, and the inability to easily convert community currency to USD at market rates or maintain a stable and predictable value.",

            "How did the advent of blockchain technology impact the development of community currencies?",
            "The blockchain era brought new possibilities for community currencies, as it enabled the creation of transparent, auditable, and secure tokens, such as ERC-20s, which addressed many of the challenges faced by community currencies in the pre-blockchain era.
