            "What is the main difference in terms of security between Verus and other protocols like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Avalanche?",
            "The main difference is that Verus uses a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, where all currencies are accounted for and verified by the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, making it as secure as sending BTC on Bitcoin. In contrast, account-based protocols (like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Avalanche) do not have currencies as part of their consensus, making them more vulnerable to smart contract bugs and malicious developers.",

The magic here is that there is no coding involved. Anyone can launch a currency by just choosing the options and parameters they would like.

This process does not involve expensive Solidity developers or security audits, saving a lot of development costs.\nAnother big advantage is being able to export launched currencies to Ethereum as ERC-20. These currencies can then partake in the Ethereum ecosystem, yet have better security and cheaper DeFi transactions than when they are created on Ethereum itself. Each ERC-20 token can also be bridged to Verus. It\u2019s all super easy thanks to the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge.\nThis is not all some fantasy, this is all functional (the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is in testing), right now, on mainnet, on the Verus Protocol.
