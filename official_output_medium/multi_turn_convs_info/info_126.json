            "The Verus Testnet blockchain is a testing environment for the Verus network. It already has the functionalities that the PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) upgrade will bring to the mainnet. This means that the Testnet blockchain is a testing ground for features that will be available on the mainnet in the future.",
