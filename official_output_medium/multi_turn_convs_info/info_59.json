            "What are some limitations of traditional smart contract enabled blockchains, specifically in regards to liquidity pools and price discovery?",
            "Traditional smart contract enabled blockchains, which use the state machine VM model, have limitations when it comes to liquidity pools and price discovery. These limitations include sub-optimal slippage on price discovery and front-running, which can lead to unfair and inefficient use of liquidity.",
            ", and sub-optimal slippage on price discovery.\nThe Smart Contract VM Model\nPrior to Komodo and Verus, smart contract enabled blockchains have used the state machine VM model where the blockchain acts as one giant world computer on which various contracts are \u201crun\u201d. This has been realized as a system of ordered actions/transactions simulating discrete events on a timeline, executed serially, in order, which is controlled by the miner. For liquidity pools and their users, this means that, within a block, one transaction or another will be the first to be processed (usually determined by order, and selected from all possible transactions by latency or gas prices paid), while others follow, in order. In serial processing, the order of the sequenced transactions has important implications for the fair and efficient use of liquidity.\nFront-running is traditionally viewed as predatory market behavior and is endemic on Ethereum-based systems where transactions and contracts submitted to the network are public, and queue-jumping can take place. As described in the well-known 2019 paper Flash Boys 2.0 there is inevitably a race to be the \u201cnext trade\u201d, and the entire platform becomes dominated by a zero sum game to optimally position a transaction in the sequence, with advantage to the miners, who often defer, based on earnings opportunity, to the most sophisticated and well-financed players .\nLatency wars and gas price rigging are just two ways of manipulating the transaction sequence, a zero-sum arbitrage exploit. Advantage can be gained by reducing latency through better infrastructure; for example, by being in a better position in the network topology. Advantage also goes to traders/arbs who have worked out better gas price strategies, or have made deals with key miners.
