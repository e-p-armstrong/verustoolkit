            "A multi-reserve currency in Verus allows for the conversion of one currency to another without the need for an exchange. This is achieved by converting the original currencyOffsetTable to a multi-reserve currency (e.g., ETH*VRSC) and then converting the multi-reserve currency to the desired final currency (e.g., VRSC). This process eliminates the need for an exchange and provides liquidity for conversions.",

Since there is always liquidity inside a multi-reserve currency, soon anyone will be able to convert at any time.\nFor example: a person has ETH and wants to convert to VRSC.
