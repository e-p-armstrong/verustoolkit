            "What is the significance of VerusHash 2.0 in terms of mining algorithm?",
            "VerusHash 2.0 is the first mining algorithm to fully equalize GPU performance with CPUs. This means that CPUs will remain viable miners on the Verus Coin network, and GPUs will not dominate them. Additionally, it is likely to be the first field-proven solution to effective hardware equalization across current generations of today's best mining solutions.",
            "or everyone and which continues to favor decentralization.\nWhat Verus has achieved, with early numbers already in, is the creation of the first ever mining algorithm to fully equalize GPU performance with CPUs. There is still a great deal of optimization work in progress on GPUs in the community, but it is pretty clear that for VerusHash 2.0, GPUs will not dominate CPUs. The numbers on FPGAs are not in yet, as no one to my knowledge has completed an FPGA mining algorithm that works.\nThe results the community is seeing with GPUs, before optimization, strongly indicate that FPGAs, even if 20x more efficient than GPUs, will also not prevent CPUs from remaining viable miners on the Verus Coin network. Two FPGA companies have already expressed that they are working on implementation of the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm, so the great news is that VerusHash 2.0 is likely to also be the first ever field-proven solution to effective hardware equalization across current generations of today\u2019s best mining solutions.\nMine Your Own Verus Today!\nWant to start earning Verus with your PC?
