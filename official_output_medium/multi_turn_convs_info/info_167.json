            "What are the benefits of using Verus's cross-chain conversion system?",
            "The system offers several benefits, including ease of use, no spread in conversion prices, and a flat 0.05% conversion fee. This fee is distributed to miners and stakers on the Verus and PBaaS blockchains, incentivizing them to follow the protocol and providing opportunities for decentralized mining and staking profit.",
            "n XYZ chain as either Verus reserve or XYZ, which should happen based on a decentralized protocol, without any further action by you.\nWe also realized that if we make it that easy, many people are likely to do it, which would make cross-chain transactions a very common occurrence and therefore, something that needs to scale more than a simple one send/one cross-transaction relationship. To solve this, I\u2019m nearly finished developing a new, decentralized cross chain protocol, designed for high volume, provable cross-chain transaction flow with minimal per-transaction overhead. Doing that meant committing to some additional development time, but we believe in the power of this system to help society, and it is more important to get it right than have it deployed a few weeks earlier.\nPersonally, I predict that ease of use won\u2019t be the only reason cross-chain conversions will be popular.\nAll buys and sells in any given block will get the exact same conversion price with no spread and all conversion fees will be a flat 0.05%, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers on the Verus and PBaaS blockchains, which of course can all be merge-mined together. This 0.05% both incentivizes miners and stakers to follow the new protocol as intended, and allows fill-or-kill order types that eliminate the risk of front-running. Even at that incredibly small rate, it also provides huge opportunity for decentralized mining and staking profit to anyone who helps validate the Verus PBaaS ecosystem. In one very powerful sense, the Verus reserve ecosystem will have no need for and no overhead imposed by money changers, a virtue that is going to be more and more important as it grows.\nTo conclude, I wanted to provide a general update on development progress that I know about and a more in-depth update on some of the exciting technologies we\u2019re planning to deploy soon on testnet, followed shortly ",

            "The system allows for fill-or-kill order types, which eliminate the risk of front-running. This is made possible by the flat 0.05% conversion fee, which provides a financial incentive for miners and stakers to follow the protocol as intended.",
