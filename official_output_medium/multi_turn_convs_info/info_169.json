            "What is the main goal behind the development of VerusHash, and how does it contribute to the decentralization of Verus Coin?",
            "The main goal behind the development of VerusHash is to promote decentralization in Verus Coin. VerusHash is designed to be a cutting-edge proof-of-work (PoW) hashing algorithm that allows for fair and decentralized mining. By making the algorithm accessible to a wide range of devices, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, VerusHash helps to decentralize the mining process and prevent the dominance of any single group or entity.",
