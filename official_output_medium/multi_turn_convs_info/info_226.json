            "What is the core philosophy behind the Verus Project, and how does it differ from other blockchain projects?",
            "The Verus Project aims to be a public good, with no Venture Capital (VC) funding and no returns on investment that need to be drawn from users to pay back investors. It is a community-developed, Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) blockchain protocol. As a result, the only fees involved in creating and using social tokens on Verus are paid to miners who power the network, similar to Bitcoin.",
            " practice. Five years in development, and with a working network (minus these token capabilities) for the last three years, the Verus Project has built the protocols. Verus aims to be a public good. There are no VCs funding the project and so no returns on investment that need to be drawn from users to pay back investors. It is a community developed FOSS blockchain protocol. The only fees involved in creating and using social tokens on Verus will be paid, as in bitcoin, to miners who power the network.\nThese capabilities as described do not exist on smart contract platforms today. Perhaps they could be engineered on a case by case basis by a team of competent smart contract developers. But, this would require complex interconnecting smart contracts to deal with all of the disparate elements. It would be an enormous engineering effort, fraught with risk and complexity. On Verus, using primitives as building blocks, these tokens can be issued in just a few minutes, with bespoke variables, by non-programmers, and at little cost.\nAdditional Capabilities\nApart from the core functionality of social tokens described above, there are also some interesting capabilities that enhance the concept. First, as a fork of zcash, Verus offers private transactions on its native currency. And, as a UTXO blockchain, wallets control multiple addresses which cannot necessarily be traced to the same wallet. This gives the ability for intelligent apps to protect user\u2019s privacy as they interact with social tokens.\nAlso, on-chain escrow mechanisms allow for issuers to timelock their holdings for arbitrary periods. This helps reduce potential moral hazard where fans and speculators might be concerned about issuers dumping their holdings and \u201crugging\u201d their community. Roll has always been concerned about this possibility, and that led them to provide centralized escrow services for their issuers.",

            "How do social tokens on Verus compare to those on smart contract platforms?",
            "Social tokens on Verus have capabilities that do not exist on smart contract platforms today. While it might be possible to engineer similar capabilities on a case-by-case basis using smart contracts, it would require a complex and risky engineering effort. In contrast, Verus allows non-programmers to issue social tokens with bespoke variables in just a few minutes, at little cost, using primitives as building blocks.",

            "Verus offers additional capabilities that enhance the concept of social tokens. These include private transactions on its native currency, thanks to its fork from Zcash, and the ability for wallets to control multiple addresses that cannot be traced to the same wallet, providing a level of privacy protection.
