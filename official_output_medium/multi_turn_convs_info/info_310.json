            "How does Verus achieve high scalability?",
            "Verus achieves high scalability by scaling out, not scaling up. This means adding more nodes or servers to the network, rather than upgrading individual servers, to distribute the bandwidth and increase capacity.",
            "ability is reached by scaling out, not scaling up. It is the equivalent not of upgrading your server but of putting an extra server next to it to spread the bandwidth around.\nDecentralization is achieved by making mining and staking accessible for everyone through extremely low hardware requirements. This naturally creates a large number of miners and nodes (stakers), making the network robust against attacks of all sorts.\nHigh security is not only reached through the decentralized nature of the network but also because of the Fee Pool and the fact that all operations are directly connected to consensus and thus the miners and stakers.\nNow is the Time to Build with Verus\nWithout having to rely on smart contracts, builders can develop dApps that are even more powerful, secure and scalable. Builders can use the no-coding-required API commands, together with VerusID and its VDXF (Verus Data Exchange Format) as a controlled public storage system with multiple levels of nesting to create dApps of any kind.\nThe foundation has been laid for a true Internet of Value.
