            "Verus reserve tokens on a PBaaS chain can be converted to the native coin at any time without waiting for notarization and cross-chain transactions. They can also be used similarly to a native coin in a wallet. Additionally, they can be sent back to the Verus chain and auto-converted to Verus along the way.",

Any fractional reserve currency can also be sent back to the Verus chain and auto-converted to Verus along the way. Even when sending Verus reserve tokens on a fractional reserve blockchain with its own native currency, symbol, and project, no explicit conversion or Gas is needed to prevent DoS attacks from flooding a chain with transactions. In fact, when Verus reserve token is sent from one transaction to another on a PBaaS reserve chain, network fees are automatically paid in Verus, which is converted on the fly to the native currency of the chain.\nVerus fractional reserve currencies will have decentralized capabilities and benefits that are fundamentally new both to crypto and also to historical human money. Some are described above and the power of those capabilities will be evident if given some thought, but there are also some very deep concepts that I\u2019d like to at least touch on before getting back to the code.\nThe Verus PBaaS protocol will allow fully community funded fairly-launched reserve currency projects, corporate currencies, and more, that all share liquidity with the rest of the entire Verus ecosystem.\nOne major benefit of the protocol is that across the entire multi-blockchain network of reserve currencies, all liquidity is fully shared and grows as the network grows and is used. The value of a currency going up and down will depend much less on how thin an order book is and much more on its fundamentally recognized value.
