            "On Verus, launching a new multi-reserve currency is a risk-less and permission-less process. A user can do this by using the definecurrency API or through a few clicks on the wallet GUI. This process allows for the easy creation of new currencies, tokens, and projects, which can then set up community liquidity and bootstrap it to a level commensurate with their size.",

As discussed above, liquidity will come from investors using multi-reserves as novel investment vehicles, from system liquidity (where continuous use begets its own liquidity), and from novel probabilistic arbitrage strategies which may result in staying \u201cinvested\u201d in multi-reserves for multi-block periods.

            "What is the Verus community's approach to DeFi (Decentralized Finance), and how does it differ from traditional yield farming?",
            "The Verus community believes in a user-centric DeFi approach, where community-driven liquidity emerges under near-zero-cost conditions. This approach focuses on providing the lowest friction, lowest cost, and lowest risk conversion transactions for the crypto and wider financial communities. Unlike traditional yield farming, Verus' approach does not rely solely on yield farming to drive liquidity, but instead leverages multi-reserves as novel investment vehicles, system liquidity, and novel probabilistic arbitrage strategies.",
