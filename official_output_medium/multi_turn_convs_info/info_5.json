            "Part 4 \u2014 Optional: Become a \u2018Hans Solo\u2019\u2026Miner That Is!\nPool mining is a great way to participate in the distributed securing of a blockchain while earning rewards often sooner and more regularly than \u201csolo mining\u201d. Whether solo or pool mining however, ultimately the results should be about the same as far as coins earned.\nSolo Mining doesn\u2019t have to be \u201csolo\u201d either! You can split your computer power, mining solo AND pool simultaneously.
