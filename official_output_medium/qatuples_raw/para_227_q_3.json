    "How can I check the current supply of a currency (e.g., VGG) on the Verus network?",
    "To check the current supply of a currency, you can use the `getcurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency \u201cvgg\u201d\n```\n\nThis command will display the current supply of the VGG currency.",
    "ns, according to how much gold the company has in custody.\nMinting and burning\nSay a customer put 10,000 ounces of gold into the custody of the company. Now let\u2019s make sure the customer gets that amount of VGG into their wallet.\nWe mint 10,000 VGG with this simple command:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"VGG@\" '[{\n \"address\":\"Customer1@\", \n \"currency\":\"VGG\", \n \"mintnew\":1, \n \"amount\":10000\n}]'\nVGG@ is the change-address, Customer1@ is the address where the 10,000 VGG are minted to.\nThe second signer needs to do signrawtransaction and sendrawtransaction, as we have done before, to actually mint the tokens into Customer1@.\nNow, if someone wants to redeem their VGG for gold again, we need to be able to burn that amount from the supply of VGG. We burn with the following command:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"VGG@\" '[{\n \"address\":\"VGG@\", \n \"currency\": \"VGG\", \n \"amount\": 5000, \n \"burn\":true\n}]' \nTo make it happen, the second signer needs to sign off on it again.\nIf we want to check to see the supply of the currency, we can do the following command:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency \u201cvgg\u201d\nUse VGG in Many Ways\nThis article showcased a simple example of how a business can function using the Verus protocol. What we can do with the network goes far beyond what is possible using current blockchain protocols. And all of that without any programming needed!\nWe can also easily export the VGG token to Ethereum as an ERC-20. It can also become one of the reserves in a multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM (automated market maker) as part of Verus DeFi.\nAnybody can define a multi-reserve currency which includes VGG as a reserve with weighted percentage (10\u201390%). The reserves grow as they retain a small fee whenever assets are traded in/out/through.\nA multi-reserve currency itself can also be used as one of the reserves in another multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM ",
