    "What are the core capabilities of Verus, and how do they enable decentralized applications and services?",
    "The core capabilities of Verus include the Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) and VerusID Content Multimaps. The VIP protocol is a fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology that enables secure and private communication between different chains and networks. VerusID Content Multimaps, on the other hand, provide unlimited provable data for every VerusID, ensuring maximum security and flexibility for identity management.",
    "every project, chain and currency on the PBaaS network and EVERY ERC20 or ERC721 on Ethereum or even bridged to Ethereum, the truth of Verus will be self-evident, and those who build on Verus will more easily build faster, better, more secure apps and services with the possibility of provable identity + privacy, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts all seamlessly integrated into UIs that do not need business deals, permission, or any centralized infrastructure to connect services and users, enabling everyone to communicate in provable, private, or public ways that always include bidirectional, secure commerce of all kinds.\nCore Capabilities\nThe core capabilities of this release include (lots to learn to understand it all, but here\u2019s a partial list):\nVerus Internet Protocol (VIP) \u2014 Layer 0 Multichain and Inter-chain Protocol\nTo our knowledge, the VIP protocol is the only fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology available on any network that is based on cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state. From what we\u2019ve been able to learn about LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, Thorchain or others, VIP is different from (though closest in some ways to LayerZero), superior to, and more decentralized than all other cross-chain protocols we have seen. We can of course get into any level of discussion on the topic, but expect more descriptions and educational material to follow, now that the protocol was originally conceived of 5 years ago, and has been developed and tested/hardened for years.\nVerusID Content Multimaps \u2014 Unlimited Provable Data for Every VerusID\nOf course this upgrade retains all of the groundbreaking capabilities already available with VerusID, including multisig options, separate revocation and recovery authorities for maximum security to prevent theft of identity or funds, an",
