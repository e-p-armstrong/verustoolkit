    "How can a user interface (UI) help with using authorities in Verus?",
    "A user interface (UI) can provide instructions and clearly labeled controls that make authorities easy to use, so users don't have to think about complex concepts like 'authorities'.",
    "ig problems with private keys are 1) having them stolen and 2) losing them. Verus helps with both.\nTo Protect Against Theft\nAssign revocation and recovery authorities to an address that you can protect. For example, you might assign them to an address you created with a paper wallet. It won\u2019t be compromised electronically because it\u2019ll never have been on the network.\nLock the ID that\u2019s on the network and set a time period before it unlocks. If a request to unlock that ID appears on the blockchain, revoke the primary authority and recover it to a different ID.\nTo Protect Against Losing an ID\nAnd if you happen to lose the paper on which you wrote down your revocation and recovery ID, Verus can help with that too:\nFirst, request an unlock on the ID that holds your funds (the one that your revocation and recovery ID was protecting).\nWhile you\u2019re waiting for the unlock, create two additional IDs. (Say Bobby@ and Allison@.)\nWhen the coins unlock, send them to one of the new IDs (e.g., Bobby@). Then assign revocation and recovery for that ID to the other ID (e.g., assigned revocation and recovery for Bobby@ to Allison@). Your funds are usable and protected again.\nUI Versus Capability\nUsers may not want to think about concepts like \u2018authorities.\u2019 A user interface (UI), can provide instructions and clearly labeled controls that make authorities easy to use. The Verus community is already working on UI solutions. Maybe you should join us.\nThere\u2019s More\nTogether, VerusIDs and the three authorities improve and enable basic scenarios. But Verus is doing additional fundamental work at the protocol level. For example, you can assigned the three authorities to multiple IDs (e.g., five different IDs, or seven). Doing so can help with scenarios such as estate planning. Keep an eye out for articles on this and other scenarios.\n**\n\u00b7 There\u2019s a Verus channel on Medium with a lot more inform",
