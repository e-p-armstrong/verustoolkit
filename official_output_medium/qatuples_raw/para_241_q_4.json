    "What benefits does the Verus Protocol offer to individuals, projects, organizations, or communities looking to create decentralized solutions?",
    "The Verus Protocol provides an easy-to-use, reliable, decentralized, rent-free platform for creating currencies, fundraising platforms, voting networks, automated accounting systems, self-sovereign identities, and governance models, without requiring programming knowledge.",
    "seven finalists for the Future Horizons event. The Verus PBaaS upgrade will extend the Verus mainnet protocol, which currently features the first and only core primitive of a revocable, recoverable and provable yet private identity and peer to peer marketplace technology adding a decentralized, multi-chain, multi-currency protocol for launching currencies, independent and connected blockchains, and performing fully decentralized, on chain exchanges of currencies, IDs, legal contracts, and more.\nMichael Toutonghi presents the Verus Protocol\nHistory of The Verus Protocol\nThe Verus Protocol went live on its mainnet, which is a public, decentralized blockchain, in 2018 with a vision of Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) powering scalable, autochains and applications through staking and mining, as outlined in the Verus Vision paper. The Protocol launched with no ICO, no preallocation of funds, and no development fee, or middlemen built into the protocol. The worldwide community built the Verus Protocol to offer both transparent and zero knowledge privacy, and as an improvement to the Bitcoin consensus algorithm, a more ecologically efficient consensus protocol. Verus was the first and is still the only blockchain protocol with self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable, and interoperable addresses and privacy enhanced identities built into the core.\nAny individual, project, organization or community needing an easy to use, reliable, decentralized, rent-free currency or fundraising platform, voting network, automated accounting system, self-sovereign, revocable/recoverable identity, or governance model can connect to the Verus Internet of Value and get started without programming. Solutions that used to take weeks or longer to design and code with programmers can now be done by domain experts, better, faster and more securely than before.\nWith the Verus\u2019s Protocol, challen",
