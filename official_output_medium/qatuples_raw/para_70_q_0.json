    "How does the Verus notarization process work, and what is its purpose?",
    "In the Verus notarization process, a stateroot from Ethereum that is at least 30 blocks old is included. This ensures that the stateroot is stable. After Verus confirms the notarization with a new one, Verus can accept transactions (CCE) from Ethereum, along with the Ethereum Merkle Patricia Trie proof that relates to the new confirmed data. The purpose of this process is to provide a secure and decentralized way to facilitate cross-chain transactions between Verus and Ethereum.",
    "ny miner and staker can, and thus also get part of the fees.\nNotarizations made on Verus always contain a stateroot from Ethereum that is a minimum of 30 blocks old (blocks on Ethereum take ~15 seconds) to make sure it is stable. Then after Verus has confirmed the notarization with a new one, Verus can accept transactions (CCE) from Ethereum, along with the Ethereum Merkle Patricia Trie proof that relates to the new confirmed data.\nA Giant Leap Forward\nThe delayed sending of transactions is an important security mechanism that is not present in any other cross-chain bridge. To recap: before any real transactions happen, the Verus network sends proofs to the Ethereum network and vice versa. These proofs are checked and agreed upon by everyone in the network. Only then the actual moving of assets happens. Because of this delayed system, no single entity ever gets control over the assets. Also there are safeguards in place for the community notaries that protect users from hacks.\nThis system is decentralized, which means it\u2019s controlled by everyone participating in the network, rather than a single central authority. It\u2019s a giant leap forward for the entire cryptocurrency industry, and everyone can be a part of it!\nJoin the community. Learn about the protocol.
