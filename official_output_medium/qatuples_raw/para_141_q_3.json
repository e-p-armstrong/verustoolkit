    "What is the advantage of exporting launched currencies to Ethereum as ERC-20 tokens on Verus?",
    "The advantage of exporting launched currencies to Ethereum as ERC-20 tokens on Verus is that these currencies can then participate in the Ethereum ecosystem, while still benefiting from better security and cheaper DeFi transactions than if they were created on Ethereum itself. Additionally, each ERC-20 token can also be bridged back to Verus, making it easy to move assets between the two ecosystems.",
    "nd account-based protocols (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche) currencies are not part of consensus and thus easily exploitable by smart contract bugs and malicious developers. With Verus, a UTXO model, all currencies are accounted for, and verified by the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, making it as secure as sending BTC on Bitcoin. To make it simple \u2014 all features on the Verus Protocol are on the first layer, the consensus layer.\nVerus fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape\nAlso, where other protocols need L2 solutions which are mostly centralized, Verus includes self-sovereign identities, namespaces, privacy, DeFi, bridges, and currency and blockchain launches on the first layer. An innovation that fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape.\nLaunching currencies with Verus is also much faster and cheaper than with the alternatives. The magic here is that there is no coding involved. Anyone can launch a currency by just choosing the options and parameters they would like. It is as easy as typing in a command and the currency is ready to be used by the world within minutes. This process does not involve expensive Solidity developers or security audits, saving a lot of development costs.\nAnother big advantage is being able to export launched currencies to Ethereum as ERC-20. These currencies can then partake in the Ethereum ecosystem, yet have better security and cheaper DeFi transactions than when they are created on Ethereum itself. Each ERC-20 token can also be bridged to Verus. It\u2019s all super easy thanks to the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge.\nThis is not all some fantasy, this is all functional (the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is in testing), right now, on mainnet, on the Verus Protocol. As you now know, Verus is built fundamentally differently than any other protocol out there, ",
