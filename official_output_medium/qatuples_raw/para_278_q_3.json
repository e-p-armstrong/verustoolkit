    "What is the minimum reward for reporting a security-related bug or exploit in the Verus protocol?",
    "The minimum reward for reporting a security-related bug or exploit in the Verus protocol is 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 VRSC.",
    "transfer transactions, but to determine when a block is the last of the prior export or first in the next requires a random bit pulled from later blocks.\nThe last miner or staker to complete a block of an export retroactively receives 10% of all fees from processing that export, including all conversions, once the rollup is processed as an import. This reward used to go to the miner or staker who processes the export, which is no longer the case.\nImport transactions can now include up to n/2 arbitrage transactions, where n is the number of reserves in a liquidity basket currency.\nThese changes together serve to disincentivize any miner or staker from attempting to exclude a large set of transactions from a block and front run all of them, as they will have an even chance of having all of those excluded transactions put back in with their transaction, turning potential gain into potential loss. They would be better off saving their working capital to arbitrage imports by joining transactions, bringing them close to market, and earning money without risk of loss. In addition, if they do end up putting more value of transactions in a block that caps the export rollup, they will reliably earn meaningful rewards without risk of loss in that way as well.\nBug Bounties \ud83d\udcb0\nWhile we don\u2019t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended.\nIf anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 VRSC.\n\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f See",
