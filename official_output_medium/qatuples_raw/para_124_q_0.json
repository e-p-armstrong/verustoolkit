    "What is a VerusID Profile, and what features does it have?",
    "A VerusID Profile is a personalized profile that showcases the capabilities of VerusID and Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF). It allows users to create a profile that contains various types of content, such as images, videos, posts, and proofs of ownership of social media accounts, websites, or crypto addresses. The user has full control over their profile and cannot be deplatformed. The profile's data is stored on a decentralized storage provider, such as Arweave, with the option to use other storage providers as well.",
