    "How does Verus's decentralized protocol impact its security?",
    "Verus's naturally decentralized protocol, combined with its proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms, makes it extremely secure and resistant to 51% hash attacks. This security is inherited by PBaaS-chains, which also benefit from merge-mining with up to 21 chains.",
    "that are old or with broken screens. Thus significantly reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW mining.\nThen we have the proof-of-stake part of the consensus mechanism. This one is really simple and powerful. Anyone can run a node and start staking. There is no minimum amount of VRSC needed (pretty unique in the world of PoS). Verus solved the \u201cnothing-at-stake\u201d-problem therefore there is no slashing of funds. Funds staking are never locked and running a node can be done with something as cheap as a Raspberry Pi 4. All-in-all proving yet again that Verus is accessible to everyone, creating a naturally decentralized protocol.\nWe can conclude that Verus is truly a decentralized protocol, naturally emerging from its extremely low-barrier mining and staking. So what does that mean for security?\nProtocol Security at Another Level\nSeeing as the Verus Protocol is naturally decentralized and provable 51% hash attack resistant, it\u2019s extremely secure. PBaaS-chains take these properties with them as they have the same consensus mechanism, and the Verus miners can choose up to 21 of them to merge-mine. It\u2019s fair to say that there is no compromise on security given the scalability of the protocol.\nVerus Introduces the Fee Pool\nLet\u2019s first explain the fees the protocol generates for the miners and stakers:\nPBaaS-chain launches: 10,000 VRSC (5,000 for the block producers of Verus, 5,000 for the block producers of the newly launched chain)\nCurrency launches (tokens, basket currencies, liquidity pools, ERC-20 mapped currencies): 200 VRSC\nVerusID registrations: 100, 80, 60, 40 or 20 VRSC\nsubID registrations: 0.02 VRSC\nDeFi conversion fees: min. 0.0125%, max. 0.025%\nTransaction fees: 0.0001 VRSC\nBuilders and users pay these protocol fees for their operations and the fees are directed into the Fee Pool. Then, for each new block, 1% of the Fee Pool is added on to",
