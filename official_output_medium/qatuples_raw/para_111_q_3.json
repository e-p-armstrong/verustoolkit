    "How do the conversion possibilities work in the Verus DeFi ecosystem?",
    "In the Verus DeFi ecosystem, if one wants to convert from one reserve currency to another, the protocol searches through all the fractional currencies with both currencies in its reserves and presents the best available price for the conversion. This allows for conversions in every direction, providing more flexibility and options for users.",
    "backed 100%. In the Verus ecosystem, we can have fractional currencies that are partially, fractionally, backed by a number between 5 and 95%, see image 5.\nImage 5: Two examples of fractional currencies that are partially backed by its reserves\nHow one creates 100% backed or partially backed fractional currencies differs. A user can create a currency and define that the currency is 100% backed. A user can not define the fraction between 5 and 95%. The number of backing by a fractional currency is dependent upon market forces before the currency is launched.\nOne can ask, what is the consequence that a currency is backed by 10, 50, 80 or 100%? The difference is the curve of price vs supply. And remember, the fractional currencies have adaptive supplies. See image 6 for a simplified illustration.\nImage 6: Different backing percentage means different price vs supply curve\nConverting From Reserve to Reserve\nWe have explained how one can always convert to a fractional currency with its reserve currencies. Or back to a reserve currency with the fractional currency. In the Verus ecosystem there is another way to convert currencies.\nWe call this converting through the fractional currency. One doesn\u2019t acquire the fractional currency, but converts through the fractional currency to a reserve currency. To simplify: one converts one reserve currency to another reserve currency. See image 7 for the different conversion possibilities within our NewCurrency example. Remember that all the currencies (fractional & reserves) have a value relative to each other.\nImage 7: Possibility to convert in every direction\nFor example, if one owns VRSC, they can convert it to ETH through NewCurrency. In the Verus DeFi ecosystem, if one wants to convert VRSC to ETH, the protocol searches through all the fractional currencies with both VRSC and ETH in its reserves, presenting you the best price for c",
