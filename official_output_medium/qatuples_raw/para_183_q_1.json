    "What is the current status of these capabilities on Verus, and how can communities start using them?",
    "All of these capabilities currently exist in the Verus protocols and are being tested on the testnet. A mainnet activation is planned, and communities will soon be able to experiment with these capabilities at their own pace. While additional software development is needed to make some of these elements easy and safe to use for the broader community, communities can start working with the Verus developer community to create open-source apps that leverage these protocols.",
    "Conclusions\nThese are new blockchain capabilities. They do not currently exist on Ethereum or other smart contract blockchains because the interplay of such different elements would seem to create overwhelming complexity, requiring the use of multiple inter-operating contracts to implement. Certainly, such comprehensive and flexible solutions could not be carried out in minutes through the use of a few simple commands.\nCurrently, all of these capabilities exist in the Verus protocols and are in use on testnet. A mainnet activation is imminent, and communities can soon start to experiment, at the smallest initial scales they desire. It\u2019s important to note, however, that additional software development would be required to make some of these elements easy and safe to use for the broader community. As a FOSS project, Verus encourages communities to work together, and with the Verus developer community to create open source apps that leverage the protocols, so that all communities worldwide can benefit from the resulting development.\nDiscuss and explore all Verus has to offer on Discord\nFollow on Twitter\nGo to verus.io",
