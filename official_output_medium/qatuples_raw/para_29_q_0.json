    "What is the significance of Satoshi Nakamoto's 10-year prophecy in relation to electronic currency?",
    "Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, made a prophecy in an email on January 16, 2009, stating that he would be surprised if electronic currency was not being used in some way 10 years later. This prophecy highlights the potential for electronic currencies to become a mainstream means of exchange.",

Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications for services that could almost be free but not quite.\nIt can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail. The send dialog is resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like. It\u2019s sent directly when it connects. The recipient doubleclicks on the transaction to see the full message. If someone famous is getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and give out the IP address on their website. \u201cSend X bitcoins to my priority hotline at this IP and I\u2019ll read the message personally.\u201d\nSubscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their free trial so it doesn\u2019t cannibalize subscriptions could charge bitcoins for the trial.\nIt might make sense ",
