    "What are the differences in security considerations between auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options in the Verus protocol?",
    "Auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options have different security considerations. Auto-notarization enhances proof root determination but is not dependent on multisig agreement of notary witnesses, whereas notary-confirm requires the honest participation of a majority of notary witnesses, allowing for further decentralization. The choice between these options depends on the network's security demands and requires careful planning and selection of options, witness ID structure, and additional safeguards.",
    "ions as part of the merge mining or staking process, confirm other notarizations entered by past validators, and a majority of notaries sign and witness their recognition of those events, a proof root that can be used by anyone to prove committed bundles of cross-chain transactions is established on both systems for the other. As the protocol ensures via cryptographic proof validation that the cross-chain bundles are the exact bundles in the order they were packaged on the source system, importing cross-chain transaction bundles is a permissionless operation that anyone, usually a validator, can perform, which relies on the proof established in relation to a confirmed, notarized proof root.\nDo auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options have different security considerations?\nYes. Proper planning and selection of options and witness ID structure during the launch of a blockchain network or gateway can ensure that security levels meet network demands. There are security tradeoffs between auto-notarization and notary-confirm options, which basically are a tradeoff between a permissionless model where proof root determination is enhanced, but not dependent upon multisig agreement of notary witnesses, auto-notarization vs. a model where establishing any cross-network cryptographic proof root requires the honest participation of a majority of the notary witnesses, which can be represented by revocable and recoverable IDs, allowing for further decentralization, even while requiring participation of a quorum.\nDetermining which option to choose, how many and what notaries to choose, what other safeguards can further enhance security, and then understanding the resulting security profile from each set of choices, is important when launching a blockchain or gateway. The following outlines the current high-level security considerations when configuring a new chain ",
