    "Can witnesses/notaries create notarizations or censor transactions in Verus?",
    "No, witnesses/notaries cannot create notarizations or censor transactions in Verus. They can only witness the validity of notarizations already created and agreed to by both proof of work and proof of stake validators.",
    "ndles of transactions exported from one chain or system and imported to another. Even Ethereum transactions are proven in both directions using the same workflow, although Ethereum transactions are validated using PATRICIA Trie proofs, while PBaaS chains use the Verus Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) method, both being cryptographically sound. Cross-chain bundles of transactions follow the same bundling protocol when sourced from Verus or PBaaS chains as is followed in DeFi to prevent MEV.\nTransactions are always delivered to the destination network with bundles in the order they were created on the source network and according to the enforceable rules of the source network. Since a relayer may add arbitrage transactions when the destination is a PBaaS chain, but may not affect the provable source contents of a relayed bundle from one network to another, no restriction is placed on who relays a valid bundle of transactions. Since validators who relay and mine or stake transaction bundles into a block may earn a validation fee from the import transaction itself, validators or notaries will generally shuttle transaction bundles between chains and networks out of self interest, while having no ability whatsoever to censor or modify protocol level bundles.\nWhat witness / notaries do NOT do\nWitnesses / notaries have no control over what transactions are or are not included or the order in which they arrive from one system to another, as all of that is dictated by the protocol. By default, notaries cannot create notarizations and can only witness the validity of notarizations already created and agreed to by both proof of work and proof of stake validators.\nWitness notaries\u2019 primary role is to agree or disagree with the network validators\u2019 earned notarizations, which are earned on one blockchain and accepted on another chain or system. As long as validators enter valid notarizat",
