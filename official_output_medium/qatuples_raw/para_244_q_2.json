    "Title: Verus Beginner\u2019s Staking Guide\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-beginners-staking-guide-efbbdc4de951\nContent:Verus Beginner\u2019s Staking GuideThe Basics\nVerus is among the easiest cryptocurrencies to stake and earn rewards. Unlike many staking systems your Verus is completely accessible while it\u2019s staking, it isn\u2019t locked up, inaccessible, or out of your control in any way. You just have to flip a switch in your wallet to turn it on, and your Verus remains in your wallet the whole time, and can be spent at any time.\nVerus uses a novel consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Power (PoP) which is a hybrid half Proof-of-Work (PoW), half Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system. Half of the blocks are mined using VerusHash, and the other half are \u201cminted\u201d via staking. This means that both miners and stakers are doing the work to process transactions and secure the network, and that attackers would need BOTH a significant share of mining hash rate AND of the available supply of Verus (VRSC) to attack the network.\nEvery block has a chance of being won by staking, and over time it averages out that half of the blocks are solved by mining and half by staking. The average block time on Verus is 1 minute. If you stake a block you\u2019ll get the block reward and any transaction fees paid by users to have their transactions processed. At the time of writing, the block reward is 12 VRSC, and there is a halving (the reward drops in half) approximately every two years, the last of which was in November 2020.\nThe chances of staking and receiving a block reward for any given block are proportional to the amount of Verus you\u2019re staking. There is no minimum amount of Verus required to stake, and any funds kept in a transparent address or a VerusID that have been there for at least 150 blocks (about 150 minutes) may be used to stake.\nYour wallet must be running, connected to the internet, ",
