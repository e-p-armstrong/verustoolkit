    "How does the Verus-Ethereum bridge work, and what is the process for moving or converting assets from Verus to Ethereum?",
    "The Verus-Ethereum bridge works by recording transactions on the Verus blockchain. When a user wants to move or convert assets from Verus to Ethereum, the transaction is recorded on the Verus blockchain. The Bridgekeeper program then facilitates the communication between the two blockchains, allowing the assets to be transferred or converted.",
    "here on how the Verus Protocol handles cross-chain communication (PBaaS-chains and more) in a decentralized and provable way.\nSafeguards Against Bridge Hacks\nThreats caused by malicious notary witnesses, or stolen keys to drain funds are not viable against the Verus-Ethereum bridge. To successfully mount an attack on the bridge, if a majority of witnesses were colluding or got their private keys stolen the following would need to happen:\nColluding, malicious witnesses.\nFake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain.\nDevelopers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow chain.\nThese requirements are very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain. The bridge even provides a way to defend against such an unlikely scenario.\nThe notary witnesses are also monitoring notarizations, and if they were to sign for something that they themselves do not agree with, they can auto-revoke their identities, using the VerusID protocol, which cannot be stopped by an attacker unless they have stolen both the keys for the notary ID and those for its revocation ID as well. This serves as a prevention for stolen key attacks, ensuring that notaries are extremely hard targets to compromise.\nBridgekeeper\nThe two blockchains, Verus and Ethereum, are fundamentally different from each other, but still need to be able to communicate. A translator is needed. This translator is a program called Bridgekeeper. Notary witnesses have to run the program. Miners and stakers are also encouraged to run it, and for doing so they receive fees.\nBridgekeeper for CLI / How to become a Bridgekeeper \u2014 video\nVerus \u27a1\ufe0f Ethereum\nLet\u2019s consider a scenario where a user wants to move or convert assets from Verus to Ethereum.
