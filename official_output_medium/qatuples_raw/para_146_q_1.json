    "What happens to subID registration fees when a decentralized currency (with \"proofprotocol\" set to 1) is launched?",
    "When a decentralized currency (with \"proofprotocol\" set to 1) is launched, the subID registration fees are burned.",
    "o let\u2019s start.\n\u201cproofprotocol\u201d\nThis parameter defines, among others, if the currency is centralized or decentralized. You can choose 1,2 or 3.\n1 is default, which launches a decentralized currency (no need to include this parameter when defining such a currency). When subIDs are created with this option, the registration fees are burned.\n2 is for a centralized currency. If it\u2019s a basket currency the rootID can mint and burn supply while automatically lowering and raising the reserve ratio (also anyone can burn supply without lowering the reserve ratio). Or when it\u2019s a simple token currency they can just mint and burn supply. The subID registration fees go to the rootID.\n3 is for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens.

In the case of a simple token currency, combine it with \"conversions\" to determine the preconversion price.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"CommunityX\", \n \"options\":33, \n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\",\"MyBrand\"], \n \"minpreconversion\":[10,50],\n \"initialsupply\":100\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d A basket currency called CommunityX. It needs to get a minimum of 10 VRSCTEST and 50 MyBrand into its reserves within the preconversion time frame to be launched. The initial supply of 100 CommunityX will be distributed among the preconverters.\n",
