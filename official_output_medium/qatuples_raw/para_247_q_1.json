    "How can I check my current staking and mining status in Verus?",
    "You can check your current staking and mining status in Verus using the command `verus getmininginfo`. This will return a JSON object with information about your mining status, including the current block size, difficulty, staking supply, and more.",
    "ou want to mine with.\nYou can disable staking AND mining using:\nverus setgenerate false\nYou can get your current staking/mining status using:\nverus getmininginfo\nwhich will return something like this:\n{ \n \u201cblocks\u201d: 1424603,\n \u201ccurrentblocksize\u201d: 0,\n \u201ccurrentblocktx\u201d: 0,\n \u201caverageblockfees\u201d: 1.20011909,\n \u201cdifficulty\u201d: 1004965568496.515,\n \u201cstakingsupply\u201d: 41243165.47632869,\n \u201cerrors\u201d: \u201c\u201d,\n \u201cgenproclimit\u201d: 0,\n \u201clocalhashps\u201d: 0,\n \u201cnetworkhashps\u201d: 351834027116,\n \u201cpooledtx\u201d: 1,\n \u201ctestnet\u201d: false,\n \u201cchain\u201d: \u201cmain\u201d,\n \u201cgenerate\u201d: true,\n \u201cstaking\u201d: true,\n \u201cnumthreads\u201d: 0,\n \u201cmergemining\u201d: 0\n}\nThe \u201cstakingsupply\u201d figure is an estimate of how much Verus has been staking on the whole network recently. Your approximate chances of staking any given block can be calculated by dividing your eligible staking balance (funds at least 150 blocks old in transparent addresses or IDs) by the staking supply.\nTo enable staking after verusd is restarted you can add the following to your VRSC.conf file:\nmint=1\nor pass -mint to verusd when launching it.\nEnabling StakeGuard\nStakeGuard is a system for solving the Nothing-at-Stake problem. By configuring StakeGuard you have a chance of receiving the ill-gotten staking rewards from those who are trying to cheat the network (or potentially from those who make the mistake of staking their wallet from different computers at the same time, since the network can\u2019t tell these two cases apart).\nTo enable StakeGuard on the Verus Desktop GUI go to the main wallet screen for Verus and click the green Receive button under Private Balance. Then click the copy icon for an address you\u2019d like your StakeGuard proceeds to go to. If you don\u2019t yet have a private address, click the \u201cnew private address\u201d button.",
