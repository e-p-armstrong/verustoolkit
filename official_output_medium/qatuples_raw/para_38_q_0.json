    "What is the Verus-Ethereum bridge, and what are its key features?",
    "The Verus-Ethereum bridge is a groundbreaking, non-custodial, and provable bridge that allows for the transfer of tokens and currencies between the Verus and Ethereum blockchains. It is permissionless, meaning that anyone can use it without needing permission from a central authority. The bridge ensures that tokens and currencies flowing over it are never in anyone's custody and are proven and verified by consensus rules.",
    "Title: Get Ahead of the Game with Verus\u2019 Groundbreaking 1:1 Decentralized Currency Mapping for ERC-20\u2026\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/get-ahead-of-the-game-with-verus-groundbreaking-1-1-decentralized-currency-mapping-for-erc-20-cc23584a7037\nContent:Get Ahead of the Game with Verus\u2019 Groundbreaking 1:1 Decentralized Currency Mapping for ERC-20 Tokens\nIn this article, we show you how to map and bridge an Ethereum ERC-20 token to the Verus testnet blockchain as a currency one-to-one. We use the groundbreaking non-custodial and provable Verus-Ethereum bridge, and we don\u2019t even need to code anything!\ud83d\udcdd Note that this walkthrough is for the Verus Testnet blockchain, which simulates the Verus blockchain once the PBaaS-upgrade (Public Blockchains as a Service) is brought to mainnet. Also, the commands are for macOS and Linux, as Windows works a bit differently. We use the CLI wallet for Verus. Download here \ud83d\udd17 You can also use Verus Desktop with its incorporated terminal.\nThe Verus-Ethereum Bridge\n\ud83d\udc49 All tokens and currencies flowing over the bridge are never in anyone\u2019s custody, and are proven and verified by consensus rules.\nThe Verus-Ethereum bridge is the first of its kind. Because it is permissionless, non-custodial and provable. We can:\nsend and receive ETH and ERC-20s to and from Verus and Ethereum\nsend and receive currencies launched on Verus to and from Ethereum\nconvert currencies through the bridge converter currency. Use on Ethereum as well as on Verus. Learn more on bridge converter currencies \ud83d\udd17\nDefining a Currency\nDefining a currency on the Verus network is simple, just two commands are all you need. When the currency is successfully launched it can flow around within the protocol, and outside of the protocol (like an ERC-20, in our example). Let\u2019s get started.\nVerusID NamespaceBefore defining the currency, we already registered the VerusID MaxUSDC@. This ",
