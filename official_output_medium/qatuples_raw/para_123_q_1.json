    "How does the Verus Fee Pool work, and what are its benefits?",
    "The Verus Fee Pool is a solution that enables a blockchain economy by requiring miners to put all fees into a pool and then take a fraction of the pool as their fee reward. This approach ensures that it is always more efficient to continue mining forward, as any large sum of fees will be distributed with exponential decay over the current and future blocks. The benefits of the Verus Fee Pool include preventing miners from having perverse incentives to reorganize the blockchain and providing a more secure and efficient consensus protocol.",
    "r other functions earning fees are completely separate from the blockchain consensus protocol, as is the case in Ethereum and most other VM-centric systems, miners and stakers often have perverse incentives to reorg the blockchain and capture the blocks with unusually large fees, even after they have been mined by another. The Verus developers consider this a fundamental security flaw in the consensus protocol and are introducing the Verus Fee Pool, which will be operable on all PBaaS chains as well.\nThe Verus fee pool is a complete solution to enabling a blockchain economy and works by simply requiring that miners put all fees into the fee pool and then take a fraction of the fee pool as their fee reward. This way, it is always more efficient to continue mining forward, as any large sum of fees will be distributed with exponential decay over the current and future blocks. In addition to the Verus Fee Pool, fees for conversions may be paid in the source currency and are automatically converted to Verus or the native blockchain currency on a PBaaS chain before being exposed to miners as transaction fees, providing an entirely new and complete solution to both the problems of large fee disruptions and integration of DeFi conversions into the consensus security protocol.\nWritten by miketout & michaeltoutjr\nJoin the New Era of Crypto\nDiscuss and share ideas on your own blockchain or currency project, or if you need help come to our Discord server.
