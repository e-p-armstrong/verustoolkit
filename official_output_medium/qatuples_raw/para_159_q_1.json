    "What makes Verus a highly decentralized platform?",
    "Verus is highly decentralized due to its DNA, which is designed to be ASIC-resistant and has a low mining barrier. This is achieved through its CPU hash algorithm, which makes it accessible to a wide range of users. Additionally, Verus has a 50% Proof of Work and 50% Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, which allows users to participate in the network and contribute to its security.",
    "Title: #2 Ben\u2019s Pocket Guide to Verus Coin for Dummies And Smart People Too.\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/a-pocket-guide-to-verus-coin-f0c86e976c33\nContent:Verus virtus potest esse emit / True virtue cannot be bought \u2014 anonymous#2 Ben\u2019s Pocket Guide to Verus Coin for Dummies And Smart People Too.\nA brief overview of this extremely decentralized and fairly launched project that takes aim at solving big problems with fake news, trust in election results and voting as well as restoring your privacy when you vote. This post will give you all the reasons you want to mine, stake and be involved with Verus Coin.\nWith Verus, we plan to create a platform upon which we will build voting and even election systems that support our vision of enabling a better society through blockchain. To run simultaneous polls across disparate populations on one blockchain-based system, we need another dimension of information \u2014 one that retains privacy, and is anchored to a primary store of value, Verus.\nFirst Public Blockchains as a Service project (PBaaS).\nFirst fairly mined coin to create a foundation, over 4MM raised through community contributions of mined coins to sustain the long-term vision.\nA fair launch with nothing held back and no pre-mine which means mining started for everyone at the same time.\nThe World\u2019s fastest CPU hash and ASIC resistant right down to it\u2019s DNA, which means maximum decentralization because of the low mining barrier.\n50% Proof of Work and 50% Proof of Stake which means you can put your coins to work mining(make sure to shield and unshield the coins you mine)\nSecured by delayed proof of work. A Friendly fork of Komodo, which means it benefits from delayed proof of work (creates a restore point on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain in case of attack).\nDid not do a ICO or try to raise funds. Solely focused on building working tech.\nCredible. Mike Toutonghi is Lead D",
