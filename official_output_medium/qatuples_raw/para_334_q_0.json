    "What is impermanent loss, and how does Verus counteract it?",
    "Impermanent loss is a mathematical property of automated market makers, where liquidity providers are penalized when the conversion ratios of constituent currencies in a multi-reserve pool diverge from the ratios that prevailed when they entered the pool. Verus counteracts impermanent loss by imposing a standard conversion transaction fee, which is earned and shared by holders of the multi-reserve currency, offering a yield based on the amount of reserve-to-reserve conversion transactions conducted.",
    " loss is a mathematical property of automated market makers, inherent to the mechanisms required to solve new prices as reserves change from block to block. Unattended, it operates to penalize liquidity providers in situations where the conversion ratios of constituent currencies in a multi-reserve pool have diverged from the ratios that prevailed when the provider entered the pool. In the Ethereum VM model, as in Verus, the method to counteract impermanent loss includes the imposition of a standard conversion transaction fee. In Verus, the fee is earned and shared by holders of the multi-reserve currency, thus offering a yield based on the amount of the reserve-to-reserve conversion transactions conducted. In Verus, the fee is currently set at 0.025%, which is significantly lower than similar fees in Ethereum. The Verus community believes this will be more than sufficient to counteract impermanent loss in all but the most extreme cases.\nReduced Costs for Users/Converters\nAs stated multiple times above, the Verus system eliminates common predatory front-running behaviors. This is an endemic problem in Ethereum-based systems, and also in traditional financial markets, where high frequency trading and \u201cflash boys\u201d operate to game value out of the system at the expense of less sophisticated players. In traditional markets, where ordered transactions and serial transaction processing are also a necessary part of the paradigm, exchanges have begun to experiment with \u201cspeed bumps\u201d in order to reduce the advantages of players with more sophisticated infrastructure and superior latency. With the decentralized, parallel transaction processing engine used by Verus nobody can predict the exact timing of the solving block, all transactions included in a block get the same price in all directions, and no single party can reliably control what transactions are or are not processed.",
