    "Why do social token platforms like Roll and Rally have strict requirements for creators?",
    "Roll and Rally have strict requirements for creators because they need to invest significant engineering and development resources to set up and maintain the contracts that define and provide liquidity to social tokens. In return, they take a portion of the creator's token (Roll) or attempt to create value in their own token and sidechain (Rally).",
    "interested in creating a social token is met with an odd reality in the \u201cdecentralized\u201d blockchain world. Both Roll and Rally, the social token leaders, require creators to go through a detailed application process, and then wait for approval. The Rally website says they\u2019re looking for: \u201c1) Evidence of a significant community size, \u2026 2) Evidence of current transaction activity within your community \u2026 3) Evidence that you have strongly considered the role that a social token economy would play in your ongoing projects.\u201d Creators then wait for a review before being approved. Roll\u2019s business model is to take a portion of the creator\u2019s token for themselves. Rally\u2019s is a little more sophisticated, attempting to have value created in their own token and sidechain in the process.\nThis makes sense for Roll and Rally because there is significant engineering and other work required to get the contracts up and running that define the social token and provide it liquidity. Creators who want to \u201cdo it themselves\u201d are met with an arduous and limiting process \u2014 essentially, they need to be decent developers to get their tokens going. And to do all that for a one-dimensional token that can only be sent back and forth or placed in an AMM seems to be an unattractive proposition.\nThe result is that social tokens have yet to fulfill their promise. There\u2019s no easy way for just anyone to do permissionless experiments at little cost, and little risk. And, when they do experiment, there is only the hope that by tying real world activities to their token, they might generate some value there, at least while they continue to offer those activities. This purported value is difficult to measure, and tough to capture, and exhausting to maintain. So there\u2019s no real innovation and no \u201clong tail\u201d that allows unexpected modes of organization and value creation to emerge.\nNew Capabilities\nWhat would i",
