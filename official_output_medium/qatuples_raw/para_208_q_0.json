    "How do I install a Linux distribution on my system in order to mine Verus?",
    "To install a Linux distribution on your system for mining Verus, you can use the `proot-distro` package. First, install `proot-distro` by running the command `pkg install proot-distro`. Then, you can install a supported Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu 20.04, by running the command `proot-distro install ubuntu-20.04`. After installation, you can log in to the distribution by running `proot-distro login ubuntu-20.04`.",
    "by executing.\n`pkg install proot-distro`\nNote: For now it supports these distributions:(Alpine Linux , Arch Linux ,Kali Nethunter , Ubuntu 20.04 ) for this example we are using ubuntu-20.04\nInstall Ubunt By : \u201c proot-distro install ubuntu-20.04 \u201d\nTo login : \u201c proot-distro login ubuntu-20.04`\nUbuntu logIn\nThe picture show that we are logged in ubuntu-20.04\nUpdate system packages: \u201c apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y \u201d\n>all the following instructions can be found on the miner repository.\nInstall additional package and dependencies: \u201c apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libjansson-dev automake autotools-dev build-essential git nano \u201d\nClone ccminer miner repository: \u201c git clone --single-branch -b ARM https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer.git\u201d\nsingle-branch take two dash as in the picture in cas you see or copy past it Wrong. thanks keda666 from verus discord\nThen cd to \u201c ccminer/ \u201d folder and make \u2018build.sh\u2019 , \u2018configure.sh\u2019 and \u2018autogen.sh\u2019 files executable using this command in one line: \u201c chmod +x build.sh && chmod +x configure.sh && chmod +x autogen.sh \u201c\nWe can then execute \u201c ./build.sh \u201d script on the same place and wait for it to compile the miner\nIf it completes successfully edit the \u201c run\u201d file located in ccminer Folder\n\u201c nano run\u201d (HIT Enter)\nChange Pool_url , Mining address and Cpu threads Number ,to save CTRL+x , respond by Y and hit Enter\n./ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://Pool_URL:PORT -u MINING_Address.WORKER_NAME -p x -t THREADS NUMBERS\nIt should look like this :\nedit the \u201c run \u201c file under ccminer folder to feet your needs :D\n< Prevention is better than the cure>\nIts advised to not use all of the cpu threads because mining is an intensive job for the cpu and will cause heat that could damage your device. You can find the number of threads your CPU has on the \u201cCPU(s):\u201d line from lscpu from before. Choose a lower number of threads and monitor",
