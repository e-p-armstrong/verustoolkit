Now, we will use these same technologies used to create trustless and decentralized public blockchain infrastructure that can scale with the usage of the world\u2019s population.\nThe Verus Coin Foundation\u2019s mission will be to support development of automatic blockchain provisioning on the Verus blockchain, enabling dynamic, fully featured side chain creation and no centralized provisioning or point of failure. The Verus Coin Foundation will also support development of decentralized, public applications, powered by the Verus network to change our world for the better by using PBaaS for public services like polls and voting, identity systems, and other systems that can use zero knowledge proofs to respect privacy, while tapping into the whole of human knowledge.\nThe Verus Coin Foundation will soon announce thousands of Verus in community bounties on a regular basis for those members helping to further the Verus vision, so that we may all ",
