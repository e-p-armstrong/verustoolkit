    "Title: Verus Community Discovers Secret FPGA Miners on the Network\u200a\u2014\u200aYou Won\u2019t Believe What Happens Next!\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-community-responds-to-secret-fpga-mining-be5e9ce0eafb\nContent:Verus Community Discovers Secret FPGA Miners on the Network \u2014 You Won\u2019t Believe What Happens Next!\nNumber 8 == Mind Blown!\nThe Discovery of Secret Miners\nJust a few short weeks ago, the CPU and GPU miners of Verus Coin confronted the emerging model of secret FPGA mining, a trend that threatens many proof of work crypto communities. Fortunately, Verus Coin\u2019s proof of power consensus algorithm, a hybrid of proof of work and proof of stake, had just been proven immune to 51% hash attacks, leaving the project more protected than most blockchains in such a scenario.\nAt the same time, with the significant economic advantage that owners of FPGA systems had over CPUs and GPUs for mining, Verus Coin\u2019s hash power quickly centralized to mainly FPGA miners\u2026and die-hard community members who remained dedicated to the ideals of the Verus Project and trusted that the Verus community devs would solve this problem, as they had so many in the past.\nRather than fork to yet another random selection of hash algorithms or the hardest of memory hard solutions to reduce the types of FPGAs that could even run a hash, the Verus Coin community and developers decided to take a completely new approach.\nNow, since we know you\u2019re DYING to find out the mind-blowing answer to number 8, we\u2019ll get right to the point, skip numbers 1 through 7 and go straight to 8!Number 8 (aka What Happened Next!)\nAs soon as FPGAs were confirmed, an immediate and intense effort by community devs and others on everything from the wallet to the pools, to Electrum servers, and exchanges resulted in a brand new and very different hardware equalization algorithm that somehow, the Verus Community managed to activa",
