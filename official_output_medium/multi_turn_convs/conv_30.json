What is STEX.com, and how is it related to VerusCoin?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSTEX.com is an Estonian-based cryptocurrency exchange that has listed VerusCoin (VRSC) for live trading with a VRSC/BTC trading pair.

I'd love to learn more about VerusCoin itself. What are some of the key features of VerusCoin?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusCoin offers several advanced features that set it apart from other cryptocurrencies. For example, it has zero-knowledge privacy through VerusHash, a unique hash algorithm that can be mined on both CPUs and GPUs. It also uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines 50% proof of work and 50% proof of stake, with a nothing-at-stake solution to increase security and reduce power consumption.

They're also working on a multi-coin mobile wallet, which will make it even easier to use VerusCoin on-the-go. The project is committed to providing the tools and resources users need to succeed.",
