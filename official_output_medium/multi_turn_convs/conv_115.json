    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI was wondering, what is the main goal of the Verus development team?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main goal of the Verus development team is to create a decentralized and robust protocol that works seamlessly. They're dedicated to building a reliable and efficient system that benefits the entire Verus community. Do you have any questions about the Verus protocol or its development?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. Can currencies on one PBaaS-blockchain be used on another PBaaS-blockchain, and how does this work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, currencies on one PBaaS-blockchain can be exported to and used on another PBaaS-blockchain. This is done by exporting the currency to the desired blockchain for a fee, which is defined by the PBaaS-chain where the currency is being exported to. The fee can be paid in any currency available in the bridge-converter. So, you can easily move currencies between blockchains without worrying about compatibility issues.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really convenient. How do fees work on PBaaS-blockchains, and what currencies can be used to pay them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn PBaaS-blockchains, fees can be paid using any currency available in the bridge-converter. This means that you don't need to have the native currency of the blockchain to perform transactions. The bridge-converter can automatically convert a small fee of the currency you have to the native currency of the blockchain, which is then used as the transaction fee. It's a pretty seamless process.\n\n**User:**\nSo, the bridge-converter plays a crucial role in all this. What is its significance in the Verus multichain protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExactly! The bridge-converter plays a crucial role in the Verus multichain protocol as it enables the seamless conversion of currencies between different PBaaS-blockchains. This allows users to use any currency available in the bridge-converter to pay fees and perform transactions on any PBaaS-blockchain. It's the key to unlocking the full potential of the Verus ecosystem, enabling users to interact with different blockchains and currencies without any hassle.",

            "Last month a lot of quiet progress was made on the development of the Verus multichain protocol. A new public testnet is on the verge of release with additional core protocol features. All effort is put into making Verus a decentralized and robust protocol that just works.\nExporting Currencies\nCurrencies on one PBaaS-blockchain can be exported to any other PBaaS-blockchain. This means that a currency can easily be made available on multiple blockchains.\nAn example: we have CHICKEN-currency on a PBaaS-chain and want it to be available on the Verus-blockchain as well. We export CHICKEN-currency to the Verus-blockchain for a fee and now CHICKEN-currency is available there too. It goes without saying that all fees go to the miners and stakers of the network.\nWe can pay this fee in whatever currency we want, as long as it is available in the bridge-converter.\nThis fee is defined by the PBaaS-chain where you want the currency to be exported to, and thus can differ within all the multiple blockchains in the network.\nFee Structures\nOn the previous public testnet you could only make transactions if you had the native currency of the blockchain. Now you can use any currency that is in the bridge-converter as a fee to do operations on any PBaaS-blockchain.\nAny currency on a blockchain can be used as fees to do transactions. Example: if you have USDC on the Verus-blockchain you don\u2019t need VRSC to send the USDC around. It automatically converts a small fee of USDC to VRSC through a bridge-converter and uses that as its transaction fee.\nThis is an incredibly hard problem to solve. Yet it is working now on internal Verus test builds.",
