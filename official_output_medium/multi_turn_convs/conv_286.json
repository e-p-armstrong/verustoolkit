    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi! I'm trying to prepare my Verus Mobile wallet to receive some ERC-20s on Verus. Do you know how I can do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo prepare your Verus Mobile wallet to receive USDC, EURC, or DAI (as ERC-20s), you need to add the currencies on the Verus blockchain to your wallet. This can be done by pressing the plus-button in the bottom-right corner, then pressing \"Add PBaaS currency\", filling in the currency name (e.g. eurc.veth, vusdc.veth or dai.veth), and pressing \"ADD\". Have you tried that already?\n\n**User:**\nThat was really helpful, thanks! Now I want to bridge some EURC from Ethereum to Verus using Verus Mobile. Can you walk me through that process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo bridge EURC (or other ERC-20s) from Ethereum to Verus using Verus Mobile, you need to select the ERC-20 you want to bridge, press \"Send\" and then \"Convert or cross-chain\", press \"Send off-chain\", fill in the recipient address (a Verus address you own), the amount you want to bridge, select \"Verus\" as the network to send to, and choose the currency to receive as (e.g. EURC.vETH). Do you have any questions about that process?\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand that, but I'd also like to know how to bridge EURC from Ethereum to Verus using MetaMask and the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo bridge EURC (or other ERC-20s) from Ethereum to Verus using MetaMask and the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website, you need to connect MetaMask with the website, fill in the address where you want the funds to end up on the Verus blockchain, select the token you want to bridge (e.g. EURC.vETH), select the destination (the same address on VRSC), choose the amount you want to bridge, and then wait for up to 90 minutes for the funds to arrive on Verus. Have you used MetaMask before?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that Switch is fully launched now. Can you tell me how I can convert between VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH, and EURC.vETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith Switch fully launched, you can convert between VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH, and EURC.vETH using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) on Verus DeFi. This can be done using Verus Desktop or Verus Mobile. It's a convenient way to switch between these currencies. Do you have any other questions about Switch or Verus DeFi?",
