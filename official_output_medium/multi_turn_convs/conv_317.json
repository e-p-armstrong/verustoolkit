    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a question about running the Verus daemon. How can I ensure that it continues running even after I close my SSH terminal window?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo ensure that your Verus daemon continues running even after you close your SSH terminal window, you can use the `screen` command. First, install `screen` and then launch it with the command `screen`. This will start a new terminal inside your SSH session that you can reattach to later. You can then launch the Verus daemon with the command `./verus-cli/verusd -mint` and safely close your SSH terminal window. When you return to check on it later, you can reattach to the screen with the command `screen -r`.\n\n**User:**\nAnother question, this time about scripting. How do I construct a \"From\" email address for scripts that involve emailing me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo construct a \"From\" email address for scripts",

The first thing I would do with this is create a text document where you can keep notes on different commands you\u2019ll need to issue down the road, commands you may not want to script.\nFor example, to unshield coins (send from your zsAddr, the new Sapling Z address, to your tAddr) you may want to issue the command each time so you can be custom with your amount as well as wallet addresses. Shielding, however, can be done with a single command for All coinbases that need shielding, so it\u2019s easy to script.\nYou can also store your t and zs addresses in that document, so you can easily copy and paste whenever necessary.
