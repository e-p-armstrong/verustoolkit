    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm excited to start exploring PBaaS, but I need some VRSCTEST coins to do so. How can I get some?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can obtain VRSCTEST coins by mining them yourself or by asking for some in the Verus Discord community. Friendly test-net whales in the community may be willing to give you some for free. Once you receive the coins, you can see them in your balance after the syncing progress bar in your wallet loads fully. Do you have any experience with mining or the Verus community?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I don't have much experience in those areas. But I'm eager to learn more about PBaaS. What is the purpose of the PBaaS create menu, and how do I access it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe PBaaS create menu allows you to create your own chain. To access it, navigate to the PBaaS tab in your Verus wallet, and then click on the \"Create\" option. This menu will guide you through the process of specifying the details of your new chain. Are you ready to create your own chain?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I think so! What kind of customization options do I have when creating a new chain in PBaaS?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen creating a new chain in PBaaS, you have a wide range of customization options. You can specify details such as the name of your chain, whether you want a premine and how large it should be, the reward schedule, and how much to reward notaries for securing your chain. These options allow you to tailor your chain to your specific needs and preferences. It's quite flexible!\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! I'm curious about the \"initial notarization offer\" in the create chain form. What is it, and why is it important?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"initial notarization offer\" is the amount of VRSCTEST you need to pay to start your chain. It's essential to ensure that your balance can cover this amount before creating your chain. This payment is necessary to initiate the chain creation process. Make sure you have enough VRSCTEST in your wallet before proceeding!",
