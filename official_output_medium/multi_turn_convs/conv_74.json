    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about VerusIDs being self-sovereign. What does that mean, exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen we say that a VerusID is self-sovereign, we mean that you have complete ownership and control over your VerusID through the use of private keys. No one besides you has control over your VerusID unless you choose to grant them permission. Additionally, VerusID is a permissionless system, which means that anyone in the world can create a VerusID without needing approval from a central authority.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also heard that VerusIDs are revocable and recoverable. What does that mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen creating a VerusID, you can specify a revoke ID and a recover ID. This allows you to recover your identity if your private keys are lost or stolen, as well as revoke access to your identity if needed. This functionality is critical for any system of self-sovereign identities, as it provides a path to recover your identity in case of private key loss or theft.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen that VerusIDs have friendly names, like \"Verus Coin Foundation@\". What's the significance of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID has a friendly, human-readable name, which makes it easier to receive, send, and secure all your cryptocurrencies. This also means that funds held in a VerusID address are recoverable in the event of private key loss.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that VerusID has a multisig feature. How does that benefit users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach VerusID can function as a multisig address, making it possible for multiple people to control the address. This enables new methods for organizations or groups of people to work together, providing a more collaborative and secure way to manage funds and identities.\n\n**User:**\nAre there any other features of VerusID that I should know about?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome additional features of VerusID include Z-addresses (Sapling) for private transactions and messages, unforgeable signatures for messages and file signing, and the ability to transfer a VerusID to another address, including all of its UTXOs.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question: is there a way to earn VRSC with VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, VerusID has a referral system in which anyone can earn VRSC. Referrals go back 3 levels as part of the blockchain rules. An unreferred VerusID costs 100 VRSC.",
