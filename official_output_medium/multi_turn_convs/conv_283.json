    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand how Verus enables interoperability between different blockchains. Can you explain how transactions are imported and exported between different chains or systems in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTransactions are imported and exported between different chains or systems in Verus using a process that involves bundling transactions and proving their validity using cryptographically sound methods. This process allows for the transfer of transactions between chains, including Ethereum, using a protocol that prevents MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) and ensures the integrity of the transactions. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. I've also heard about relayers playing a role in this process. What's their role in the transaction import and export process in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRelayers play a crucial role in the transaction import and export process in Verus by shuttling transaction bundles between chains and networks. They can add arbitrage transactions when the destination is a PBaaS chain, but they cannot affect the provable source contents of a relayed bundle. Relayers are incentivized to perform this role as they can earn a validation fee from the import transaction itself.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about witnesses or notaries? I've seen them mentioned in the context of Verus's interoperability features. What's their role in the transaction import and export process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWitnesses/notaries have a limited role in the transaction import and export process in Verus. They do not control what transactions are included or the order in which they arrive from one system to another. Their primary role is to agree or disagree with the network validators' earned notarizations, which are earned on one blockchain and accepted on another chain or system.\n\n**User:**\nSo, can witnesses/notaries create notarizations or censor transactions in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, witnesses/notaries cannot create notarizations or censor transactions in Verus. They can only witness the validity of notarizations already created and agreed to by both proof of work and proof of stake validators.",
