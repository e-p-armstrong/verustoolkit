    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in staking on the Verus blockchain. What are the requirements for staking on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo stake successfully on the Verus blockchain, your wallet must meet the following requirements: \n\n1. The wallet must hold funds in one or more transparent addresses or VerusIDs.\n2. The wallet must be running, online, and synced to the Verus blockchain on a system with an accurate system clock.\n3. Staking must be enabled in the wallet software.\n\nDo you have any other questions about staking on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nWhy is staking disabled by default in Verus wallets?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nStaking is disabled by default in Verus wallets to prevent unintentionally staking from multiple computers or creating problems with accounting for staked funds when they\u2019re not expected.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any other questions about staking on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. How do I enable staking in the Verus Desktop wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable staking in the Verus Desktop wallet, you need to open the wallet and go to the Mining tab. Then, you can enable staking by clicking the icon of the dollar sign with a slash through it on the mining dashboard.\n\nHave you tried that? Do you have any other questions about staking on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nCan I stake from multiple computers using the same wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you should only stake from a single computer using a wallet. This is to prevent unintentionally staking from multiple computers or creating problems with accounting for staked funds when they\u2019re not expected.\n\nIt's important to follow these guidelines to avoid any issues with staking on Verus. Do you have any other questions?",
