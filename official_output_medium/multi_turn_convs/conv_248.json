    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been experiencing some wallet balance issues after staking or other activities. Do you know how I can fix them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm here to help! To fix wallet balance issues that may arise from staking or other activities, you can perform a Rescan. To do this, add the parameter `-rescan` when starting the daemon in the CLI, or follow these steps in the GUI: click \"Activate Coin\", choose \"Verus\" from the modal and select \"Native mode\", select the \"daemon param: rescan\" option, and then click \"Activate Coin\". This should help resolve any balance issues you're experiencing.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks! I've also heard that Verus has made some additional developments to support its blockchain upgrade. Can you tell me more about those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn addition to the wallet update, Verus has made two important developments to support the improved blockchain upgrade: an Electrum server with Sapling support and Sapling-enabled pool software. These developments enable Lite Mode Sapling Z-Transactions and provide fully Sapling-compatible pool software for the community.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What exactly does the Verus Electrum server do, and how does it support Sapling transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Electrum server is an Electrum server that has been enhanced to support Sapling transactions. It allows for Lite Mode Sapling Z-Transactions, making it possible to handle Sapling transactions seamlessly. This support has been tested and deployed on Verus' Electrum Server for use with all lite mode transactions.",
