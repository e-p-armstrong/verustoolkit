    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about the current state of crypto protocols, and I was wondering, what's the main issue with most of them today?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Most crypto protocols are trying to service the world with a single, monolithic blockchain, which becomes a central hub where all smart contracts and applications revolve around. This approach leads to scalability issues, resulting in high transaction fees, and eventually, compromises on decentralization and security. It's a major limitation that many protocols are struggling with.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, how does Verus approach scalability differently from other crypto protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus acknowledges the need for a multi-server, multi-chain world to scale for billions of people globally. Instead of trying to increase the performance of a single monolithic blockchain, Verus offers a new approach with Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service), where each organization or business can launch its own highly capable, rent-free, no-coding-required blockchain. This allows for a more decentralized and scalable approach to blockchain technology.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service), and how it enables scalability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) is a technology that allows each organization or business to launch its own highly capable, rent-free, no-coding-required blockchain. These PBaaS-chains are fully independent and can be customized to the organization's needs, enabling unlimited scalability without compromising on decentralization and security. It's a game-changer for scalability in the blockchain space.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, how does Verus's approach to scalability differ from the traditional approach of increasing transactions per second?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus's approach to scalability differs from the traditional approach of increasing transactions per second in that it doesn't try to scale up a single monolithic blockchain. Instead, it enables multiple independent blockchains to be launched, each with its own capabilities, allowing for unlimited scalability without compromising on decentralization and security. It's a more distributed and flexible approach to scalability, rather than trying to force a single blockchain to handle everything.",
