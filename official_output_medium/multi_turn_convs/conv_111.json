    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been digging into Verus and I'm curious about the person behind it. Who is the lead developer of Verus, and what is his background in the tech industry?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe lead developer of Verus is Mike Toutonghi, a seasoned web veteran with a rich history in the tech industry. He has led Kernel development on Microsoft 95, co-founded Microsoft's Java efforts and .Net, and has experience in architecting data systems for Internet-scale advertising.\n\n**User:**\nThat's impressive. What led Mike Toutonghi to start working on Verus, and what are some of the key innovations he has brought to the project?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMike Toutonghi recognized the need for blockchain interoperability and more resilient consensus algorithms. He started by adding Custom Consensus (smart contracts) to Bitcoin script and later modified the core consensus rules. Alongside his son and dozens of leading developers, he is pushing the limits of blockchain technology, mitigating vulnerabilities, and innovating solutions.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about how Verus fits into the broader blockchain ecosystem. What is the relationship between Verus and other blockchain projects, such as Komodo, Zcash, BTCD, and Bitcoin?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus is an evolution of Komodo, Zcash, BTCD, and Bitcoin, building upon their foundations and incorporating new innovations to create a more advanced blockchain framework.",
