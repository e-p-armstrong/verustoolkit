    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been thinking about creating a project on Verus, but I'm not sure how to get miners to pick it up. What motivates miners to pick up my project on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMiners within the Verus ecosystem are motivated to pick up your project because they can mine up to 22 chains simultaneously, maximizing their profits. Additionally, you can offer an extra motivation by adding some $VRSC to sweeten the deal. This way, miners have a financial incentive to support your project.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But I'm still curious about the bigger picture. What is the goal of the Verus ecosystem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe goal of the Verus ecosystem is to bring unique ideas, inspiring people, and new markets together, creating comfort, safety, and ease of use for entrepreneurs and investors alike. Verus aims to create a comprehensive platform that fosters innovation, collaboration, and growth, making it an attractive environment for projects like yours to thrive.",
