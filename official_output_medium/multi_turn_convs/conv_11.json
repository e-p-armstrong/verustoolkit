    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the new Sapling z-address format, and I was wondering, what's the main benefit of using addresses that start with \"zs\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Sapling z-address format starting with \"zs\" offers several advantages. One of the main benefits is that it allows for shorter shielded addresses and enables generating addresses at scale within a wallet without computational cost. This makes it more flexible and efficient for enterprises and exchanges to create trillions of z-addresses in advance or on the fly. Do you have any further questions about the Sapling z-address format?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard that shielded transactions with the new \"zs\" addresses have improved in terms of performance. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, indeed! Shielded transactions with the new \"zs\" addresses utilize Sapling's performance upgrades, which enable payments to be constructed in a few seconds or even less than 1 second, while using as little as 40 MB of memory. This makes shielded transactions possible on mobile or IoT devices. It's a significant improvement in terms of performance.\n\n**User:**\nAnother thing I've come across is the concept of decoupling spend authority in Sapling. What's the benefit of doing that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSapling introduces split spending and proving keys, allowing the spending key to be stored independently of the proving key. This enables the proving key, which handles complex tasks, to be stored on a separate or untrusted device without posing any risk. It's a big step forward in terms of security and flexibility.\n\n**User:**\nLastly, I've heard that there's an improvement coming soon to viewing keys in Sapling. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, that's correct! Viewing keys will soon support incoming and outgoing transaction detail viewing for owners, allowing them to view or share the new full viewing key with a trusted party without exposing their spending key, and providing visibility to outbound transactions. It's going to make it easier for users to manage their transactions and maintain their privacy.",
