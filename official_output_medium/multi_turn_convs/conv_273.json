    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about DeFi on Verus. What's the advantage of using fractional currencies in Verus DeFi protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe advantage of using fractional currencies in Verus DeFi protocols is that they do not need to be 100% backed by their underlying reserve basket. This allows for seamless liquidity to and from the basket currencies, earning fees between them, and providing investment value that may far exceed the value of the currencies held in reserve. Would you like to know more about how DeFi transactions work on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that would be great. How do I conduct DeFi transactions on Verus, and what are the benefits of doing so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi transactions are conducted through normal \"send transactions\" using the `sendcurrency` API or the GUI in the wallet. To convert from one currency to another, a user simply sends to themselves, electing to convert from a particular token to another token via a multi-reserve currency that contains both tokens as reserves. The benefits of doing so include ease of use, low transaction costs, and scalability. It's really easy to use and provides a lot of flexibility.\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how Verus DeFi handles liquidity and scalability. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi handles liquidity and scalability through its multi-reserve currency system, which allows for seamless liquidity to and from the basket currencies. Additionally, Verus is implementing multi-chain capabilities with independent blockchains that are interoperable, allowing a particular token to exist on more than one chain. This leads to practically unlimited scalability, as multi-reserves and popular tokens do not lead to chain congestion or transaction fee competition, keeping transaction fees at a minimal level.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really powerful. What makes pool creation easy to use in Verus DeFi?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPool creation is made easy to use in Verus DeFi because no programming is required to define a pool. This allows users of all types to create liquidity pools without needing to have technical expertise. Anyone can create a pool and start providing liquidity, which makes the whole system more accessible and user-friendly.",
