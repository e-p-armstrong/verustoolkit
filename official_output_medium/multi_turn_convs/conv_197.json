    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm running an older version of my Verus wallet and I want to make sure I'm up to date. How can I update my Verus wallet to the latest version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUpdating your Verus wallet is a relatively straightforward process. To update your Verus wallet, you'll need to follow a series of steps. First, back up your wallet.dat file. Then, download the latest Verus bootstrap file (VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz) and extract its contents into your .komodo/VRSC folder (on Linux) or %appdata%\\Komodo\\VRSC folder (on Windows). That should do the trick! Do you have any other questions about updating your wallet?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, I do. I'm also using Komodo's Agama wallet and I want to make sure I can still support KMD native within the Verus wallet. What do I need to do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you're installing Verus alongside Komodo's Agama wallet or want to support KMD native within the Verus wallet, you'll need to sync the entire Komodo blockchain again due to the new Zcash Params. To save time syncing, you can download a recent KMD bootstrap file (KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz) and extract its contents into your .komodo folder (on Linux) or %appdata%\\Komodo folder (on Windows). That should allow you to use both wallets seamlessly.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I've updated my wallet and set everything up. How do I launch the updated Verus wallet for the first time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen launching the updated Verus wallet for the first time, select VRSC under the \"Native Mode\" dropdown. You'll be prompted to download the latest Zcash Params; follow the steps to do so. That's it! Your Verus wallet should now be up and running with the latest updates. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
