    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in trying out Verus for myself. Where can I download the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can download the Verus software from the official Verus website: https://veruscoin.io/#download. Make sure to only download from the official website to ensure you're getting the genuine software.\n\n**User:**\nI've downloaded the software. What should I do with it now?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOnce you've downloaded the Verus software, you should unzip the compressed folder to a location on your computer where you can easily launch it from, such as your Desktop. It's a good idea to rename the folder to \"Verus v<x>\" where \"<x>\" is the current version, so you can keep track of which version you're running. This will help you stay organized and ensure you're always using the latest version.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I've unzipped the folder. How do I launch the Verus wallet software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch the Verus wallet software, locate the Agama app within the unzipped folder and launch it. On the first screen, select VRSC from the drop-down menu under \"Lite (SPV) Mode\" and then choose \"Create new wallet\". This will get you started with creating your own Verus wallet. Do you have any more questions about getting started with Verus?",
