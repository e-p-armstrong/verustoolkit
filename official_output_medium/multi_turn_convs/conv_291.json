    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about Switch on the Verus blockchain, but I'm not really sure what it is. Can you explain what Switch is and how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSwitch is a decentralized currency on the Verus blockchain, fully backed by its reserves. Its initial supply is 20,000 Switch, and its reserves are weighted as follows: VRSC (16%), DAI (21%), USDC (21%), and EURC (42%). This means that the value of Switch is tied to the value of its reserves. Switch can be used to convert between any of the reserves for a maximum fee of 0.05%. It is a MEV-resistant AMM, and 50% of the conversion fees are distributed to the miners and stakers of Verus, while the other 50% stay in the reserves, increasing the value of Switch.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. How can I use Switch to convert between different currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use Switch to convert between VRSC, DAI, USDC, or EURC, or vice versa. Switch acts as an Automated Market Maker (AMM), allowing you to convert between the reserves with each other. You can also use Switch to bridge EURC or USDC to the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the risks and benefits of holding Switch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne of the benefits of holding Switch is that it accrues 50% of the conversion fees, which stay in the reserves, increasing the value of Switch. However, there is also a risk to holding Switch, as USDC and EURC are distributed by the centralized company Circle. Additionally, the supply of Switch is dynamic, and it can be minted or burned when people convert to or from it.\n\n**User:**\nWhere can I find more information about Switch and its statistics?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about Switch and its statistics at Cryptodashboard or verus.trading. Additionally, you can type `/switch` in the `#trading` channel in the Verus community Discord to learn more.",
