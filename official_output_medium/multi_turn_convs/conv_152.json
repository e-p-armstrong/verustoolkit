    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how Verus DeFi currencies work. Can you explain how the value of a Verus DeFi currency like NewCurrency fluctuates?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe value of a Verus DeFi currency like NewCurrency fluctuates depending on what is in its liquidity pool. The liquidity pool is made up of reserve currencies, and the balance of these currencies in the pool affects the price of the DeFi currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've heard the term \"automated market maker\" thrown around in relation to Verus DeFi currencies. Can you explain what that is and how it relates to Verus DeFi currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAn automated market maker is a system that provides liquidity to a market without the need for a person to set the price. In the context of Verus DeFi currencies, the automated market maker ensures that there is always liquidity available, and the price of the currency is determined by the balance of the reserve currencies in the liquidity pool.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, how does the liquidity pool always have liquidity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is always liquidity in a Verus DeFi currency's liquidity pool because a liquidity pool can never be completely empty. One can always add or remove reserve currencies, such as VRSC or ETH, to maintain a balance. When the balance tips too much to one side, there is an opportunity to arbitrage and make money, ensuring that there is always something to trade against.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the benefit of holding a Verus DeFi currency like NewCurrency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nHolding a Verus DeFi currency like NewCurrency provides a portfolio management benefit. It acts as a constant-mix strategy, exposing the holder to two different currencies while only holding one. Additionally, holders of NewCurrency earn fees from people converting their currencies.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen the term \"fractional currency\" used in the Verus ecosystem. What does that mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus ecosystem, a fractional currency is a currency that has a pool of liquidity attached to it. The currencies that make up this pool of liquidity are called reserve currencies.\n\n**User:**\nWhy are Verus DeFi currencies like NewCurrency called \"fractional currencies\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi currencies like NewCurrency are called \"fractional currencies\" because they derive their value from the reserve currencies in their liquidity pool. The value of the fractional currency is a fraction of the value of the reserve currencies.",
