    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in the potential applications of Verus technology. What are some examples of digital goods that could be created around successful influencers, using Verus technology?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome examples of digital goods that could be created around successful influencers using Verus technology include fan IDs, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), fan profiles, tickets, coupons or gift cards, discount codes, memberships, log-in/access, and voting. These digital goods can be created to represent a fan's support or status within an influencer community, and can be traded, sold, or given away to fans.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a lot of possibilities! How can influencers benefit from creating digital goods using Verus technology, without having to continuously issue new tokens?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nInfluencers can benefit from creating digital goods using Verus technology by creating a self-sustaining economy around their brand. By creating digital goods that can be acquired, traded, and used by fans, influencers can capture value without having to continuously issue new tokens. This can be done by allowing fans to acquire these digital goods using social tokens, which can be earned or purchased, and then used to access exclusive content, merchandise, or experiences. This model allows influencers to benefit from their brand's popularity without having to constantly issue new tokens, and it also enables fans to show their support and engage with the influencer's brand in a more meaningful way.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What is the significance of community-created activity in the context of digital goods and social tokens on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCommunity-created activity is important because it can thrive and persist even without continuous activity from the influencer. This means that fans can continue to create and trade digital goods, participate in voting, and engage with the influencer's brand, even if the influencer is not actively issuing new tokens or creating new content. This self-sustaining economy can lead to a longer lifespan for the social token economy and provide more value to both influencers and fans.",
