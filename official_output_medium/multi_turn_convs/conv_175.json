It's an important step forward for Verus, and I'm happy to help clarify any other questions you might have!\n\n**User:**\nSpeaking of updates, I heard there were some new ones available for Verus Desktop and CLI wallets. What kind of updates were made available, and who are they critical for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nHighly recommended non-mandatory updates were made available for Verus Desktop and CLI wallets.

It's an exciting development, and we're looking forward to seeing how it unfolds!\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I heard that the Verus website is getting an overhaul. What changes can we expect from the new site?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe upcoming Verus website overhaul is expected to bring better, more concise messaging, easier-to-understand copywriting, more illustrations, and a clearer design, making it easier for people to digest and understand Verus. It's all part of our effort to make Verus more accessible and user-friendly, so stay tuned for the new site's launch!",
