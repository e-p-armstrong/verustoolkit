    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about a Discord session hijack vulnerability and its impact on the Verus network and wallets. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Discord session hijack vulnerability did not compromise any funds on the Verus network or in Verus wallets. The Verus network and wallets were not subject to the vulnerabilities exploited by the hackers. The Verus team takes security very seriously, and the network and wallets were designed with robust security measures to prevent such attacks.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. But I'm curious, how did the hackers manage to inflict damage on the Discord server used by the Verus community?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe hackers used a combination of a Discord session hijack vulnerability and social engineering to gain control of the Discord server. They did not need to gain full control or credentials for any account to inflict damage on the server. It's a reminder for all of us to be vigilant and cautious when interacting with unknown individuals or entities online.\n\n**User:**\nWhat measures could have been taken to prevent or minimize the damage caused by a Discord server attack?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nImproving false positive account disablement and response time to critical support requests could have cut short the attack immediately. It's an important lesson learned for the Verus community and other online communities to prioritize security and response times to potential threats.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that the hackers used a certain approach to gain trust with the Verus community. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, unfortunately, the hackers approached the Verus community by posing as journalists and worked to establish trust over a period of weeks. They were persistent but not pushy, and even collaborated on an article with the community. It's a reminder to be cautious when interacting with unknown individuals or entities online, even if they seem legitimate or friendly.",
