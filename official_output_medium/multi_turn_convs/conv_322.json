    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been hearing about Consensus 2022 and Verus's attendance. What's the significance of Verus attending Consensus 2022?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus attending Consensus 2022 was a significant event for the community, as it provided an opportunity for community members to meet in person, generate interest, and have fun. The conference also reignited the community's passion for the Verus mission, which aims to create a public good for all of humanity by enabling novel ways for people to work together and create value. It was a great chance for people to come together and share their enthusiasm for the project.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a great event! I've been wondering about community currencies and social tokens on the Verus protocol. What are they, and how can they be used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCommunity currencies and social tokens are types of digital currencies that can be used on the Verus protocol. Community currencies are designed to be used within specific communities or localities, while social tokens are used to represent value within social networks or online communities. These currencies and tokens can be created and used on the Verus protocol without requiring programming knowledge, making it easy for communities to design and implement their own customized currencies. This opens up new possibilities for communities to create their own economic systems and reward structures, which can be really powerful for building engagement and fostering cooperation.",
