    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nOkay, I've finished downloading Verus. What's the next step? How do I launch Verus and what do I need to do before proceeding?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNow that you've completed the download, close the modal and select VRSC from \"Native Mode\". Verus will launch and begin to sync. Make sure to allow the sync to reach 100% before proceeding. This is an important step, so don't rush it!\n\n**User:**\nWhat about Step 6 in the Verus installation process? What's the purpose of that step, and what do I need to do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nStep 6 is an optional step for enabling KMD support in your Verus wallet or installing Verus alongside Agama. If you want to complete this step, you'll need to close the Verus wallet, wait for it to shut down completely, and then launch Verus wallet again, choosing KMD from the \"Native Mode\" dropdown list. Komodo will launch and begin to sync, which may take a few minutes. Just like before, allow the sync to reach 100% before clicking \"Activate Coin\" and adding VRSC in Native mode.\n\n**User:**\nI followed Steps 3 and 4 during the update process, and I cleared out the contents of my hidden VRSC and Komodo folders. What do I need to do now?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you followed Steps 3 and 4, you'll need to restore your original wallet.dat files. To do this, close Verus wallet and wait for it to shut down completely. Then, copy your backed up wallet.dat files back into their appropriate folders. For Linux, the KMD wallet.dat file goes into /home/yourusername/.komodo, and the Verus wallet.dat file goes into /home/yourusername/.komodo/VRSC. For Windows, the KMD wallet.dat file goes into %appdata%/Komodo, and the Verus wallet.dat file goes into %appdata%/Komodo/VRSC.",
