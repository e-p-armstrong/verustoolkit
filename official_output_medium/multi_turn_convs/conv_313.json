    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and I'm curious about Cross-Chain Exports. Can you tell me what a Cross-Chain Export (CCE) is in the context of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA Cross-Chain Export (CCE) is a rolled-up collection of cross-chain transactions. Once created, a CCE is added to a block by a miner or staker, who is rewarded a fee for doing so. The CCE is then officially part of the blockchain and linked to the \"stateroot\" (Merkle Mountain Range). Do you have any other questions about CCEs or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. Another thing I'm not entirely clear on is notarizations. How are notarizations confirmed and used as proof in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotarizations are confirmed by miners and stakers, and then signed by notary witnesses. To be used as proof, a notarization must be on the blockchain for at least 10 blocks, confirmed by another notarization, and signed by at least 8 of 15 notary witnesses worldwide. That's a pretty high level of confirmation, ensuring the security and integrity of the process. Do you have any other questions about notarizations?\n\n**User:**\nSo, what happens to a confirmed notarization on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOnce a notarization is confirmed on Verus, it is sent to Ethereum, where it becomes pending. After receiving another notarization on Ethereum, the transactions (CCE) in that block are sent to the Ethereum smart contract, along with the Merkle Mountain Range proof. If valid, the assets are sent to the user's Ethereum wallet. It's a pretty seamless process, once everything is confirmed.\n\n**User:**\nWho can roll up transactions into a CCE and mine it, and what do they get in return?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAnyone can roll up transactions into a CCE and mine it, and in return, they get a reward. Additionally, the notary witnesses who pay the ETH fees to send the CCE to Ethereum also get a share of the fees to subsidize their transaction costs. It's a win-win for everyone involved.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens when there is no traffic from Verus to Ethereum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen there is no traffic from Verus to Ethereum, the notarizations are continued to be mined in on Verus, but they do not need to be sent to Ethereum. This minimizes costs when traffic is light, making the process more efficient and cost-effective.",
