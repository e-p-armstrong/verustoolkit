    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to set up a new droplet for use as a Verus staking server. What's the first step I should take?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe first step is to set a new root password. This should be a highly secure and complex password that is not used elsewhere. It's essential to make it strong to prevent unauthorized access to your system. Have you set up a droplet before, or do you need further guidance?\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks! What's the next step? I think I need to create a new user account or something?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's correct! The next step is to create a new user account in the Droplet. The purpose of creating a new user account is to have a secure way to access the system, without using the root account. This new user account should have \"sudo\" privileges, which allows it to run commands with superuser privileges. This way, you can access the system securely without having to use the root account for everything.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I've created the new user account. What's the next step?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNow it's essential to test the new user account to ensure that it is working correctly and that you can SSH into the Droplet using the new account. This is crucial before removing root SSH privilege. If you don't test it and remove root SSH privilege, you might lock yourself out of the system. So, try logging in with the new user account and verify that everything is working as expected.",

            " right. This opens a new console window, which looks just like a terminal window.\nPart Three \u2014 Configure The Droplet\nNow that the droplet is setup and online, you\u2019ll want to configure it for use as your Verus staking server. Following are my recommendations and in my opinion, the best practices.\nStep 1 \u2014 New Root Password\nSet a new root password straight away! To do this, login to your new droplet using the Console from the Management within your Digital Ocean account using the root password emailed to you. Your droplet will prompt you to reset your password (create a new one). Use a highly secure and complex password that you do not use elsewhere.\nStep 2 \u2014 Setup SSH\nNext, setup SSH to use your SSH Key for logging into your Droplet (instead of password authentication). If you don\u2019t know how, follow this guide: How to Add SSH Keys to Your Droplet.\nBefore removing root SSH privilege, follow the next step to create a new account in your Droplet.\nStep 3 \u2014 Setup New Secure User Account\nNext, you need to setup a new user account in the Droplet which will run Verus and be your access to the system, so root is not used for access.\nHere are the steps to create a new user account, give it \u201csudo\u201d privileges, test it and disable root SSH:\nYou\u2019ll create the new user account with: adduser username make sure to change username to the username you want to use for this account. You\u2019ll have prompts for Full Name, etc\u2026but the only important thing is setting the secure password for this account. Make it as secure as your root password!\nAfter the user account is created, give it sudo privileges with: \nusermod -aG sudo username again, replace username with the username you created.\nNext, log off the server and test that you can SSH using the new user account.\nIf it went well, it will login fine and you can now remove root SSH privilege:\n- Open the sshd_config file as sudo to edit:\nsudo nan",
