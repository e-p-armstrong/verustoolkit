    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and I came across something called \"mapped currency\" in the context of Verus and vETH IDs. Can you explain what that is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA \"mapped currency\" is a type of currency that can be created using a *.vETH ID, which can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network by exporting it to the vETH bridge. This allows for seamless interaction between the Verus network and the Ethereum network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I was wondering, who can create these mapped currencies to a gateway in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOnly Verus root IDs and IDs of a gateway can create mapped currencies to a gateway. This ensures that only trusted and authorized entities can create these mapped currencies.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been reading about the Verus Fee Pool technology. Can you explain what that is and how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Fee Pool technology is a unique solution in Verus that goes live with PBaaS. As people use the cross-chain, DeFi, or purchase/register IDs on the network, the miner or staker will put all fees into the on-chain \"fee pool\", and then take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward. This technology aligns all validator incentives and prevents validators from gaming the fee system. It's an innovative approach to fee management that ensures the integrity and security of the network.",
