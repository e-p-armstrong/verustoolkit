    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to set up my server for Verus. After rebooting, how can I verify that my swap space is enabled and set to 4GB?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify that your swap space is enabled and set to 4GB, you can simply run the command `free -m` in the terminal. This command will display information about your system's memory and swap space, including the amount of swap space available. Give it a try and see if everything looks good!\n\n**User:**\nThanks for that. I'm also wondering, what dependencies and tools are required to install Verus and begin staking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo install Verus and begin staking, you'll need to have the following dependencies and tools installed on your system: `build-essential`, `pkg-config`, `libc6-dev`, `m4`, `g++-multilib`, `autoconf`, `libtool`, `ncurses-dev`, `unzip`, `git`, `python`, `python-zmq`, `zlib1g-dev`, `wget`, `libcurl4-openssl-dev`, and `bsdmainutils`. These dependencies and tools are necessary to build and run Verus on your system. Make sure you have them all installed before proceeding!",
