    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've heard about Verus showcasing something at Consensus 2024. What's that about?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus is showcasing its fully completed PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) blockchain technology at Consensus 2024. This technology allows for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) with more capabilities, security, and scalability compared to traditional VM-centric networks like Ethereum.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What are some of the major issues with Ethereum and other VM-centric networks that the Verus Protocol solves?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Protocol solves several issues with Ethereum and other VM-centric networks, including high gas fees, limited scalability, vulnerability to smart contract hacks and bugs, MEV (miner extractable value) at the protocol level, lack of a built-in identity model, insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms, and the need for expensive Solidity developers.\n\n**User:**\nWow, that's quite a list. How does the Verus Protocol differ from traditional VM-centric networks like Ethereum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Protocol differs from traditional VM-centric networks like Ethereum in that it does not use smart contracts, but instead uses smart transactions. This makes it easier to use and more practical for achieving most capabilities, without the need for programming knowledge. Additionally, Verus is fully interoperable with Ethereum through the non-custodial, trustless, and decentralized Verus-Ethereum Bridge.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's this Verus-Ethereum Bridge I keep hearing about? What does it enable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus-Ethereum Bridge is a non-custodial, trustless, and decentralized bridge that enables interoperability between Verus and Ethereum. It allows for the seamless transfer of assets and data between the two networks, making it possible for applications to leverage the strengths of both platforms.",
