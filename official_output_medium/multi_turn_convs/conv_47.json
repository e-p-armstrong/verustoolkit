    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been interested in the Verus network and its mining process. Can you tell me, why was VerusHash 2.0 designed, and what is its main goal?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.0 was designed to address the gap in hash power between FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and CPUs on the Verus network. Its main goal is to equalize mining across all hardware platforms, favoring the latest CPUs over older types, and enabling people with just a CPU to easily contribute to and join the Verus Community through mining.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How does VerusHash 2.0 differ from VerusHash 1.0, and what was the strategy behind its design?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.0 differs from VerusHash 1.0 in that it was designed to better equalize mining across all hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. The strategy behind its design was to leverage a number of additional strengths of CPUs, while placing more of a burden on some weaknesses of FPGAs, with the goal of promoting decentralization and allowing more people to participate in mining Verus Coin.\n\n**User:**\nGoing back a bit, what was the original goal of VerusHash 1.0, and how did it achieve it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe original goal of VerusHash 1.0 was to promote decentralization by allowing more people to participate in mining Verus Coin. It achieved this by leveraging the highly integrated instruction sets of modern CPUs, which gave CPUs an advantage over GPUs. This design choice was made to allow more people to participate in mining, creating a stronger network.",
