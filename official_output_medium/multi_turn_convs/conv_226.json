    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm planning to launch a new currency on Verus, and I want to make sure I do it correctly. What's the importance of testing a currency on the Verus testnet before launching it on the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! It is highly recommended to test a currency on the Verus testnet before launching it on the mainnet to ensure that everything works as expected and to identify any potential issues before they affect real users on the mainnet. You don't want to risk any problems or errors affecting your users, so testing on the testnet is a crucial step.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the advice! Now, I'd like to know how to launch a currency on Verus using Verus Desktop. Can you walk me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a currency on Verus using Verus Desktop, go to \"Settings\" (cogwheel top-right) -> \"Coin Settings\". There, you can run commands in Verus Desktop. Specifically, you can use the `definecurrency` command to define the currency and then use the `sendrawtransaction` command with the returned HEX to broadcast the currency to the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I want to use the command-line interface instead? How do I launch a currency on Verus using the CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a currency on Verus using the command-line interface, you can use the `definecurrency` command followed by the currency definition, and then use the `sendrawtransaction` command with the returned HEX to broadcast the currency to the blockchain. It's a similar process to using Verus Desktop, but you'll be using the command-line interface instead.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the HEX returned after defining a currency on Verus? I'm not sure what to do with it.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe HEX returned after defining a currency on Verus is used to broadcast the currency to the blockchain. You need to use this HEX with the `sendrawtransaction` command to start the currency. It's an important step in the process, so make sure you don't skip it!\n\n**User:**\nOne last question: how can I get information about a currency on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrency` command in Verus Desktop or the command-line interface to lookup information about a currency on Verus. This can be done during the preconversion time frame and after the launch of the currency. It's a useful command to have in your toolkit!",
