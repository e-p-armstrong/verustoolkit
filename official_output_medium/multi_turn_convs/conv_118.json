    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been learning about Verus and I have some more questions. Can you explain the different states of a Vault in Verus, and what do they mean for fund spending?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, a Vault can be in one of three states: LOCKED, UNLOCK SOON, or NO LOCK. LOCKED means the Vault is locked and funds cannot be spent. UNLOCK SOON means the Vault is locked but will be unlocked within 30 days. NO LOCK means the Vault is not active, and funds can be spent. Does that help clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for that! I also have a question about VerusIDs. What is the primary address of a VerusID, and what is its significance?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe primary address of a VerusID is the owner of the VerusID, which contains the private key. It can contain more than one VerusID. This address has control over the VerusID and its associated funds. Think of it as the \"master key\" to your VerusID.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard of something called an \"identity address\" or \"i-address\" in Verus. Can you explain what that is, and how it relates to a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAn identity address (i-address) is an identifier of a VerusID, along with the name. It is a unique address associated with a VerusID. You can think of it as a unique label that identifies your VerusID.\n\n**User:**\nSo, why should I get a VerusID, and how can I get one?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGetting a VerusID allows you to be at the forefront of Verus' cutting-edge technology and have control over your digital identity and funds. You can get a VerusID for a small fee, which goes to the miners and stakers of the network, by downloading Verus Desktop or joining the Verus community on Discord. It's a great way to take control of your digital identity and be part of the Verus ecosystem!",
