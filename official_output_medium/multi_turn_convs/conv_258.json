    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in setting up a community currency on the Verus network. Can you tell me about the costs associated with doing so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe costs associated with setting up a community currency, like CommCurr, on the Verus network are minimal network costs. These costs are paid to the miners and stakers as block rewards for mining the Verus blockchain and powering all the community's transactions. The good news is that these costs are relatively low, less than $200 at current rates. Do you have any further questions about setting up a community currency on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! One thing I'm concerned about is maintaining privacy for community members' spending on the Verus network. How can we ensure that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAlthough community members' spending is transparent on the public blockchain, Verus, as a fork of zcash, offers private transactions on its native currency, Verus. This allows for methods to be developed to help protect the spending privacy of community members, preferably through their apps. Would you like more information on how to implement private transactions on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nAnother important aspect is governance and control. How can we manage these for CommCurr on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus protocols enable virtually unlimited flexibility with respect to the governance of who is in control of the initial holdings of CommCurr. This can be achieved through the use of multiple signatures, for example, 13 of 25, to authorize any spending or conversion activity, allowing for sophisticated approval mechanisms and safeguards for communities implementing this type of experiment. Would you like more information on how to set up governance structures on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nOne risk I've heard about is the moral hazard of dumping holdings and crushing the value of a growing community. How can we mitigate this risk on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network enables the ability to provably and irrevocably lock digital wallets for an arbitrary period of time (up to 21 years). This allows a community issuer to reduce concerns about the moral hazard of dumping their holdings and crushing the value of a growing community by using escrow mechanisms. This provides an added layer of security and trust in the community currency. Do you have any other questions about mitigating risks on Verus?",
