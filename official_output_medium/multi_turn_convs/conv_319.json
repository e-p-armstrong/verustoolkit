    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in registering a VerusID, but I want to know more about the costs involved. How much does it cost to register a VerusID, and who receives the payment?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe cost to register a VerusID is 100 VRSC. The payment goes to the miner or staker of the block that contains the VerusID registration. So, the community members who help maintain the Verus network are rewarded for their efforts.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But what if I have a referral when registering a VerusID? How does the payment get distributed in that case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have a referral when registering a VerusID, the cost of registration is actually lower, at 80 VRSC. The remaining 20 VRSC goes to the referrer as a reward for referring you. If the referrer also has a referrer, they also receive 20 VRSC. Up to 3 referrers can receive 20 VRSC each, and the remaining 20-60 VRSC goes to the miner or staker of the block. This incentivizes referrals and helps grow the Verus community.",
