    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been learning about the security features of Verus, and I had a question. What happens when a cheating transaction is detected in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a cheating transaction is detected, the Stake Guard CC signs the spend of the cheater's stake reward at the time of the cheat, using the Stake Guard's key, and spends it to the shielded address provided by the person who claimed the cheater's reward. The wallet of the person who found the cheat reward is paid the block reward, and it disappears from the cheater's wallet.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. Can you explain more about how the Decentralized Anti-Cheat Staking system works in Verus? I'm curious about the details.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Decentralized Anti-Cheat Staking system in Verus works by having the Stake Guard CC function normally for legitimate stakers, signing the coinbase reward transaction when they spend it with their own Public Key. However, if the 1 of 2 evaluation sees that the public key of the person trying to spend it doesn't match that of the original staker, it verifies that the person trying to take the free money from the cheater has proven that this is indeed a cheated transaction which they discovered, and if so, will let them take it.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So what's the incentive for people to detect and report cheating transactions in Verus? Why would someone go out of their way to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe incentive for people to detect and report cheating transactions in Verus is that they can claim the cheater's reward block by simply proving to the Stake Guard CC the verified cheat transaction hash in an OP_RETURN. This means that anyone can spend the cheater's reward block, making it pointless for the cheater to try to cheat in the first place. It's a way to encourage honesty and fairness in the network, while also providing a reward for those who help maintain its integrity.",
