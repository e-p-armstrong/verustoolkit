    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about Verus and its DeFi capabilities. I'm curious, what is the main advantage of Verus's parallel processing of DeFi transactions compared to the serial processing used in VM models like Ethereum/EOS/Tron?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main advantage of Verus's parallel processing of DeFi transactions is that it allows for lower costs, optimization of liquidity, and new benefits to users. This is achieved by reducing slippage, eliminating front-running, eliminating risks from faulty smart contracts and unintended consequences, and providing the fairest prices without regard to latency or gas price rigging. This approach makes DeFi transactions on Verus more efficient and user-friendly.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard that Verus DeFi is conducted by smart \"send transactions\" on Verus blockchains with multi-chain capabilities. What's the significance of this approach?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe significance of Verus DeFi being conducted by smart \"send transactions\" on Verus blockchains with multi-chain capabilities is that it keeps chain transaction costs as low as possible, allows for the use of new, less expensive chains to take traffic, and enables practically unlimited scalability. This allows Verus to handle a high volume of DeFi transactions without compromising on performance.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen some discussions about community-driven liquidity on Verus. What's the Verus community's view on this, and how does it differ from traditional yield farming approaches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus community believes that community-driven liquidity does not need to be driven entirely by yield farming, and that ample liquidity can be achieved through other means. This approach focuses on providing benefits to users and creating a more sustainable and equitable liquidity ecosystem. The Verus community is committed to building a more inclusive and community-driven DeFi system, and community-driven liquidity is a key part of that vision.",
