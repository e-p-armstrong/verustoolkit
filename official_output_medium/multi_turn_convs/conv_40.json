    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been doing some research on Verus and I'm really interested in learning more about its consensus mechanism. Can you tell me about Verus Proof of Power (VerusPoP) and how it protects the VerusCoin blockchain from 51% hash attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Proof of Power (VerusPoP) is a unique consensus mechanism that combines 50% Proof of Work (PoW) and 50% Proof of Stake (PoS) to generate new blocks. This hybrid approach helps prevent 51% hash attacks by requiring an attacker to control more than 50% of the validation power, also known as Chain Power. Additionally, VerusCoin utilizes Komodo's delayed Proof of Work, which notarizes the Verus blockchain into the Bitcoin blockchain, leveraging Bitcoin's hashrate to defend the Verus network. This added layer of security makes it much more difficult for an attacker to launch a successful 51% hash attack.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been wondering about the benefits of VerusCoin's 50/50 PoW/PoS ratio. How does it affect the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe 50/50 PoW/PoS ratio provides a further decentralizing effect on the network, incentivizing holders to keep nodes online to support the network. This ratio also ensures that even if there is a change in network hashrate, the PoW/PoS ratio remains the same, maintaining the security and decentralization of the network. It's a clever design that helps to keep the network secure and decentralized.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about VerusIDs. Can you tell me more about them? What features do they offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is a decentralized identity on the blockchain that offers revocation and recovery capabilities. It is self-sovereign, meaning that users have full control over their identity. VerusIDs can be created using the Verus Desktop wallet or the Command Line Interface (CLI). The creator of a VerusID pays a fee, which goes 100% to miners and stakers.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. How can I create a VerusID, and what are the fees associated with it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a VerusID using the Verus Desktop wallet or the Command Line Interface (CLI). The fee for creating a VerusID is 100 VRSC, or 80 VRSC when using a referral. These fees go 100% to miners and stakers. It's a great way to create a decentralized identity on the blockchain and have full control over it.",
