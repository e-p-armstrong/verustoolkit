    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI came across the Verus Coin Foundation and I'm not quite sure what it's about. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Coin Foundation is a foundation that receives proceeds from the sale of physical coins on VerusGear.com. The coins sold are attached to VerusIDs and offer additional benefits, such as access to a special Gold DAO for gold coin owners.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I was thinking of supporting the foundation by buying some merchandise. What kind of merchandise is available for purchase to support the Verus Coin Foundation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find a variety of merchandise on VerusGear.com, including Verus t-shirts, sweaters, stickers, mousepads, hats, flags, and face masks. A significant portion of the profit (at least 20%) from these sales goes to the Verus Coin Foundation, so you'll be supporting a great cause while showing off your Verus spirit!",
