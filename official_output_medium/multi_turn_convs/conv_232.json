    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand the Verus project better. What is the main focus of developers in the Verus project?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main focus of developers in the Verus project is on the core protocols. While this is being developed, additional work is still needed on user-facing apps to roll out a Community Currency for broad use. It's an exciting time for the project, and I'm happy to help you learn more about it.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been thinking about the value of currencies. What gives value to a currency, according to the laws of supply and demand?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! The value of a currency comes from the demand for holders to hold the currency. In other words, the collective use of a currency by its users gives it its value. This is a fundamental principle of economics, and it's crucial to understanding how currencies work.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I've also been reading about Community Contributed Value. What is Community Contributed Value, and how does it relate to a local community's use of a prevailing currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCommunity Contributed Value refers to the value created by a community through its demand for a prevailing currency. This value is a result of the community's aggregate use and holdings of the currency. While it may be a small fraction of the overall value of the currency, it can still be a relatively large amount of value from the community's point of view.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What is the current situation with Community Contributed Value at the local level?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrently, at the local level, communities have zero control over their own Community Contributed Value and do not experience much, if any, local benefit from it. The aggregate of all Community Contributed Value worldwide is centralized in the hands of a few entities. This is a key issue that the Verus project aims to address by empowering local communities to take control of their own Community Contributed Value.",

Rolling out a Community Currency for broad use would still require some additional work on user-facing apps.\nThe Problem\nLike any other good, money is ruled by the laws of supply and demand. A currency in high use requires a constant float of supply to be circulating through its system. In the case of a fiat currency, the demand for holders to hold the currency gives it its value. In other words, as users of a currency, we collectively give value to that currency by our use. For something like the United States Dollar, its value comes from use in its domestic economy, as the global reserve currency, as the petrodollar, as the primary numeraire in financial markets, as the base currency for most foreign and corporate debt, as a predominant store of value, etc. etc. If we live in the United States and we zoom in, looking at our own local community, we can see that we are providing some small fraction of value to the overall value of the USD through our community\u2019s aggregate use and holdings. However small that might be in relation to the global forces of supply and demand, it might still be a relatively large amount of value when considered from the community\u2019s point of view. Little work has been done in quantifying this actual value provided by a community through its demand for a prevailing currency, but new technical tools might allow us to see this more clearly through actual experience. That\u2019s what this sample case study is about \u2014 let\u2019s call this value created by a community, \u201cCommunity Contributed Value\u201d.\nObserving this in the world today, the first thing we see is that, at the local level, we have zero control of our own Community Contributed Value, nor do we experience much, if any, local benefit from it.
