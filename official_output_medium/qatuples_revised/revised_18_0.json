    "How does Verus prevent cheating on its blockchain, and what motivates the network to participate in catching cheaters?",
    "Verus has a decentralized anti-cheat process that doesn't require special layers, filtering, or centralization. The process is built into Verus mining software, and it allows \"cheat hunters\" to scan and find cheated transactions within 100 blocks. These cheated rewards are visible and locked up in \"immaturity\", and the miner who mines the block at which the cheater reward matures is likely to spend the cheater's block reward.",
    "need for any special layers, filtering or convolution, or centralization to be added.\nIt\u2019s also a completely decentralized solution, motivating the entire network to participate in finding and catching cheaters. After all, for 100 blocks any such cheated rewards will be visible and locked up in \u201cimmaturity\u201d, giving motivated \u201ccheat hunters\u201d the opportunity scan and find such transactions.\nThis decentralized anti-cheat process will be built into Verus mining software, meaning the most likely person to spend the cheater\u2019s block reward will be the miner who mines the block at which the cheater reward matures.\nAnd in the meantime, that other staked block, the one that gave away the cheater, is unable to be double spent. Because the rule is in place that only allows the UTXO to be spent once by either the owner/originator or the cheat hunter.\nUnpacking the Technical Stuff\nBy \u201crewiring\u201d the way in which Verus performs staking, the blockchain is approaching staking fundamentally similar to how mining works. Within Verus you have the same probabilistic selection based on Staking Power as with Proof of Work. This means you don\u2019t have to pre-invest stake, in order to stake.\nThe Verus blockchain inherently makes staking equivocal with mining in probability, fairness, and security while obliterating the nothing at stake problem and weak subjectivity (which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment)\u2026resulting in a blockchain that is arguably more robust, secure, and capable than a simple PoW chain.\nVerus Crypto Conditions\nCrypto Conditions, or CC, are smart contracts for Komodo-based blockchains. Developed by Komodo, CCs extend the capabilities of a bitcoin-type blockchain to allow more functionality and scripting on the blockchain level.\nTo effectively use CCs for Verus\u2019 purposes, Mike extended some of the capabilities of Crypto Conditions, particularly adding more meta data definitions and allow",
