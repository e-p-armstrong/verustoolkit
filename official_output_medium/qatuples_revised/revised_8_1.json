    "What are automated market makers, and how do they work?",
    "Automated market makers are a new financial primitive that has emerged with the advent of smart contract-enabled blockchains, such as Ethereum. They work by attracting token holders to lock their tokens in liquidity pools, which act as an always-ready counterparty able to transact with any user at an algorithmically determined price. This allows for asynchronous price discovery, replacing the traditional bid/ask, order-matching paradigm.",
    " emerge under low-cost conditions, and that this liquidity will provide the lowest friction, lowest cost, lowest risk, fairest conversion transactions for the crypto and wider financial communities.\nVerus is concurrently in the advanced stages of completing decentralized bridging technology which will allow other blockchain ecosystems (including Ethereum and its ERC-20s) to be represented on the Verus system in a decentralized manner.\nAutomated Market Makers and Community Driven Liquidity\nThe era of smart contract enabled blockchains, pioneered by Ethereum, has allowed the creation of new financial primitives. Among the most important of these are automated market makers. Brought to the Ethereum blockchain in 2017, they have developed into a popular new paradigm for conversion of one financial instrument to another. By attracting ERC20 holders to lock their tokens in so-called liquidity pools, the reserves in these pools act as an always-ready counterparty able to transact with any user at an algorithmically determined price. Prior to this, all price discovery in crypto markets had been through the bid/ask, order-matching paradigm. Automated market makers replace the order book with on-chain reserves, allowing asynchronous price discovery. The recently surging use of Ethereum-based liquidity pools speaks to the power of the model.\nNotwithstanding the success so far, there have been various drawbacks and concerns with the community liquidity solutions that have been employed. The highest profile problems have been cases where the smart contracts involved have errors in design or execution that were overlooked, leading to catastrophic loss for liquidity providers. But other large problems have emerged, including front-running, latency wars, gas price rigging and high transaction costs. Less noticed drawbacks include sub-optimal use of all available liquidity in a system",
