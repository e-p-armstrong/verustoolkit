    "How do I enable StakeGuard in the Verus CLI wallet?",
    "To enable StakeGuard in the Verus CLI wallet, you can either:\n\n1. Edit your VRSC.conf file and add a line with the format `cheatcatcher=ZADDR`.\n2. Pass the StakeGuard address as a parameter to `verusd` when launching, using the format `-cheatcatcher=\"ZADDR\"`.",
    "With your private address copied, click on the gear icon in the upper right corner to enter settings, then click on Coin Settings on the left. Make sure Verus(VRSC) is selected in the dropdown right below the settings icon. Then paste your private address into the StakeGuard address field and save your changes.That\u2019s it for the GUI.\nTo enable StakeGuard in the CLI wallet you\u2019ll edit your VRSC.conf file and add a z-address in a line formatted like this:\ncheatcatcher=ZADDR\nor pass it as a parameter to verusd when launching using the parameter like so:\n-cheatcatcher=\u201dZADDR\u201d\nUTXO Details\nA few notes on some of the finer points of staking \u2014 you can ignore this part and do just fine with staking, but this might be useful to you if you\u2019re looking for the slightly deeper dive.\nThe balance in your wallet is made up of the sum of the transactions that have been sent to an address or VerusID in your wallet that haven\u2019t been spent. When you\u2019re staking it is actually each individual unspent transaction output (UTXO) that\u2019s eligible to stake.\nWhen a UTXO stakes it is actually spent, being sent back to the same address again. This means it still shows up in your balance, but it becomes ineligible to stake again for 150 blocks. For the next 150 blocks after a stake you\u2019ll notice that the value of the UTXO that staked will be missing from your eligible staking balance, but also notice that your other UTXOs remain eligible to stake during",
