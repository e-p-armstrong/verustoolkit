    "What is the purpose of the Verus monthly recap?",
    "The Verus monthly recap is intended to fill the information gap for people who don't have the time or desire to follow Verus's social media or Discord channels on a daily basis. It provides a summary of the latest project information and updates on Verus and its ecosystem, allowing readers to stay informed without having to constantly monitor multiple sources.",
