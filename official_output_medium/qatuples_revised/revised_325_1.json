    "How does Stake Guard work to prevent cheating in Verus?",
    "Stake Guard works by allowing miners and stakers to set a \"cheatcatcher\" zs-address parameter. When a cheater is detected, the cheater's coinbase is sent to the miner or staker's zs-address, preventing the cheater from spending it. This is not a creation of new coins, but rather the redistribution of the cheater's own coinbase.",
    "d to spend the coinbase in question.\nAny miner or staker who sets the \u201ccheatcatcher\u201d zs-address parameter may find an additional shielded coinbase in their cheat catching address! Again, this is not new coins being created, it\u2019s literally spending the cheaters single \u201clegitimate\u201d coinbase from the block height at which they cheated, sending it to your zs-address before they can spend it.\nMiners and stakers may also earn a cheat reward from Stake Guard when they don\u2019t earn a normal block reward as it is an equally fair functionality (when enabled) across the entire network of miners and stakers, not weighted by staking or mining power, rather dependent on which wallet \u201csees\u201d the identifiable cheated fork.\nBeyond setting your wallet up to catch cheaters, another important implication of this advancement is to also ensure you are not inadvertently cheating. If you stake on the same wallet across multiple computers, you will most likely lose your staked rewards. You should only stake from one wallet per computer at any time. While you can open the same wallet on two computers, make sure only one of those is staking and the other is not to avoid losing your coinbase rewards!\nHow to Enable Stake Guard:\nEnabling Stake Guard is simple. Following are steps for both CLI and GUI.\nFor CLI Wallet:\nFirst generate a new Sapling-type zs-address with command: \n ./verus-cli/verus z_getnewaddress sapling which will echo back your new zs-address.\nStart your Verus daemon with the parameter -cheatcatcher=zsaddr where \u201czsaddr\u201d is your new zs-address.\nFor example, to start the daemon staking and with Stake Guard enabled, you would run: ./verus-cli/verusd -mint -cheatcatcher=zsaddr\nFor GUI Wallet:\nFirst generate a new Sapling-type zs-address from the Send section by choosing \u201cPrivate Address (Sapling)\u201d from the Get New Address drop down:",
