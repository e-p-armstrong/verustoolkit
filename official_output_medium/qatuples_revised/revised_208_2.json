    "What is Verus Vault, and how does it enhance the security of identities on the Verus network?",
    "Verus Vault is a staking-capable time locking and theft prevention system that allows identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. It enables a virtually theft-proof workflow and provides a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, and identity theft.",
    "the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.\nThe Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or CLI wallets as VRSCTEST, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are not available on any other decentralized platform today.\n1. Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) with zero-knowledge privacy support (VerusID) \u2014 Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.\nThe Verus network and all PBaaS chains also support zk-SNARK, zero-knowledge privacy for private transactions and messages. When combined with VerusID, Verus becomes the only blockchain network in the world with zero knowledge privacy with friendly-name IDs.\n2. Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault) \u2014 Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds.\nWhen locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user\u2019s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The Verus",
