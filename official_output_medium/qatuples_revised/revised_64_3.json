    "What are the benefits of using Verus's multi-reserve system and throttled exposure for investors?",
    "Verus's multi-reserve system and throttled exposure provide investors with the opportunity to achieve balanced exposure without fees, and to reduce risk by averaging up and down. They also offer liquidity providers the chance to \"yield farm\" through conversion fees, making it an attractive option for those seeking to manage their investments in a more flexible and risk-controlled way.",
    "ction fees for selling and acquiring the coins (plus occasional market slippage in that process). It can also only vaguely approximate the desired hoped for strategy. In a multi-reserve, exposure is retained at 25/25/25/25 automatically, without fees, and is done on every block \u2014 a significant advance for all who seek to stay with balanced exposure despite market moves.\nIt\u2019s important to note, as described above, that a self-rebalancing portfolio would be susceptible to impermanent loss. Accordingly, in order to counteract this, and to attract providers who are interested in self-rebalancing, Verus includes the already described conversion fees. At a minimum, these fees should be sufficient to counteract any impermanent loss. Also possible though, is the result that the conversion fees will exceed the impermanent loss experienced by a provider \u2014 this is because impermanent loss is not \u201cpermanent\u201d in the sense that it appears and disappears only insofar as conversion ratios diverge from those that prevailed when a provider acquired the multi-reserve currency. So, in the example of highly used conversion \u201cpools\u201d where those rates eventually return to those prevailing when the provider entered the system, there would be no impermanent loss but the provider would still enjoy conversion fees that were generated along the way. Such situations give liquidity providers the opportunity to \u201cyield farm\u201d.\nA second \u201cdestination\u201d for investors is that they can achieve \u201cthrottled exposure\u201d to an asset. Throttled exposure is the opposite of leverage and can be used to reduce risk, or to mirror, for example, the strategy of constantly selling down an appreciating asset, or constantly \u201cdollar cost averaging down\u201d with a falling asset. This throttling, or averaging up and down is also done automatically, with no fees, on every block more than a thousand times a day.\nFinally, while liqui",
