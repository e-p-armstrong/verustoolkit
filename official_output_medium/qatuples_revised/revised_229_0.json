    "How can I create a crowdfunding-style token launch with a minimum funding requirement using Verus?",
    "Verus provides tools that allow you to create a crowdfunding-style token launch with a minimum funding requirement. You can set a minimum funding goal, and if it's not met, contributors will automatically receive their funds back.",
    "one in a crowd-funding fashion and similar to Kickstarter, a minimum can be assigned and if it is not met, the contributors will automatically receive their funds back. The tools on testnet also allow the coin creator to set dynamic currency launch pricing based on participation, such as pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carve outs, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations.\nMassively Parallel Merge Mining\nWhile the 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge-mineable along with Verus and up to 21 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and securing all chains simultaneously, without needing additional power in the mining software. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens and for native zk-SNARK supporting currencies as well.\nIf the PBaaS chain is a reserve chain, these rewards can be converted into VRSC, increasing the incentive to miners to secure the Verus ecosystem. For staking, the same incentive applies, but is limited only by the amount of chains your system is capable of running in native mode (think full node with entire blockchain).",
