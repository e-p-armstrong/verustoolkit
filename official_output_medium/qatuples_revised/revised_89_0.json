    "What benefit do I get if I move my ETH, DAI, and MKR to the Verus blockchain before the bridge is launched?",
    "If you move your ETH, DAI, and MKR to the Verus blockchain before the bridge is launched, your cross-chain fees are subsidized. The Verus blockchain uses around 5000 VRSC to subsidize the fees on its side. After the bridge currency is launched, the remaining VRSC will be put into the reserves.",
    "If you move ETH, DAI and MKR over to the Verus blockchain before the bridge is launched your cross-chain fees are subsidized. Around 5000 VRSC is used to subsidize the fees on the Verus side. When the bridge currency gets launched, the VRSC that is left will be put into the reserves.\nDynamic Supply\nThe Bridge.vETH supply is dynamic (after the preconversion has finished and the bridge currency is launched). The currency gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, vETH, DAI.vETH and MKR.vETH, or gets burned when people convert out of it.\nAfter the bridge currency is launched you can convert into any direction.\nWorth noting: Verus DeFi is MEV-resistant. There is no front/back-running since all conversions are simultaneously solved within a block. More details on docs.verus.io\nThe Bridge.vETH currency function is to make the bridging of assets simple. From wherever you send it converts the fees that you need seamlessly.\nThe Bridge Accrues Fees\nThe bridge currency accrues fees with the cross-chain functions, conversions and .vETH VerusID registrations, making it more valuable the more it\u2019s used.\nDai holders get 5% interest (at the time of writing, the rate is subject to change by MakerDAO) automatically when holding in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. DAI in Bridge.vETH and in the complete Verus ecosystem get this savings rate. The DSR is being passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH.Use the Bridge\nAfter Bridge.vETH is launched and the initial supply is distributed you can now use the bridge as follows:\nConvert into any direction after the currency is launched and out of preconversion mode.\nExport launched currencies on Verus as an ERC-20. \ud83d\udc49 Learn how\nLaunch currencies on Verus that are 1:1 mapped to any ERC-20. \ud83d\udc49 Learn how\nSend currencies, tokens and liquidity pools cross-chain.\nSend ERC-721 & ERC-1155 NFTs to Verus, and export tokenized ID currenc",
