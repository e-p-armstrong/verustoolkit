(You can skip this section if you\u2019re already familiar with them.)\nMost cryptocurrencies use a pairing of public and private keys to create their addresses. You use a string of numbers and letters derived from a public key to deposit funds. Though it\u2019s good practice to keep a public key secret, it doesn\u2019t have to be kept secret because it can\u2019t be used for withdrawals.\n\u00b7 An example Bitcoin address:\n1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2\n\u00b7 An example Ethereum address:\n 0x89205A3A3b2A69De6Dbf7f01ED13B2108B2c43e7\nPrivate keys, on the other hand, have the power to spend.
