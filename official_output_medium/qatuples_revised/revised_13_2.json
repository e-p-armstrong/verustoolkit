    "What is subjectivity in blockchain, and how does it relate to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms?",
    "Subjectivity in blockchain refers to the theory that there can be multiple potential versions of a blockchain that appear correct. In Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, subjectivity is a concern because there is no objective chain with the most proven computational work to find the correct ledger. This means that the software being used to connect to the blockchain may have difficulty choosing between different versions of the blockchain.",
    "lock, and submits the vote to determine if the staker won. It\u2019s essentially a \u201cfree vote\u201d, besides the cost of crypto funds in the staker\u2019s wallet to participate.\nNothing at Stake\nWith \u201cvoting\u201d on the next block not requiring expensive computational power or external costs such as electricity, etc, as in PoW, staking is essentially a cost-free endeavor. The only cost involved is the stake of the blockchain\u2019s currency into the staking wallet.\nA normal outcome in any blockchain is when more than one block is generated simultaneously. In cases such as this, in a normal and cheat free chain, one block is kept and the chain keeps building on down that path\u2026while the other block is orphaned.\nWith generating a vote being free with no intensive computer work necessary, what\u2019s to stop a nefarious staker from casting a double vote? One for the block upon which the chain continues to build..and one on the orphaned or \u201cforked\u201d chain as well? In fact, since votes are free, why not generate many votes every block, to potentially multiply block rewards\u2026effectively double spending on the network?\nThis, in a very basic nutshell, is known as the \u201cnothing at stake\u201d problem which is theorized as an argument against PoS being a good and secure consensus mechanism. This nothing at stake problem results in a threat to the security, reliability and immutability of a blockchain and therefore threatens it\u2019s existence.\nWeak Subjectivity\nSubjectivity in blockchain is the theory that there can be multiple potential versions of a blockchain which appear correct. This is fine so long as the software being used to connect to the blockchain cannot automatically choose between these.\nSubjectivity is discussed in Proof of Stake because, unlike Proof of Work, there is no objective chain with most proven computational work to find the correct ledger.\nWeak Subjectivity specifically, is the theory that sub",
