    "What is the Proof of Power (VerusPoP) mechanism, and how does it provide security for the Verus network?",
    "The Proof of Power (VerusPoP) mechanism is the foundational security mechanism for the Verus network. It makes it extremely difficult for an attacker to launch a 51% attack, as they would need to control over 50% of both the chain's hashpower and its coin supply.",
    "a system that places cryptographic security at its heart. The success of this is self-evident, as the bitcoin system itself has operated openly and continuously since inception, with elegant simplicity and effectively zero security incidents at the protocol level, all while protecting value now measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars.\nVerus shares this philosophy, with cryptographic security as a foundational element of the system. Verus builds on bitcoin, expanding the system beyond payment and into other blockchain primitives such as privacy, finance, identification, data, and interoperability with other decentralized and centralized systems. Verus includes these elements at the protocol level. Still, like bitcoin, Verus uses the UTXO accounting method as opposed to an account-based accounting method, an important benefit of which is that transactions (eg. defi) can be trivially verified in parallel. The philosophy of this structure is to provide a foundation to build global distributed systems and applications. It is the basis to reconstruct computer usage.\nAs part of its philosophy for \u201csecurity as the ground state\u201d, Verus has settled on the Proof of Power mechanism as the foundational security for its network. Although taking over a chain that uses VerusPoP is not impossible, doing so with a 51% attack would require a combined value of over 50% of both the chain\u2019s hashpower and its coin supply. In addition, Verus has built \u201cquantum-ready\u201d capabilities. It remains only to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, following which it will be possible to have all of the transactions sent to an address made retroactively quantum resistant.\nDecentralized Systems Provide Robust, Open Public Infrastructure\nAs Satoshi Nakamato has pointed out in his white paper, a decentralized network has unique elements:\nThe network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.
