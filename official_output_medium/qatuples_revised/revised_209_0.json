    "What are some challenges that social tokens face in terms of liquidity provision and maintaining value?",
    "Social tokens face several challenges in terms of liquidity provision and maintaining value. One major issue is the high risk of impermanent loss for liquidity providers in automated market makers, which can lead to a lack of liquidity provision and unstable token values. Additionally, the value of social tokens is often tightly linked to a creator's ongoing real-world efforts to provide experiences, events, or products, which can be unsustainable and lead to a rapid loss of value if the creator's activity stalls. As a result, many social tokens ultimately lose value and become forgotten.",
    "kill\nautomated market making \u2014 they help set up Uniswap-like liquidity provision, but to gain actual liquidity creators must, in the words of the Roll website: \u201cencourage their communities to contribute liquidity\u201d\nhanding creators a roadmap and examples to \u201cbuild value\u201d \u2014 this generally involves activities, services or products that creators will offer to their fans so that they can get their communities to buy the token and then trade the token for these goods \u2014 the idea is to generate real-world demand for the tokens\nOn the roll website, this last concept is pitched as: \u201cAfter minting, you determine all the ways your token will be distributed and used across platforms, closing the loop that gives your social token its own independent value and starts your social token economy.\u201d. But, as described in this article, \u201cI discovered that it\u2019s just a sh**tload of work to keep a token going\u201d.\nThe end result is that value in social tokens remains fleeting or aspirational. Liquidity through liquidity provision in automated market makers can be a big problem. For a liquidity provider, risks are high, probably untenable since impermanent loss risk in an AMM with a fragile token approaches 100%. It turns out that liquidity provision in this context is a wholly altruistic activity, or worse, done by people who are unaware of the enormous risks. WIth minimal liquidity provision comes little market depth and unstable value.\nAlso, value for the token is tightly locked to a creator\u2019s ongoing real world efforts to provide experiences, or events, or products, in order to drive continuous demand for the currency. There are no automated economic activities. If the creator\u2019s activity stalls, or dries up, the token will lose value rapidly. Predictably, the vast bulk of these currencies peter out, and are forgotten, living on as zombie ERC-20s on ethereum.\nNo Long Tail\nAnyone that\u2019s really ",
