    "When you define a currency on Verus using the command line, you will receive a HEX code in response. This HEX code must be used in a transaction to broadcast the currency launch to the network.",
    "arn more about the many different launch options when defining a currency on Verus, go here \ud83d\udd17 We encourage anyone to start testing the protocol to get ahead of the game. The community is happy to help on Discord \ud83d\udd17\nWhen we do the command above we get returned a HEX. Only after we make a transaction with the HEX, will the currency launch be broadcasted to the network. See below:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction \"hex\"\nNow you can see the currency on the Verus network. We just need to make sure it\u2019s on Ethereum as well.\nExporting the mapped currency\nNow, let\u2019s export the currency from Verus to Ethereum as an ERC-20 over the non-custodial bridge. We do this with the following command:\n./verus chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"MaxUSDC@\" '[{\n \"address\":\"0xAD84C9EE28FB4c3b9C6ef1B86D1ED00A82DB84E9\", \n \"currency\":\"MaxUSDC\", \n \"amount\":0, \n \"exportto\":\"veth\", \n \"exportcurrency\":true, \n \"feecurrency\":\"veth\"\n}]'\nNote: the first MaxUSDC@ field is the change address for fees being returned to you, and the address is the Verus-Ethereum non-custodial smart contract bridge address. You can also omit feecurrency if you would rather pay the export fees in VRSCTEST.\nAfter the bridge has been notarized to the blockheight where you have exported the currency, you can choose it from the token dropdown on the bridge website \ud83d\udd17.\nERC-20s on Verus\nAfter sending from Ethereum to Verus, the token is free to move through the Internet of Value on the Verus network, across PBaaS-blockchains, and also back & forth with Ethereum.\nAs easily as the token was first defined and launched, it can now become one of the reserves in a multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM as part of Verus DeFi.\nAnybody can define a multi-reserve currency which includes MaxUSDC as a reserve with weighted percentage (10\u201390%). The reserves grow as they retain a small fee whenever assets are traded in/out/through.\nA multi-re",
