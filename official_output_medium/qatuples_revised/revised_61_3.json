    "You can get involved with the Verus community by connecting to the bridge, joining the community on Discord, following on Twitter, and visiting verus.io. You can also learn more about the protocol by reading the documentation on docs.verus.io, which provides information on how to use many API commands, such as launching currencies, tokens, and liquidity pools.",
    "ny miner and staker can, and thus also get part of the fees.\nNotarizations made on Verus always contain a stateroot from Ethereum that is a minimum of 30 blocks old (blocks on Ethereum take ~15 seconds) to make sure it is stable. Then after Verus has confirmed the notarization with a new one, Verus can accept transactions (CCE) from Ethereum, along with the Ethereum Merkle Patricia Trie proof that relates to the new confirmed data.\nA Giant Leap Forward\nThe delayed sending of transactions is an important security mechanism that is not present in any other cross-chain bridge. To recap: before any real transactions happen, the Verus network sends proofs to the Ethereum network and vice versa. These proofs are checked and agreed upon by everyone in the network. Only then the actual moving of assets happens. Because of this delayed system, no single entity ever gets control over the assets. Also there are safeguards in place for the community notaries that protect users from hacks.\nThis system is decentralized, which means it\u2019s controlled by everyone participating in the network, rather than a single central authority. It\u2019s a giant leap forward for the entire cryptocurrency industry, and everyone can be a part of it!\nJoin the community. Learn about the protocol. Use Verus & build.\n\ud83d\udc49 Connect to the bridge\nVerus-Ethereum Bridge webpage\n\u27a1\ufe0f Join the community on Discord\nFollow on Twitter\nGo to verus.io\nTry Yourself! \u2705\nLook up docs.verus.io to use many API commands (e.g. launching currencies, tokens & liquidity pools).\nOr look up the complete command list here.",
