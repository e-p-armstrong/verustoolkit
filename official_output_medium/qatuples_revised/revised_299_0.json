    "What is the concept of \"Community Contributed Value\" in the context of fiat currency and the US government?",
    "The concept of \"Community Contributed Value\" refers to the aggregate value created by the community through their economic activities, which is then captured and utilized by the government and powerful private forces adjacent to it, such as Wall Street and the Defense Industry, due to their proximity to the controller of the USD.",
    "he US government. In the fiat period, as the master of the global reserve currency, the US government has proven that this aggregate value is enormous, allowing the government and country to run persistently high budget and trade deficits, and expand the money supply at will, while still maintaining a strong dollar.\nIn addition, although specific research is hard to find on this issue, it does seem as if powerful private forces that are adjacent to the United States Government, such as Wall Street and the Defense Industry, are conferred certain advantages through their proximity to the controller of the USD. Connected and powerful people and corporations may be, directly or indirectly, tapping into this Community Contributed Value.\nSolutions \u2014 pre-Blockchain\nAll of this is obvious enough to have given rise to a long history of efforts to start local community currencies, to keep some of this contributed value in the community. Prior to the development of the blockchain, these efforts really seem to have been doomed from the start. Currency issuance in the paper money world is difficult to control and has huge security and moral hazard issues (counterfeit, over-issuance, etc). These currencies cannot easily be made transparent, or auditable. The funds can\u2019t be reasonably saved or protected in banks. There is no plausible way to have readily available conversion at market rates between the community currency and the USD, nor is it plausible to keep a local currency at a stable and predictable value. For users, using community currency was hard, and for communities, making community currency was hard \u2014 and so, except for a handful (or less), every effort ran aground.\nSolutions \u2014 in the Dawn of the Blockchain Era\nInterest in community currencies perked up in the blockchain era, as it became clear that auditable, transparent tokens could be created at will (eg. ERC-20s), a",
