    "What is the purpose of the new documentation website being developed for Verus, and what kind of information can I expect to find there?",
    "The new documentation website is being created to provide in-depth information about Verus blockchain technology. It will serve as a resource for those who want to delve deeper into the technical aspects of Verus. The website will be regularly updated to reflect changes and advancements in the technology.",
    "Mobile Wallet Developments\nInteresting progress on the mobile development front. Verus Mobile will be able to function as an encrypted local repository for your personal data, creating a central place for you to securely store information about yourself (that only you control.) This data allows you to integrate your wallet with in-app service providers that extend application functionality. Initially, this is how fiat on/off ramp services (Wyre) will be connected to the wallet. Later on, VerusID integration gives users the power to prove information about themselves in a decentralized, self-sovereign way. Exciting stuff!\n\nNew Docs Website\nIn addition to the new website we are working on a documentation website. In here you can find information if you want to take a deeper dive into Verus blockchain technology. It will be online the same time as the new website. Although this one is still a work-in-progress and needs to be updated constantly.\nCommunity-Made Videos\nCommunity member tango808 made an awesome video showing current and near future capabilities. Check it out on YouTube. He made even way more and you can find them here. Please share them around if you want!\nEcosystem Project Valu\nCommunity member Consilience from Valu low-key confirmed that they will launch their project soon after PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) has been brought to mainnet. One of those things are fiat gateways for Verus. It will be a giant boost for the ecosystem I\u2019m sure.\nFun Fact\nAt the time of writing the active amount of $VRSC staking is over 33M. Not bad. Still room for improvement. So get staking! Or not (more for me.)\nThanks for reading. That\u2019s it from me. Until next month!\nPlease subscribe to the monthly recap so you\u2019ll get it each month in your mailbox.",
