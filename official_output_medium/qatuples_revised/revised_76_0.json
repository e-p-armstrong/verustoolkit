    "What is recommended for securing my email account when setting up a DigitalOcean account for Verus?",
    "It is recommended to use ProtonMail and set the encryption to the highest level while setting up your account from a secure device, not a public or shared computer. Additionally, enabling Two Factor Authentication (2FA) with Google Authenticator or Authy is recommended for added security.",
    "ail\nPersonally I recommend using ProtonMail and setting the encryption to the Highest while setting up your account. Do this from a device you know for certain is secure, not a public or shared computer.\nProtonMail has a Two Factor Authentication option, which I recommend turning on. You\u2019ll need to use either Google Authenticator or Authy for generating 2FA codes. Make sure you secure this app! If you use Authy make sure to password protect the app and ensure that \u201cAllow Multi-device\u201d is disabled for maximum security.\nDigital Ocean\nNext, you\u2019ll need a DigitalOcean account in which we\u2019ll be setting up the \u201cDroplet\u201d server. I recommend using the new secure email you setup and once you\u2019ve got your account setup, turn 2FA on within your DigitalOcean settings as well.\nDigitalOcean Droplets are VM Servers that are fast and easy to deploy and can be scaled up or down. In this guide I\u2019m showing you how to setup a very basic, small (1vCPU/1GB RAM) droplet which is only $5 a month.\nBecause it\u2019s such a small server with very limited resources, there are a few things we\u2019ll be doing which a \u201cnormal\u201d server would not require. Latest Sapling activation makes it a breeze to use a minimal server tasks, such as shielding and private transactions, which used to take several minutes\u2026now are near 1 second and even faster!\nNow that you have a new shiny email and Digital Ocean account, everything is secured, it\u2019s time to setup your droplet.\nPart Two \u2014 Create The Droplet\nStep 1\nFrom the top right of your dashboard in DigitalOcean, click the Create button and then select \u201cDroplets\u201d",
