    "Will I stake blocks frequently if I have a small amount of Verus?",
    "If you have a relatively small amount of Verus, your staking rewards may be very infrequent. However, there's always a chance you'll stake a block, and over a sufficiently long time, there's a good chance you'll stake at some point.",
    "n with the community on the Verus Discord. If you describe your issue in the community-support or staking channels they\u2019ll be able to help, or can put your mind at ease.\nOne point of confusion worth reviewing \u2014 staking on Verus doesn\u2019t provide a steady trickle of proceeds, instead it is all-or-nothing in each block, earning the full block reward plus fees each time, and the frequency with which you stake a block is based on the amount of Verus you have staking. It\u2019s also all a matter of statistical averages, you may have lucky periods and dry spells, the specifics of when you stake and when you don\u2019t are matters of utter randomness and should even out over long periods of time as a matter of averages. If you have a relatively small amount of Verus your staking rewards may be very infrequent, but there\u2019s always a chance, and over a sufficiently long time there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll stake at some point.\nGood luck and happy staking!",
