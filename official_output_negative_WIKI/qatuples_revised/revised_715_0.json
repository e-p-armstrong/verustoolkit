    "How do I determine when an immature block will mature by checking the number of blocks in the blockchain?",
    "You don't determine when an immature block will mature by checking the number of blocks in the blockchain. Instead, you need to get the values of the current block height (\"blocks\") and the \"blockstomaturity\" (the distance to maturity of the transaction in question). Then, you can apply the formula: blockstomaturity / 1440 = days to maturity (unlocking).",
    "# Question: How do I know when an immature block will \"unlock\" (mature)?\n\n## Procedure:\n1. Get the values of the current block height (\"blocks\") and the \"blockstomaturity\" the distance to maturity of the transaction in question. (i.e. the number of blocks between current block height and where it unlocks. You can see the number is decreasing all the time, and if you add it to the current block height you'll see a constant.)\n2. Apply this formula: blockstomaturity / 1440 = days to maturity (unlocking)\n  e.g. 925558/1440=643 days\n\n(submitted by @J Oliver Westbrook, edited by @elvinsophus )",
