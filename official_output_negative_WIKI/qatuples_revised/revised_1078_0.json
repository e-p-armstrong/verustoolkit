    "How do I verify the signature of a downloaded archive without using the extracted text file?",
    "You can't. The txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is included for each download, and it's necessary to extract this file to verify the signature. The CLI examples provided demonstrate how to verify the file directly or using a checksum, both of which require the extracted text file.",

There are no actual protocol changes.The ETH bridge upgrade introduces the ability to enter notarizations between Ethereum Goerli and VRSCTEST using bridgekeeper without an Ethereum private key in your conf file. This will enable you to still mine and potentially earn by agreeing or disagreeing with notarizations mined into the Verus blockchain, without needing to make transactions on or spend Ethereum for fees. This should also work with a free Infura account.",
