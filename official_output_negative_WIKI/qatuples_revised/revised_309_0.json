    "Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky not flag Verus software as malicious?",
    "Actually, Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which are warnings that you are installing mining software that could be used to exploit your PC if installed by a third party. This is not because the software is malicious, but because it is mining software that could be used for malicious purposes.",
