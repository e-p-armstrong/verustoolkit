    "Can I use the `currencyconverters` API to retrieve currencies that have a VRSC reserve ratio of less than 10%?",
    "No, the `currencyconverters` API only retrieves currencies that have a VRSC reserve ratio of greater than 10%. It does not return currencies with a reserve ratio of less than 10%.",
    "currencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nWill return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
