    "How do you send reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and convert it to native currency at a fixed price that you specify?",
    "You can't specify a fixed price. When sending reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting it to native currency, the conversion happens at the current price. This is done using the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{\"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```\nThe `tonative` flag indicates that the amount should be converted to native currency at the current price.",
