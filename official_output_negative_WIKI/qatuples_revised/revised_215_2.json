    "How do I create an identity without paying any fees to referrers or miners?",
    "Unfortunately, that's not possible. According to the protocol, creating an identity involves paying fees to referrers and miners. The fees are distributed as follows: 20 VRSC to the referrer's ID, 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's ID, and 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID, and 20 VRSC to the miner of the block. The remaining funds, which are not paid to referrers, go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.",
