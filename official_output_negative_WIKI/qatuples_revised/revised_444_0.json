    "Can you explain why the `getcurrencystate` command is only available for the current block and not for specific blocks or ranges of blocks?",
    "Actually, the `getcurrencystate` command is available for specific blocks and ranges of blocks, not just the current block. You can use the command with the block number, start and end block numbers, and step size to get the currency state for a specific block or range of blocks. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\nor\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```",
    "**Getting the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block.**\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate\n```\n**... a specific block.**\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\n**... a range with a specific period between**.\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
