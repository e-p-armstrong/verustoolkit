    "Can you only check the difference between staked and mined coins in the VerusExplorer?",
    "No, while the VerusExplorer is one way to check the difference between staked and mined coins, it's not the only method. You can also use the CLI or Verus Desktop to achieve the same result. In the CLI, you can use the `listtransactions` command and check the blockhash of the received award. In Verus Desktop, you can go to the Mining Dashboard and check the rewards listed as `mined` or `minted` in green.",
