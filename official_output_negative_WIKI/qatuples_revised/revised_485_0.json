    "How do I create a multi-signature ID on the mainnet using a single wallet?",
    "You can't create a multi-signature ID on the mainnet using a single wallet. To create a multi-signature ID, you need to have multiple wallets, each containing an additional signing address/ID. You would then need to take the raw hex transaction data to each of these additional wallets, sign the transaction with each wallet, and finally broadcast the signed transaction on the network.",
    "### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)\nCreate transaction, get raw transaction data:\n ```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\nTake the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:\n ```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:\n ```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):\nThe currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent\n`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration",
