    "Can you explain how Verus Vault provides less security for IDs and NFTs compared to other solutions?",
    "Verus Vault actually provides the same level of security for IDs and NFTs as it does for funds, which is a high level of protection. It offers a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, including time locks for various purposes such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This means that Verus Vault provides strong security for all your assets, including IDs and NFTs.",
    "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
