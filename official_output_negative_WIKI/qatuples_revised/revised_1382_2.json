    "What is the purpose of the `change` field in the result of the `z_listreceivedbyaddress` command, and how does it indicate the sender of the note?",
    "The `change` field in the result of the `z_listreceivedbyaddress` command does not indicate the sender of the note. Instead, it indicates whether the address that received the note is also one of the sending addresses. It is a boolean value that is `true` if the receiving address is also a sending address, and `false` otherwise.",
