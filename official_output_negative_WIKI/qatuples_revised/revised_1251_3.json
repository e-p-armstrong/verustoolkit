    "Is the \"branchid\" argument required for every transaction signing?",
    "No, the \"branchid\" argument is optional. It is used to specify the hex representation of the consensus branch id to sign with, and can be used to force signing with consensus rules that are ahead of the node's current height, but it is not required for every transaction signing.",
    "#### Arguments:\n1. \"hexstring\"   (string, required) The transaction hex string\n2. \"prevtxs\"    (string, optional) An json array of previous dependent transaction outputs\n```json\n   [        (json array of json objects, or 'null' if none provided)\n    {\n     \"txid\":\"id\",       (string, required) The transaction id\n     \"vout\":n,         (numeric, required) The output number\n     \"scriptPubKey\": \"hex\",  (string, required) script key\n     \"redeemScript\": \"hex\",  (string, required for P2SH) redeem script\n     \"amount\": value      (numeric, required) The amount spent\n    }\n    ,...\n  ]\n```\n3. \"privatekeys\"   (string, optional) A json array of base58-encoded private keys for signing\n```json\n  [         (json array of strings, or 'null' if none provided)\n   \"privatekey\"  (string) private key in base58-encoding\n   ,...\n  ]\n```\n4. \"sighashtype\"   (string, optional, default=ALL) The signature hash type.
