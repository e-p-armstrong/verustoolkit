    "Do I need to run VRSCTEST to connect to a defined chain?",
    "No, once a chain is made, you only need to run VRSCTEST to merge mine. After the initial connection, a local config file is created, and you can connect to the chain without running VRSCTEST.",
    "Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". These are warnings that you are installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC.\nTo find out more about the false positives, review the following resources:\nhttps://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/\nhttps://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/\nPlease note that this is a test release intended to use with test chains. We do not advise using it for main net.\nDo not use as main wallet**Sample chain definition**:\n```\n./komodo-cli -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [{\"reward\" : 10000000000}], \"notarizationreward\" : 1440000000, \"billingperiod\" : 1440, \"nodes\" : [{\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2500\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"\"}, {\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2501\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"RDyDzC5JB66Y29fzBkamywqEn1PJXTzj8B\"}]}'\n```\nMaximum of 3 eras\nMinimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations.\nMinimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.\nVRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:**\n```\n./komodod -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\nOn first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.# Disclaimer",
