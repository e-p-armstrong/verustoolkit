    "How do I download the Verus software without worrying about viruses or malware, since there's no way to verify the downloads?",
    "Actually, you can verify the downloads. Each download comes with a txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". You can extract the downloaded archive, verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extract the archive to the desired directory.",
