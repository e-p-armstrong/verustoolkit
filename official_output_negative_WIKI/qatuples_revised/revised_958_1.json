    "Can I use the `definecurrency` command to create a token with a maximum supply of 10 satoshis?",
    "When creating a token with the `definecurrency` command, the max supply should be 1 satoshi, not 10 satoshis. This is a requirement for tokenizing ID control, which is a next-generation NFT feature.",
    "We expect the Ethereum bridge to be brought back up on the new Verus testnet within the next day or two. When it is up, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services, and use your metamask to convert or send cross-chain to the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the #pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for mainnet release in the next couple weeks and start building your vision today!## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):- Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`\n### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):\nThe currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```",
