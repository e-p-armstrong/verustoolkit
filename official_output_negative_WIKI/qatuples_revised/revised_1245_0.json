    "How do I verify a download without using a signature?",
    "Actually, verifying a download requires using a signature. A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is included for each download. To verify a download, you need to extract the downloaded archive, verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extract the archive to the desired directory.",

RC3 has some significant and important API additions, including the ability for any ID at all, even sub-IDs, to generate a single token as its currency. That token then enables whoever holds it to have another level of revoke/recover power over the ID, in addition to the normal revocation and recovery authorities, which also still work. This technology is now available in the pre-existing APIs, updateidentity (for changing revocation / recovery authorities), revokeidentity, and recoveryidentity. Please see help for details.",
