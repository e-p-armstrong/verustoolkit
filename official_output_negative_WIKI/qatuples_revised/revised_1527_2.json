    "Why do Avast and Kaspersky flag the software as malware?",
    "Avast and Kaspersky do not necessarily flag the software as malware. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is a mining program that could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not actually malware.",
