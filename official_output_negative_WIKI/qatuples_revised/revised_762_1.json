    "Can I use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST from a single address to multiple recipients on the mainnet?",
    "The command provided in the question is actually for the testnet, not the mainnet. However, on the testnet, you can send VRSCTEST from a single address to multiple recipients using the `sendcurrency` API. The correct command would be similar to:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"charlie@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nAgain, note that testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset.",
