    "Can anyone mint new coins for the \"mycoin\" currency?",
    "No, not anyone can mint new coins for the \"mycoin\" currency. Only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins, as specified by the `proofprotocol` being set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID). This means that the controller has the authority to mint new coins, but others do not.",

That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
