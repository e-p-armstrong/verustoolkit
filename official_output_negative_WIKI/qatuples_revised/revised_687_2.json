    "To sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, can you simply use the `verus signrawtransaction` command with the raw transaction data?",
    "No, that's not correct. To sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, you need to first create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency` and `verus z_getoperationstatus`. Then, you need to take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using `verus signrawtransaction`. Finally, after the last necessary signature is applied, you can broadcast the signed transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.",
