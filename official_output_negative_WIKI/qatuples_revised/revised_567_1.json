    "How do I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have a btc/eth market with exactly 500 VRSC in reserve?",
    "The `getcurrencyconverters` API does not retrieve currencies based on an exact amount of VRSC in reserve. Instead, it retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. To retrieve all currencies that have a btc/eth market at or above the liquidity threshold, you can use the command `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth`.",
