    "How do I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have exactly 500 VRSC in reserve?",
    "The `getcurrencyconverters` API actually retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, not exactly 500 VRSC. To use this API, you can specify the currencies you're interested in, like this:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
    "ueries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n  ```\n  Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
