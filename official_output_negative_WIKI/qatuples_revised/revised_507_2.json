    "The main reason for the upgrade to v0.8.0-4 is to enable support for much larger proofs than was previously possible, among other fixes and improvements.",
    "If you have pending transactions on the bridge, some requested conversions may come back as refunded, and you should receive all amounts expected, less fees. We will not reset the testnet, but within an hour after this availability, the network will resume transaction imports/exports to and from Rinkeby, and anyone who continues running the old version may need to resync to testnet from scratch to continue. If you have upgraded to v0.8.0-4 or do so before connecting again to testnet, you should only see improvement without disruption.I want to thank everyone who participated already in using this testnet and bridge release. I hope we can keep that level of participation or more up, as it has been extremely helpful. Because of all that\u2019s happened on this testnet to date, we were able to make a lot of progress in finding and resolving the following testnet issues in this release:1. Enable support for much larger proofs than was previously possible from systems that either have large proofs required or significantly variable length proofs. Having this capability in the daemon will pave the way for more types of cross-chain proving in the future as well.\n2. Fix failed refunds of conversion transactions attempted after a fractional currency launches, but before it\u2019s preconversion phase is complete. If you sent transactions during this time, you may have stuck refunds that should flow after this upgrade.\n3. Ensure that currencies are marked as \u201claunch complete\u201d immediately after all preconversions have been processed, enabling normal conversions in all directions from that point forward.\n4. Fix an issue that left some import notarizations incomplete and caused cross-chain transfers to wait longer than expected after some imports.\n5. Improve and validate hardening.",
