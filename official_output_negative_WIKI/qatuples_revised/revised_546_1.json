    "The command you provided is not correct. To create mycoin that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you need to specify both GOLD and VRSCTEST in the currencies array, like this: `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'`.
