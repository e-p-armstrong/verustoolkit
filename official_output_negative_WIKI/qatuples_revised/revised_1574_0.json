    "Can you explain why the `definecurrency` command doesn't require the `proofprotocol` parameter to be set?",
    "Actually, the `definecurrency` command does require the `proofprotocol` parameter to be set. In the example provided, `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is equivalent to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":96, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"conversions\":[0.01, 1.0],\"minpreconversion\":[1000,1000]}'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
