    "v0.9.3 RESETS TESTNET AND ADDRESSES ALL KNOWN ISSUES FOUND DURING TESTING ON THE NETWORK. FROM HERE, WE HOPE ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS WILL JOIN IN TRYING OUT ALL FEATURES OF TESTNET TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE FINAL MAINNET RELEASE, WHICH WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS AS SOON AS IT IS CONSIDERED READY AND HARDENED, WILL BE BOTH SMOOTH AND WORLD-CHANGING.IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED TESTNET WITH VERSIONS PRIOR TO v0.9.2, MAKE SURE TO DELETE AND CLEAR ANY EXISTING TESTNET DATA FOLDERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.## Platform Support\n- Debian 9 (Stretch) is no longer supported\n## PROTOCOL RELEASE CANDIDATE RC1\nWith v0.9.3, The Verus PBaaS protocol, including networking, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi, is considered release candidate RC1 for the coming mainnet upgrade. The core developer focus now remains on protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets as well as merge mining for pool servers.## NEW PBAAS CAPABILITIES\nAll PBaaS capabilities, including for application development, are available now on the new Verus testnet. Now would be a good time for development capable projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus\u2019s transformative technologies to do a deep dive on the Verus testnet. These new capabilities in v0.9.3, as well as all those we are familiar with, available nowhere else, will be on mainnet SOON(\u2122):",
