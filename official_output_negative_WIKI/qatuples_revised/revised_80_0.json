    "We expect at least one more non-mandatory release before the mainnet activation, Tuesday at block #2549420, which will add some pool merge mining improvements. Please make sure you update to v1.0.3 or greater before the activation block.### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.#### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.",
