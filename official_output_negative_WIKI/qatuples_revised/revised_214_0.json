    "How do I launch a token, centralized currency, or liquidity basket AMM off-chain on the Verus network?",
    "You can't launch these features off-chain on the Verus network. Verus has added capabilities for on-chain launches of token, centralized currency, and liquidity basket AMMs. This means that these features are launched directly on the Verus blockchain, not off-chain.",
    "Thanks to ejuliano#8606 for suggesting the initial idea that led to the realization that these features could be added quite easily and with very little protocol risk. All of these new capabilities have had full coverage testing and validation over the past week thanks to @Asherda\u2019s leadership on that front.Meanwhile, @alexenglish, @monkins1010, @asherda, quipacorn#5205, and others have been working on the Ethereum bridge deployment in preparation for this release. The testnet will transition to the v1.0.1 protocol with no reset required, Monday, May 8, 2023 4:00:00 PM, UTC.\n# Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.",
