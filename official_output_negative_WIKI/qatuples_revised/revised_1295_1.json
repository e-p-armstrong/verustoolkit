    "How do I use the `gettransaction` command to get information about a specific account?",
    "The `gettransaction` command is used to get detailed information about a specific transaction, not an account. It takes a transaction ID (txid) as an argument, not an account name. For example: `verus gettransaction \"txid\"` would get information about the transaction with the specified txid.\n\nIf you want to get information about a specific account, you would need to use a different command, such as `getreceivedbyaccount` or `getaccount`, depending on what information you're looking for.",
