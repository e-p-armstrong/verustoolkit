    "Is there a specific script required to make a cloud daily backup of wallet.dat that only works with Amazon Web Services (AWS)?",
    "No, that's not true. The script provided works regardless of the cloud service you use, including Google Cloud, AWS, or any other. The script is cloud-agnostic and can be adapted to work with different cloud storage providers.",
    "# How to make a cloud daily backup of wallet.dat?\nNote: I use Google Cloud for my staking wallet and backups but the script works regardless of what you use; if you have timelocked coins, you will have to keep your wallet.dat file secure for a long, long time: it's crucial to maintain secure the staking instance as well as the storage..### Important General Information\n`VRSC Wallet and Data location` on Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC`## Procedure:\nIf you use GCloud:\n* create a new directory where we'll upload the backups (ie: mkdir /home/user/backup)\n* create a storage bucket via GCloud console (ie bucket_verus)\n* mount the bucket on your local machine (syntax is: gcsfuse ; ie gcsfuse bucket_verus /home/user/backup)The script can be crontab scheduled to run daily or you can run it manually; if you schedule it, you have to hardcode the encryption passphrase; otherwise you can input it manually each time. You will have to install gnupg2 to encrypt (`sudo apt-get install gnupg2 gnupg-agent`). As always: be sure to fully understand what the script does and why I left some echos to demonstration/test purposes, you can sefely remove all of them.\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash# Customize the SOURCE and the DEST folders\nSOURCE_FOLDER=/home/XXXXX/.komodo/VRSC/\nDEST_FOLDER=/home/XXXX/backup/BCK_DATE=date +%Y-%m-%d.%H:%MSOURCE_FILE=wallet.dat\nDEST_FILE=$SOURCEFILE\"\"$BCK_DATEENCRYPT_EXT=\".gpg\"# all echo are for test purposes, feel free to delete them\necho check variable\necho SOURCE - $SOURCE_FOLDER\necho SOURCE_FILE - $SOURCE_FILE\necho DEST FILE - $DEST_FILE\necho DEST - $DEST_FOLDER\necho TO_BE_DEL - $DEST_FOLDER$SOURCE_FILEsleep 1cp $SOURCE_FOLDER$SOURCE_FILE $DEST_FOLDER$DEST_FILE\nsleep 1\n# Customize the passphrase!!\ngpg2 --batch --yes -c --cipher-algo AES256 --passphrase=\"XXXXXX\" $DEST_FOLDER$DEST_FILE\nsleep 1\nrm $DEST_FOLDER$DEST_FILE",
