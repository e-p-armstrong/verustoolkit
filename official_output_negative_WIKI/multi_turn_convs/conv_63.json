    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I was wondering about the new Verus testnet. Can you access it with the Verus CLI wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can access the new Verus testnet with the Verus CLI wallet. The released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets support the new Verus testnet. You should be able to connect to the testnet without any issues.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I was also wondering, how do you sign a transaction from a single-signature ID on the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI apologize, but we don't have specific information on signing a transaction from a single-signature ID. However, I can tell you that the process for multi-signature IDs involves creating a transaction, getting the raw transaction data, taking the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs, signing the raw transaction, and then broadcasting the signed transaction on the network. If you need more information on signing transactions, I'd be happy to help with that!\n\n**User:**\nOne more question - is the new Verus testnet a centralized blockchain platform?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the new Verus testnet is an intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform. It allows for unlimited numbers of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains, and provides a wide range of features and functionalities. Verus is designed to be decentralized, so you don't have to worry about a single entity controlling the network.",
