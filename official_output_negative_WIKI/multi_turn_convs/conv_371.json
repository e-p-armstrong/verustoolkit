    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in using Verus ID and NFT Marketplace to sell an NFT. Can you explain how to use them to sell my NFT to a centralized authority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misunderstanding. The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform, which means you don't sell your NFT to a centralized authority. Instead, you can advertise your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. This allows for completely decentralized transactions, where you can execute transactions peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. You have full control over your NFT and the sale process.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I also have a question about Verus Vault. How do I use it to spend funds from a locked VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you cannot spend funds from a locked VerusID when using Verus Vault. If you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. However, you can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network to earn rewards while the VerusID is locked.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question. Do I need to have multiple identities to enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need multiple identities to enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities. You only need one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This is a requirement to enable these features. You can set up multiple IDs to have more control over your Verus experience, but it's not necessary for these specific features.",
