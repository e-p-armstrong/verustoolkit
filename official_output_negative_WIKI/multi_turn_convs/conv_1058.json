    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the different options in Verus, but I'm a bit confused. What is the purpose of the OPTION_NATIVECURRENCY option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. There is no OPTION_NATIVECURRENCY option in Verus. The available options include OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY, OPTION_GATEWAY, OPTION_PBAAS, OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER, OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER, and OPTION_NFT_TOKEN. Maybe you're thinking of one of those?\n\n**User:**\nI see. Thanks for clarifying that. So, how does the OPTION_PBAAS option restrict a chain to a single currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_PBAAS option doesn't actually restrict a chain to a single currency. It's used to define a PBaaS chain. If you want to restrict a PBaaS chain or gateway to a single currency, you would use the OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY option, not the OPTION_PBAAS option.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. One more question. What is the default converter for a PBaaS gateway when the OPTION_GATEWAY option is set?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_GATEWAY option doesn't specify a default converter for a PBaaS gateway. If you want to specify a default converter for a specific PBaaS gateway, you would use the OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER option.",
