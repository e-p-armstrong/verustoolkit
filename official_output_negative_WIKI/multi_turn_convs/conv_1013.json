    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand how the Verus protocol works, and I had a question about the scalability of k. What's the maximum number of blockchains that can operate simultaneously on k?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is no maximum number of blockchains that can operate simultaneously on k. k is fractal, which means it can support an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. This allows for a high degree of scalability and flexibility in the Verus ecosystem. Do you have any other questions about k or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I also had a question about ID management. How do you unlock an ID that has been revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can't unlock an ID that has been revoked. Revoking an identity clears its locked status, regardless of any previously set time delay or unlock height. Once an ID is revoked, it cannot be unlocked. This is a security feature to ensure that revoked IDs remain revoked and cannot be used again. Do you have any other questions about ID management or VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the Verus API, and I had a question about the `getcurrencyconverters` API. Can you use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have at least 500 VRSC in reserve?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, not 500 VRSC. Additionally, the currencies must also meet the conditions of having a reserve ratio greater than 10% and having all listed currencies as reserves. So, you can use the API to get a list of currencies that meet these conditions, but not with a reserve of 500 VRSC. Do you have any other questions about the Verus API or currency management?",
