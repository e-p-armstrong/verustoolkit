    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in using Verus, but I want to know more about the software itself. Is the software provided with a warranty or guarantee of any kind?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. You should understand that you're using the software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Are the authors or copyright holders of the software liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the authors or copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. The software is provided without any warranty or liability. You're responsible for using the software responsibly and understanding its limitations.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that some antivirus software flags Verus as malware. Do Avast and Kaspersky always detect the software as malware?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which are warnings that you are installing mining software, not a detection of malware. These warnings are meant to inform users that the software may be installed by a third party to exploit their PC. Verus is not malware, and these warnings are simply cautionary measures taken by antivirus software.",
