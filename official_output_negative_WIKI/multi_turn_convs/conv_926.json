    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about using VerusIDs with other blockchains, but I've heard they're not compatible. Can you explain why Verus IDs are not compatible with other blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a common misconception! Verus IDs are not entirely incompatible with other blockchains. While they are a unique and innovative technology, they can still be used in conjunction with other blockchains. In fact, Verus IDs can be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs. This means that while you can use Verus IDs with other blockchains, the advanced features and security benefits of Verus IDs are only fully available within the Verus ecosystem.\n\nSo, while there are some limitations to using Verus IDs with other blockchains, it's not a hard \"no\" - there are still ways to leverage the power of Verus IDs in a multi-blockchain environment.",

            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerus IDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.",
