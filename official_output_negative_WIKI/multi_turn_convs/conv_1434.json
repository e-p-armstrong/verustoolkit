    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to send some coins from a transparent address to a zaddr using the `verus z_sendmany` command. Is this possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, that's not how the `verus z_sendmany` command works. The `verus z_sendmany` command is used to send coins from a zaddr to a transparent address, not the other way around. It allows you to send a specified amount of Verus to a given transparent address, ID address, or ID-name. If you're trying to send coins from a transparent address to a zaddr, you'll need to use a different approach. Would you like some help with that?",

The following command sends 10 Verus to a given transparent address, ID address or ID-name.\nExample: `verus z_sendmany zcZpfuzzJqmNJ3fUJekvbnyuxuJe9eAURAHrMCvN2Nr7VuWjakb1LEw6j2etPcCnr45BRot7MaMbipuS5da162BfuUkFGxx '[{\"amount\":10,\"address\":\"Verus Coin Foundation@\"}]'`\n\nNote: revision date 2020-02-12.",
