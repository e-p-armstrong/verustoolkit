    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about VerusIDs. How do you unlock a locked VerusID if you've forgotten the unlock delay?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou don't need to remember the unlock delay to unlock a locked VerusID. If a user wants to unlock an ID, they can simply revoke and recover the ID, which will allow them to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking the ID. This ensures a virtually theft-proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. So, you don't have to worry about remembering the unlock delay, you can just revoke and recover the ID to unlock it.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! Another question I had is, are VerusIDs only compatible with Verus coins?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not only compatible with Verus coins. They can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. So, you can use VerusIDs with a variety of currencies, not just Verus coins. This makes them a very versatile and useful tool for managing your digital assets.",
