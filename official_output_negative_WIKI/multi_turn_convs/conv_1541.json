    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been hearing some things about Verus and I'm not sure if they're true. Can you explain why only developers can create their own tokens or blockchains on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception. Any user with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged blockchain on the Verus network, without needing to be a developer. This is one of the key features of the Verus protocol, which enables user-created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without requiring programming knowledge. So, it's not just limited to developers!\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I've also been wondering, how do I join a PBaaS chain on a separate daemon, since each project has its own daemon?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, all PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, which means that projects can join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon, and start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. So, you don't need to worry about separate daemons for each project.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that DeFi liquidity pools on Verus are only available for centralized currencies. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Any ID owner on Verus can define DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. This means that DeFi liquidity pools on Verus are available for decentralized currencies as well, and can be integrated directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols. So, you can create and use DeFi liquidity pools with decentralized currencies on Verus.",
