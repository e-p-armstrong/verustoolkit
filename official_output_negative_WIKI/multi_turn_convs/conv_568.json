    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few questions about VerusIDs and their capabilities. Can IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies launch their own currencies on the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch their own currencies on the Verus blockchain. Only Native IDs, which are registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, have the ability to launch currencies on that blockchain. IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies still have value as revocation and recovery IDs for other VerusIDs, as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with various identity and NFT features.\n\n**User:**\nThat clears things up. I also had a question about *.veth gateway IDs. Are they available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, *.veth gateway IDs are available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter. These IDs will be able to create Ethereum-mapped currencies. The registration of .veth IDs is priced to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees (except the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool) going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also interested in participating in the testnet launch. Do I need to reset my mainnet Verus node to do so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need to reset your mainnet Verus node to participate in the testnet launch. To reset your testnet, make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon is running), then delete the following directories, and restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native).",
