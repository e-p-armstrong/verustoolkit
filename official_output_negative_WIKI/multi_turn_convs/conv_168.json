    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having a bit of trouble with some commands. Can you help me out? I'm trying to use the `refundfailedlaunch` command to send funds to a specific address. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's a misunderstanding. The `refundfailedlaunch` command is not used to send funds to a specific address. It's actually used to refund any funds sent to a chain if they are eligible for refund. This command attempts to refund all transactions for all contributors to the specified chain. It's not meant for sending funds to a specific address. Is there something else I can help you with?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I've also been having trouble with the `sendcurrency` command. What happens if I don't specify a \"fromaddress\" when using this command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't specify a \"fromaddress\" when using the `sendcurrency` command, funds may come from any source set of UTXOs controlled by the wallet. The command will automatically source funds from the current wallet. So, you don't necessarily need to specify a \"fromaddress\" for this command to work.\n\n**User:**\nAlright, got it. And one more question. Can I use the `sendcurrency` command to refund funds sent to a chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `sendcurrency` command is not used to refund funds sent to a chain. It's used to send one or many Verus outputs to one or many addresses on the same or another chain. If you need to refund funds sent to a chain, you should use the `refundfailedlaunch` command instead.",
