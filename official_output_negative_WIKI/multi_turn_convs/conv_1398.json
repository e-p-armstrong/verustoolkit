    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST coins from a single address to a single recipient, and I was wondering if I could also give the recipient a 10% bonus on top of the original amount. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that! Unfortunately, the `sendcurrency` API does not have a built-in feature to give a bonus to the recipient. You can only send a specified amount of VRSCTEST coins from a single address to a single recipient using the `sendcurrency` API. For example, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis will send 10 VRSCTEST coins from the address \"bob@\" to the address \"alice@\". If you want to give a bonus, you would need to calculate the bonus amount separately and send it in a separate transaction.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, thank you! By the way, I've been playing around with the testnet coins/currencies on VRSCTEST. Are they valuable and permanent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, they are not. All testnet coins/currencies on VRSCTEST have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. The testnet is meant for testing and development purposes only, so anything you do on it is not meant to be permanent. You can experiment with different scenarios, test your code, and try out new features without worrying about losing real assets. Just keep in mind that everything on the testnet can be wiped out at any time.",
