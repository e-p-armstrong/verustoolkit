    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have some more questions about VerusIDs, specifically about currencies on the Verus blockchain. How can IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies create their own currencies on the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch their own currencies on the Verus blockchain. Only Native IDs, which are registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, have this capability. IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies still have value as revocation and recovery IDs, and can be used for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with various identity and NFT features. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs and currencies?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering about *.veth gateway IDs. Are they available for registration on the Verus blockchain for free?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, *.veth gateway IDs are not available for registration on the Verus blockchain for free. The registration of .veth IDs is priced at 100 USD worth of ETH to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity. This fee, except for the 1 VRSC import fee, goes into the bridge converter liquidity basket. So, there is a cost involved in registering a .veth gateway ID.\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the testnet and mainnet, and I was wondering, can I reset my mainnet by deleting the testnet directories?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you should not delete mainnet directories to reset your mainnet. The instructions for resetting the testnet by deleting specific directories and restarting the testnet daemon (or relaunching Verus Desktop) are only applicable to the testnet, not the mainnet. Be careful not to mix up your testnet and mainnet configurations, as they are separate and distinct. If you need help with resetting your testnet or mainnet, I'd be happy to guide you through the process.",
