    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with the \"sendcurrency\" API and I noticed the \"burn\" parameter. Can you tell me how it increases the on-chain price for all holders of a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the \"burn\" parameter in the \"sendcurrency\" API doesn't directly increase the on-chain price for all holders of a currency. What it does is decrease the supply of a currency. When \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent (which must be a token or fractional currency) is officially removed from that currency's supply. This can lead to an increase in the on-chain price for all holders of a fractional currency, but that's an indirect effect, not a direct result of the \"burn\" parameter.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for clarifying that. I've also been wondering about how currency conversions work. I've noticed that the conversion rate between currencies always seems to favor the early converters in a group of transactions. Can you explain why that is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misunderstanding. The conversion rate between currencies is always the same for all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is no spread between the conversion to and from a currency, and all transactions in an aggregation of import blocks are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions, with all converters getting the same price in each direction. So, there's no advantage to being an \"early converter\" in terms of getting a better rate.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. One more question: I've been reading about the changes in version v0.7.1-3, and I noticed that the reserve ratio of all currencies is automatically reduced. How does the currency controller profit from this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe currency controller doesn't profit from the automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. The automatic reductions enable price-neutral minting by the currency controller, which means that the controller can mint new currency without affecting the price. This is a feature that allows for more flexible and controlled currency management, but it doesn't provide a direct profit to the controller.",

            "The \"burn\" parameter in the \"sendcurrency\" API actually decreases the supply of a currency, not increases the on-chain price for all holders.
