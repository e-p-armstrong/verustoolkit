    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got some questions about the software before I start using it. What kind of warranty does the software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software comes with no warranty of any kind, express or implied. It is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty. This means that you use the software at your own risk, and we don't guarantee that it will work as intended or meet your expectations.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. If I use this software, am I protected from any claims or damages that may arise?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you are not protected from any claims or damages that may arise. The authors or copyright holders shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. You use the software at your own risk, and you're responsible for any consequences that may arise from its use.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that some antivirus software flags the software as a virus. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAvast and Kaspersky do not flag the software as a virus. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is mining software and may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not actually a virus. It's just a precautionary measure taken by the antivirus software to protect you from potential threats.",
