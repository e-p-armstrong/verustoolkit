    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have a few questions about UTXOs and merging. When setting the transparent limit parameter to zero, what is the maximum number of UTXOs that can be selected for merging?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! When the transparent limit parameter is set to zero, the number of UTXOs selected for merging is not fixed and can vary. Before Overwinter is active, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option determines the number of UTXOs. After Overwinter has activated, the number of UTXOs is limited based on the size of the transaction, with a maximum transaction size constraint of 100000 bytes before Sapling and 2000000 bytes once Sapling activates.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering, is it true that if the transparent limit parameter is set to a non-zero value, there is no limit to the number of UTXOs that can be selected for merging?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, that's not correct. Even if the transparent limit parameter is set to a non-zero value, there is still a limit to the number of UTXOs that can be selected for merging due to the consensus rule defining a maximum transaction size. The maximum transaction size is 100000 bytes before Sapling and 2000000 bytes once Sapling activates.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification. One more question: Does the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option have any effect on the number of UTXOs selected for merging after Overwinter has activated?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it doesn't. After Overwinter has activated, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option is ignored, and the number of UTXOs selected for merging is limited based on the size of the transaction, with a maximum transaction size constraint of 2000000 bytes once Sapling activates.",
