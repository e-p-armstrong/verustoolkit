    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about Verus and I'm not sure what to expect. Is the Verus network still in development, with many features missing?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus network, including public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols, are considered feature complete for the coming mainnet PBaaS upgrade. The focus has shifted to protocol hardening and enabling usage, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure. So, you can expect a pretty solid foundation to work with.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I was also wondering, is there no way to visualize the cross-chain network connections in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there is a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer available in Verus Desktop, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on-chain and cross-chain. This visualizer can be accessed by clicking on \"Visualize Network\" on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop. It's a great way to get a sense of how the different chains are connected.\n\n**User:**\nI've been interested in PBaaS capabilities, are they still in development and not available on the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, all PBaaS capabilities, including those for application development, are available now on the new Verus testnet. The goal is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge in the near future, and developers can start exploring the Verus testnet to get a head start on using Verus's transformative technologies. So, you can start playing around with PBaaS on the testnet right away!",
