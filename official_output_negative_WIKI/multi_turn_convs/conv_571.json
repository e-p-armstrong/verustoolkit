    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm about to start using this software, but I have some concerns about its reliability and potential risks. Is this software guaranteed to be free of bugs and damage, and is the author responsible for any damages caused by its use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI completely understand your concerns! Unfortunately, the software is explicitly labeled as \"experimental and unfinished\" and is used at the user's own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. It's essential to keep this in mind when deciding to use the software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I understand that. Say I want to modify and redistribute this software. Can I do that without including the original copyright notice and permission notice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot modify and redistribute the software without including the original copyright notice and permission notice. The permission notice explicitly states that the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. You must adhere to these terms if you plan to modify or redistribute the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. One last question - are there no links provided to check the software for viruses or malware?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, yes, there are links provided to check the software for viruses or malware on VirusTotal, a website that analyzes files for malware and viruses. The links are provided for MacOS, Linux-AMD64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows. You can use these links to scan the software before installing it, which is always a good practice when downloading software from the internet.",
