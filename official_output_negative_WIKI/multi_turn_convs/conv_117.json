    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to use the `getbestproofroot` method, but I'm having some trouble. How do I use it without providing the `proofroots` array?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to help! Unfortunately, it's not possible to use the `getbestproofroot` method without providing the `proofroots` array. It's a required parameter, and the method won't work without it. You need to provide a JSON object with the `proofroots` array, which contains the necessary information about the proof roots, such as version, type, system ID, height, state root, block hash, and power. Can I help you with anything else?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But I have another question. Can I use the `getbestproofroot` method to get the latest invalid proof root of a chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getbestproofroot` method actually returns the latest valid proof root of a chain, not the latest invalid one. It provides information about the best proof root that is not yet confirmed, as well as the confirmed index and currency states. If you're looking for invalid proof roots, you might need to use a different method or approach. Do you have any other questions about `getbestproofroot` or Verus in general?",
