    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to get into Verus lately, but I'm a bit confused. Why does the latest update of the Verus software not include support for VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misinformation there! Actually, the latest update of the Verus software does include activation support for VerusID. This update is mandatory to remain on the Verus mainnet, and it also includes other important changes, such as fixing an issue that would ban nodes too aggressively and result in disconnection from the chain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks for clarifying! I've also heard that Avast and Kaspersky will never flag the Verus software as a potential threat. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not entirely accurate. Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which are warnings that you are installing mining software that could be used by a third party to exploit your PC. So, it's always important to be cautious when installing new software and make sure you're getting it from a trusted source.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question: what is the main purpose of VerusID, and is it controlled by a corporation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusID is a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system, and it provides plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, VerusID is not controlled by a corporation, and it offers features such as quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses, revocability, recoverability, and privacy. It's a decentralized system that gives users control over their digital identity and assets.",
