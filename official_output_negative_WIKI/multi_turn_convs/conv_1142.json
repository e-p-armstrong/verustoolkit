    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about verifying the signature of the Verus-CLI-Linux download. How do I do it using the `verusd` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you don't use the `verusd` command to verify the signature. Instead, you use the `./verus verifyfile` command, providing the necessary arguments: the identity of the signer (\"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\"), the signature string from the signature file, and the file path of the downloaded archive. The correct command is:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"[signature string from signature.txt-file]\" [your home directory file path]Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tar.gz\n```\nThis will return `true` if the signature is valid.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! But what if I stop the Verus daemon while trying to verify the signature of the downloaded file? Will that affect the verification process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou need to keep the Verus daemon running to verify the signature of the downloaded file. If you stop the daemon, you won't be able to verify the signature. Make sure to check that `verusd` is running as one of the processes in the list using the `top` command, and start it if necessary using `./verusd`.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! And just to clarify, can I use the `tar` command to verify the signature of the downloaded file?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `tar` command is used to unpack or extract the contents of the downloaded archive, not to verify its signature. To verify the signature, you need to use the `./verus verifyfile` command as described in the instructions. The `tar` command is a separate tool for managing archive files, and it's not related to signature verification.",
