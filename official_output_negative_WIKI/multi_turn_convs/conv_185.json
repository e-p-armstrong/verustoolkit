    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there, I was playing around with the `getnettotals` command and I was wondering, what does it return besides total bytes received and total bytes sent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getnettotals` command actually returns three values: `totalbytesrecv`, `totalbytessent`, and `timemillis`. `timemillis` represents the total CPU time. So, in addition to the received and sent bytes, you also get a measure of the total CPU time used.",
