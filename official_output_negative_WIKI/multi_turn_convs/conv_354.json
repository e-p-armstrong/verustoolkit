    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the different fields in a transaction. Can you help me out? Specifically, what does the \"fee\" field in a transaction represent, and when is it available?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"fee\" field in a transaction represents the amount of the fee in VRSC, but it's not always available. It's only available for the 'send' category of transactions, and it's a negative value. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! I was also wondering about the \"confirmations\" field. I thought it was only available for the 'move' category of transactions. Am I correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. The \"confirmations\" field is actually available for both the 'send' and 'receive' categories of transactions, not just the 'move' category.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. And what about the \"blockhash\" field? Is it available for all types of transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the \"blockhash\" field is only available for the 'send' and 'receive' categories of transactions, not for all types of transactions.\n\n**User:**\nAnd finally, is the \"timereceived\" field always available for all transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the \"timereceived\" field is only available for the 'send' and 'receive' categories of transactions, not for all transactions.",
