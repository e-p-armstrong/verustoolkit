    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been using Verus and I'm really impressed. But I was wondering, does this software come with a warranty that covers any kind of damage?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! Unfortunately, the answer is no. The software does not come with a warranty that covers any kind of damage. In fact, the software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, and the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks for the transparency. Another question I had is, is this software completely finished and stable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAnother great question! Unfortunately, the answer is no again. The software is not completely finished and stable. It is experimental and unfinished, and may have bugs or other issues. So, please use it at your own risk! We're constantly working to improve it, but it's still a work in progress.",
