    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating my own currency, and I was wondering if I could create a currency with any name I want, without needing an ID of the same name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't do that. To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nSo, if I have an ID with a certain name, can anyone else create a currency with the same name if they have an ID with that name as well?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not possible. Only the controller of the ID with the same name can create a currency with that name. And they can only do so once.\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I have multiple IDs with the same name? Can I create multiple currencies with the same name then?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't. Even if you have multiple IDs with the same name, each ID can only be used to create a currency with that name once.",
