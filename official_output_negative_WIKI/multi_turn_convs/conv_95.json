    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been using Verus for a while now, but I've encountered some issues with antivirus software. Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky consider the Verus software to be a virus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky do not consider the Verus software to be a virus. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potential Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is mining software and may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not actually a virus.\n\n**User:**\nThat's weird. I've also had some issues with verifying the authenticity of Verus downloads. How do I verify the authenticity of a Verus download if there is no signature or checksum provided?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, a txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is included with each download. You can use this information to verify the authenticity of the download. Specifically, you can extract the downloaded archive, verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\n**User:**\nAnother question, I've been running an older version of the CLI and I just got a notification to upgrade to v0.7.2-8. Can I skip the mandatory CLI upgrade to v0.7.2-8 if I'm already running a previous version of the CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the update to v0.7.2-8 is considered mandatory, and all node operators should update as soon as possible. This release includes critical updates and important bug fixes, such as fixed fetch-bootstrap temp file cleanup on Windows and fixed fetch-bootstrap checksum verification on MacOS. It's important to update to ensure the security and stability of your node.",
