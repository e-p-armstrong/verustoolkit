    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in the security of VerusIDs. How do VerusIDs prevent staking from happening when an identity is locked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, VerusIDs enable staking to happen even when an identity is locked. This is because Verus Vault allows identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. This feature ensures that your funds are safe while still earning rewards. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know. I've also been wondering, can VerusIDs be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses only for one specific currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network, not just one specific currency. This means you can use your VerusID to receive and manage multiple currencies across different blockchains, making it a very versatile and convenient tool.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really powerful. I've been thinking about creating my own token or blockchain, but I'm not a programmer. Do users need to have programming knowledge to create their own tokens or blockchains using VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, users do not need programming knowledge to create their own tokens or blockchains using VerusIDs. The VerusID protocol allows any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain without needing to know how to program. This democratizes the creation of tokens and blockchains, making it accessible to everyone.\n\n**User:**\nThat's amazing. One last question: Are DeFi capabilities only available on the main Verus chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, DeFi capabilities are available on all PBaaS chains in the Verus network, not just the main Verus chain. Additionally, any ID owner can define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies. This means you can create and manage your own DeFi instruments across multiple chains, giving you a lot of flexibility and control.",
