    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new currency and I'm not sure what I'm doing. Can you help me out? What is the purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to 1 when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, it's not setting `proofprotocol` to 1, but rather setting it to 2. Setting `proofprotocol` to 2 means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. This is demonstrated in the example where `proofprotocol` is set to 2, allowing the controller to mint new coins with a command like `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'`.\n\n**User:**\nSo, if I set `proofprotocol` to 2, can anyone mint new coins in my currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not anyone can mint new coins. Only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins when `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. This is a specific permission granted to the controller, not a general ability for anyone to mint new coins.",
