    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the testnet a bit better. Are testnet coins/currencies valuable and permanent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset, as explicitly stated in the warning. So, don't get too attached to them!\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've been playing around with the `sendcurrency` API, and I'm wondering if I can use it to send and convert funds without specifying the currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `sendcurrency` API requires specifying the currency, as shown in the examples. For instance, when sending VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, you need to specify the currency as \"vrsctest\". Similarly, when converting VRSCTEST to another currency, you need to specify the target currency, such as \"VRSC-BTC\" or \"BTC\". You can't leave the currency field blank or undefined. Does that clarify things for you?",
