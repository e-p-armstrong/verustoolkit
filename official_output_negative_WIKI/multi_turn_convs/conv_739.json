    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI heard about the Verus ID and VerusHash 2.1 Network Upgrade release candidate. Can you tell me what's the purpose of this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe release candidate is not intended for official use on the mainnet, but rather for testing on both the VRSCTEST testnet and VRSC mainnet. It's essential to upgrade to an official release before the network activation, which is expected to happen at block 800200, around December 15th. Would you like to know more about the upgrade process?\n\n**User:**\nI've been wondering, are Verus IDs a centralized digital identity system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus IDs are a fully decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity system. They provide built-in privacy through the integration of zk-SNARKs and offer a revolutionary improvement to blockchain address security. VerusIDs are designed to give users complete control over their digital identity and assets.\n\n**User:**\nI've had some issues with my antivirus software. Do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag the Verus software as malicious?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAvast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which are warnings that you are installing mining software. This is not because the software is malicious, but rather because it may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC for mining purposes. The Verus software is safe to use, and these warnings are just a precautionary measure by the antivirus software.",
