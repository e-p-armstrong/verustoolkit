    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been following some updates about Verus and I'm a bit confused. I heard that the developers decided to remove Verus IDs from the upcoming network upgrade. Can you tell me why that is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not true. Verus IDs are actually a key part of the upcoming network upgrade, not something that is being removed. In fact, this upgrade enables this revolutionary, new decentralized identity technology, which is expected to disrupt today's centralized systems with the most secure, quantum-ready, fully decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity system in the world. So, there's no need to worry, Verus IDs are still an important part of the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. I was also getting some warnings from my antivirus software, Avast and Kaspersky, saying that the Verus software is a virus. What's going on with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe warnings from Avast and Kaspersky are not actually flagging the Verus software as a virus. Instead, they are flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program), which is a warning that the software is mining software that could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a common warning for many cryptocurrency-related software, and it's just a precautionary measure. The Verus software is safe and secure, and you don't need to worry about it being a virus.",
