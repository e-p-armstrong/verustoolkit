    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into DeFi on Verus and I'm curious about how AMM conversions work. Since they aren't verified by mining and staking, how do they actually work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, DeFi AMM conversions are, in fact, verified via mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol. This means that all conversions in a single liquidity basket are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block, ensuring that all participants get the same price in all directions of conversion. The minimum conversion fee is 0.025%, and the maximum is 0.05%.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering about the currencies on this blockchain. Are they limited to this network, or can they be sent to other networks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrencies on this blockchain can be sent to other multi-currency capable networks, including other independent PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s. This allows for seamless interaction and transfer of value between different networks.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question I have is about launching new currencies on this blockchain. I've heard that there's only one way to do it, and I'm curious about how the fundraising options work.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there are multiple ways to launch a new currency on this blockchain, and each of these fundraising options creates a currency that is not 100% backed, with a price that responds to market forces. These options include fundraising, endowing launch grants or pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, and launching a new blockchain, which creates new native currency for operating the proof of stake of the blockchain. So, there are a few different paths you can take, depending on your goals and needs.",
