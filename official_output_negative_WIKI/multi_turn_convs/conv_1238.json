    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to set up my Verus Vault, and I'm not sure about something. How do I enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities without having a primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think I see where the confusion is. You can't enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities without having one primary identity, and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This is a necessary step to take advantage of the advanced security features offered by Verus Vault.\n\n**User:**\nI see. Okay, that makes sense. I was also wondering, does Verus Vault only provide security for funds, but not for IDs and NFTs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault provides security not only for funds but also for IDs and NFTs. Additionally, it offers time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. So, you can rest assured that your digital assets are well-protected.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! One more question, I'm not super tech-savvy, but I'd like to create some new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. Is it possible to do this on the Verus mainnet without any programming knowledge?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhile it's not possible to do this on the Verus mainnet without programming knowledge, you can actually do this on the Verus testnet without any programming knowledge. You can use the easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. So, don't let your lack of programming knowledge hold you back!",

            "You can't. Enabling revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities actually requires you to have one primary identity, and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This is a necessary step to take advantage of the advanced security features offered by Verus Vault.",

At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs.
