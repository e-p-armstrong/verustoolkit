    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a tokenized ID control, but I'm not sure if it's possible to set a max supply of more than 1 satoshi. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a tokenized ID control with a max supply of more than 1 satoshi. The important thing is to set the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN` flags in the currency definition. This will allow you to customize the token's properties, including the max supply, to your needs. Would you like more information on how to set up the currency definition or any other aspects of tokenized ID control?",
