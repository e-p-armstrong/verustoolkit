    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I had a few questions about Verus and its options. I was looking into OPTION_ID_STAKING and I was wondering, is it an option that allows IDs to stake based on their value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, actually, OPTION_ID_STAKING is an option that allows all IDs on the chain to stake equally, rather than staking based on their value. So, it's more of a flat staking system, where every ID has an equal say, rather than a system where IDs with more value have more influence.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was also looking into OPTION_TOKEN and I was wondering, what is the effect of setting it to 0 when defining a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf OPTION_TOKEN is set to 32, then the currency is a token, not a native currency. It can be inferred that if OPTION_TOKEN is not set to 32, then the currency is a native currency. So, setting it to 0 would mean that the currency is a native currency, rather than a token. Does that clarify things for you?",
