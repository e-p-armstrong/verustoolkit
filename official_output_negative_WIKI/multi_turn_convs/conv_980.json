    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few questions about the recent bridge release update. How do I recover my testnet funds after the bridge release reset?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDon't worry, there was no reset, and no testnet funds were lost. The update process has been successful so far, and we're on track to move forward with the mainnet release. Your testnet funds are still safe and accessible.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great news! I've been updating my Verus client daily to keep testing the bridge release. Do I need to continue doing that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need to update your Verus client daily. This update is likely the last one for this round of testnet, and you won't need to update again until close to the mainnet release. You can take a break from daily updates!\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if I miss the fork for this version and my Verus client is no longer in sync with the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you miss the fork, you can get back on the correct chain by stopping Verus, deleting everything except your `wallet.dat` file in your data directory, and then restarting Verus. The data directory paths for different operating systems are: [insert paths here]. Just follow those steps, and you'll be back in sync with the testnet.",

            "The good news is that throughout the whole process of this first bridge release on testnet, we've been able to update through the issues we've seen without a reset and have not lost a single satoshi of test funds (which is not to say it is fully hardened quite yet). At this point, we hope and believe that this is the last update in this round of testnet, which will allow us to get back to focusing on the mainnet release and not asking those testing to update until we are very close to a mainnet release.Once more, we will ask that you shut down the old version now, and we will restart the notarizations and transaction flow between Ethereum and Verus at 5 AM UTC time.Thank you to everyone who helped with all the testing and exposing of issues that enabled us to make maybe even inconveniently quick progress.If you miss the fork for this version at the above time you can get back on the correct chain by stopping Verus and deleting deleting everything other than your wallet.dat file in your data directory at:\n- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest`## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n  ```",
