    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been wondering, does Verus support public blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, Verus supports both private, internal blockchains and public blockchains. It allows for easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. This makes it really flexible and useful for a wide range of use cases. Do you have any other questions about Verus and blockchains?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I've been playing around with the Verus API and I'm a bit confused about the `getcurrencyconverters` API. What's the purpose of this API if it only returns currencies that have exactly 1000 VRSC in reserve and a 10% VRSC reserve ratio?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misunderstanding! The `getcurrencyconverters` API actually returns all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It's not limited to currencies with exactly 1000 VRSC in reserve and a 10% VRSC reserve ratio. This API is useful for getting a list of currencies that can be used for conversions, and the reserve requirements are there to ensure that the currencies are stable and reliable for conversions. Does that clarify things?",
