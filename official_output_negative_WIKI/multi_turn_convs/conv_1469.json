    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about the `getcurrencyconverters` API. How do I use it to retrieve all currencies that have at least 500 VRSC in reserve?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, not 500 VRSC. Additionally, it also filters currencies that have a reserve ratio greater than 10% VRSC and have all listed currencies as reserves. So, if you use this API, you'll get a list of currencies that meet these specific conditions. Let me know if you have any other questions about the `getcurrencyconverters` API or Verus in general!",
