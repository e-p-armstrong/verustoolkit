    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there, I'm trying to understand some of the settings in a currency definition. Specifically, I'm looking at the `proofprotocol` setting. What does it mean when `proofprotocol` is set to 1 in a currency definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's actually an invalid setting. In a currency definition, `proofprotocol` is typically set to 2, which means PROOF_CHAINID, allowing the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Setting it to 1 is not a valid option.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. So, if `proofprotocol` is set to 2, can anyone mint new coins in that currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins when `proofprotocol` is set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID). It's a restrictive setting that ensures only the designated authority can create new coins.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. So, is there a way to define a currency with a `proofprotocol` that allows anyone to mint new coins?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, there isn't. The `proofprotocol` setting is designed to provide some level of control and security, and setting it to 2 restricts minting to the controller of the chain ID. There isn't a setting that would allow just anyone to mint new coins.",
