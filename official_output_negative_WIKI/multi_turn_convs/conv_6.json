    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a question about revoking identities in Verus. What happens when you revoke an identity that has a locked status and a time delay or unlock height set?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you revoke an identity, its locked status is cleared, regardless of the time delay or unlock height. So, the revocation process will not be affected by the lock. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Another question I had about locked identities is, can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. This is a security feature to prevent unintended revocations. It's an added layer of protection to ensure that identities are not revoked accidentally or maliciously.",
