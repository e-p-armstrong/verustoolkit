    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about VerusIDs. Can you explain why it's not possible to buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some misinformation there. It is possible to buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain. The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace allows for direct, decentralized transactions between buyers and sellers, without the need for intermediaries. You can post your offer or sale on the blockchain for others to see, and execute transactions directly, peer-to-peer. Would you like more information on how to use the marketplace?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I was told that I need to use an intermediary to execute transactions on the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. Can you explain how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been a misunderstanding. You don't need to use an intermediary to execute transactions on the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. In fact, the marketplace is designed to facilitate direct, decentralized transactions between buyers and sellers, without the need for intermediaries. You can execute transactions directly, peer-to-peer, and still have the option to share proceeds with value-added agents or marketing organizations if you choose to do so. You can simply post your offer or sale on the blockchain and complete the transaction directly with the other party.\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with Verus Vault, and I was wondering what happens if I lock my VerusID with Verus Vault and then try to spend funds from that identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you lock your VerusID with Verus Vault, you will not be able to spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. However, you can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network to earn rewards. So, while you won't be able to spend the funds, you can still use them to earn rewards through staking.",
