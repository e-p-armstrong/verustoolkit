    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `fromaddresses` argument to send funds from both Sprout and Sapling addresses simultaneously. Is this possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm afraid not. The documentation explicitly states that it's not possible to send funds from both Sprout and Sapling addresses simultaneously using the `fromaddresses` argument. If you try to use a special string like \"ANY_SPROUT\" and \"ANY_SAPLING\" together, it will cause an error.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a bummer. Moving on, what's the default fee amount attached to a transaction if I don't specify the `fee` argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's an easy one! The default fee amount attached to a transaction if you don't specify the `fee` argument is 0.0001.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks! I was also wondering if I can set the `transparent_limit` argument to a negative value to merge an unlimited number of UTXOs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't do that. The documentation states that setting `transparent_limit` to 0 will use the node option `-mempooltxinputlimit` (before Overwinter) or merge as many UTXOs as will fit in the transaction (after Overwinter). But you can't set it to a negative value to merge an unlimited number of UTXOs.",
