    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have some questions about the software. What kind of warranty does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that there is no warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. So, basically, you're using the software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. If I encounter any issues with the software, can I hold the authors or copyright holders liable for damages or other liability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, according to the disclaimer, the authors or copyright holders shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. You're essentially using the software at your own risk, and you can't hold anyone responsible if something goes wrong.\n\n**User:**\nI've been getting some warnings from my antivirus software, Avast and Kaspersky. Are they indicating that the software is a virus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the warnings from Avast and Kaspersky are not indicating that the software is a virus. They are flagging the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which means that the software may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC for mining purposes. These warnings are false positives, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about them. Don't worry, the software is safe to use!",
