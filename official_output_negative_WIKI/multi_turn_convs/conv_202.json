    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to define a new currency and I'm a bit unclear about the `proofprotocol` parameter. When defining a new currency, is it recommended to set the `proofprotocol` to 1, which is PROOF_WORK?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, it's not recommended to set the `proofprotocol` to 1, which is PROOF_WORK, when defining a new currency. In the given example, `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.\n\n**User:**\nSo, what does that mean exactly? Can anyone mint new coins in a currency with `proofprotocol` set to 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not anyone can mint new coins in a currency with `proofprotocol` set to 2. Only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins when `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID.",
