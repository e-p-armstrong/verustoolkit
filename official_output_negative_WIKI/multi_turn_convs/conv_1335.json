    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about Verus Desktop on a Mac. What is the default location for the Verus CLI binaries in a Verus Desktop installation on a Mac?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the default location for Verus CLI binaries on a Mac for Verus Desktop installation is not specified. However, I can give you some information that might be helpful. On Windows, the Verus binaries are located at `\\resources\\app\\assets\\bin\\win64\\verusd\\`, and on Linux, they are located at `\\resources\\app\\assets\\bin\\linux64\\verusd`. Maybe you can try searching for the binaries in a similar location on your Mac?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I've got another question. Is there only one block explorer for VerusCoin?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, there are at least two block explorers for VerusCoin. The Main VerusCoin Explorer is at `https://explorer.verus.io` and a VerusCoin Backup Explorer is at `https://explorer.vrsc.0x03.s`. So, if one is down or not working for you, you can always try the other one!",
