    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `verusd` command-line interface, and I'm having some trouble with specifying a custom account. Can you help me out? How do you specify a custom account using the \"fromaccount\" argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can't specify a custom account using the \"fromaccount\" argument. The \"fromaccount\" argument must be set to an empty string \"\" to represent the default account. Passing any other string will result in an error. So, just leave it blank and it should work as expected.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Thanks for the clarification! I've also got a question about sending VRSC. What happens if I don't specify the \"subtractfeefromamount\" argument when sending VRSC?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't specify the \"subtractfeefromamount\" argument when sending VRSC, the sender pays the fee. This is the default behavior when no addresses are specified in the \"subtractfeefromamount\" field. So, just be aware that the sender will be charged the fee if you don't specify anything.",
