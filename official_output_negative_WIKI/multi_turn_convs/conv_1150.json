    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use Verus Desktop on my Mac, but I'm not sure if it's supported. Are all versions of OSX/macOS supported for Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, not all versions of OSX/macOS are supported for Verus Desktop. Currently, only macOS 10.12.x and up are tested and supported. Installing Verus Desktop on OSX 10.11.x or earlier may be possible, but the wallet does not function and never completes the initial sync.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What about the Verus CLI wallet? Can I run it on macOS 10.12.x or higher only?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus CLI wallet should run on lower versions of macOS without problems, not just on macOS 10.12.x or higher. So, you should be good to go with the CLI wallet on your Mac, regardless of the OS version.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the info! I was also wondering, where can I find the VRSC Wallet and Data location on Mac OS?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VRSC Wallet and Data location on Mac OS is `/Users//Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`. So, if you need to access your wallet or data, that's where you'll find it.",
