    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand how fractional basket currencies work in Verus. Can you help me with that? Specifically, what's the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` RPC API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` RPC API is designed for finding the best conversion rates for fractional basket currencies. It enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies, allowing wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies and determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about fractional basket currencies or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I've heard about Verus Vault technology, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. Specifically, does it prevent staking on locked funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault technology does not prevent staking on locked funds. In fact, it allows for advanced time lock capabilities without preventing staking on locked funds, making it possible to implement features like vesting, trusts, and theft-proofing funds while still earning staking rewards. So, you can still earn rewards while keeping your funds safe. Does that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also heard that VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology aren't suitable for estate planning and don't provide protection from lost or stolen private keys. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not true. VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology are actually designed to simplify estate planning and provide protection from lost or stolen private keys. They offer a fully self-sovereign manner of managing funds, identity, and estate planning, with the peace of mind that comes from knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys. So, VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology are a great solution for estate planning and private key protection. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or Verus Vault technology?",
