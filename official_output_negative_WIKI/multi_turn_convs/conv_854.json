    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring VerusIDs and NFTs, and I've noticed that they seem to only be tradable through centralized marketplaces. Is that correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not entirely accurate. Verus IDs and NFTs are not only tradable through centralized marketplaces. In fact, they can be bought and sold on-chain in a completely decentralized way, allowing for direct peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. This means that users can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. You have full control over your digital assets and can trade them freely on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know. I've also been looking into Verus Vault, and I was wondering if it's possible to use it to spend funds from a locked VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it is not possible to spend funds from a locked VerusID when using Verus Vault. When you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. However, you can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network to earn rewards. Verus Vault is designed to provide an additional layer of security and protection for your digital assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. One more question: Are revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities available by default on all Verus IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities are not available by default on all Verus IDs. To enable these features, you need to have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This allows you to have full control over your digital identity and assets, and to customize your experience on the Verus network.",
