    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about the `fundrawtransaction` command. What is its purpose, and how does it modify existing inputs in a transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `fundrawtransaction` command is used to add inputs to a transaction until it has enough value to meet its output value. It does not modify existing inputs, but rather adds new ones. Additionally, it adds one change output to the outputs. Note that any inputs that were previously signed may need to be resigned after adding new inputs and outputs.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been trying to understand the `decodescript` command. Can you explain how to use it to decode a hex string into a script?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `decodescript` command is actually used to decode a hex-encoded script, not to encode one. It takes a hex string as an argument and returns a JSON object with information about the script, such as its ASM, hex-encoded public key, type, required signatures, addresses, and P2SH script address.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification! I've also been trying to figure out how to use the `fundrawtransaction` command to sign a transaction. Can you walk me through that process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `fundrawtransaction` command doesn't sign a transaction. It's used to add inputs to a transaction until it has enough value to meet its output value. To sign a transaction, you would need to use the `signrawtransaction` command, which is a separate command. The `fundrawtransaction` command and `signrawtransaction` command are two distinct commands with different purposes.",
