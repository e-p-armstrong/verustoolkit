    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few more questions about Verus Vault and locked VerusIDs. Can I spend funds from a locked VerusID with Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot spend funds from a locked VerusID with Verus Vault. When you lock a VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Does Verus Vault require multiple identities to be set up to enable its capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, Verus Vault does require multiple identities to be set up to enable its capabilities. Specifically, you need to have one primary identity, and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And what about revoking and recovering a locked VerusID? Can anyone do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked VerusID can only be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. This ensures that only the intended authorities can access and manage the locked identity.",

            "### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",
