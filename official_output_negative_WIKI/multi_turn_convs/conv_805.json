    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating an ID, and I was wondering, when creating an ID, how do the fees get distributed between the referrer and the blockchain developers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe fees don't actually get distributed between the referrer and the blockchain developers. According to the protocol, 20 VRSC each goes to the referrer's ID, the referrer's referrer's ID, and the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID. Additionally, 20 VRSC goes to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined. 100% of all funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain. There is no mention of blockchain developers receiving fees.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. What percentage of the fees goes to the referrers when creating an ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt's not a percentage of the fees that goes to the referrers. Instead, a fixed amount of 20 VRSC goes to each of the referrer's ID, the referrer's referrer's ID, and the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID. The remaining amount goes to the miners or stakers of the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that 50% of the fees go to the referrers and 50% go to the miners. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. The fees are distributed as follows: 20 VRSC each goes to the referrer's ID, the referrer's referrer's ID, and the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID. Additionally, 20 VRSC goes to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined. There is no 50/50 split between referrers and miners.",
