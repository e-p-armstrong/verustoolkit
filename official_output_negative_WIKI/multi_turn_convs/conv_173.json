    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about the `submitmergedblock` command. Can it only submit blocks to PBaaS chains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `submitmergedblock` command is not limited to submitting blocks to PBaaS chains only. It can actually submit blocks to both Verus and PBaaS merge mined chains. So, you've got more flexibility than that! Do you have any other questions about this command or merge mining in general?",
