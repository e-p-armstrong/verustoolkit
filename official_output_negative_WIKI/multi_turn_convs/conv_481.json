    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there, I'm trying to launch a new currency on Verus, but I'm having some trouble. Can you explain why I need to fund my identity with 50 VRSCTEST before launching a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there's a small mistake there. You need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command to initiate a currency launch. Not 50 VRSCTEST. Does that make sense? Do you have any other questions about launching a new currency?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But how do I launch a currency without any preconversion requirements? I thought there was a way to do it without having to convert a bunch of VRSCTEST.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, launching a currency does require some preconversion. You need to preconvert at least 1000 VRSCTEST at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD. There's no way to launch a currency without meeting these preconversion requirements, I'm afraid. Do you have any questions about the preconversion process or how it works?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question: can I create new tokens using a decentralized issuance option after the currency launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSorry to disappoint, but currently, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option, not a decentralized one. There's no decentralized issuance option available for creating new tokens at this time.",
