    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus Vault, but I'm not entirely sure what's required to enable its capabilities. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities, it is necessary to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This configuration allows for the protection and recovery of funds, as well as the creation of time locks for various purposes. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about Verus Vault?\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand. But I have another question. If someone gets access to the primary keys of a locked VerusID, can they just spend or access the funds immediately?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys, must first unlock the ID and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This delay allows for the revocation and recovery authority identities to intervene in case of an unauthorized unlock. So, even if someone gets hold of the primary keys, there's still a layer of protection in place.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really reassuring. One last question: does Verus Vault only provide security for funds, but not for IDs and NFTs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault provides the same security for IDs and NFTs as it does for funds. It offers a comprehensive solution for protecting and recovering all types of assets on the blockchain. So, whether you're dealing with funds, IDs, or NFTs, Verus Vault has got you covered.",
