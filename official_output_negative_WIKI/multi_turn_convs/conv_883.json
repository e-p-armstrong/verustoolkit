    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use Verus and I have a few questions. What if I don't specify a refund address when sending a reserve? Will it default to the sender's address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, if you don't specify a refund address when sending a reserve, it will default to the payment address, not the sender's address. Make sure to specify the refund address if you want it to go somewhere else!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! Another question: Can I convert my VRSCTEST to a native coin on a PBaaS reserve chain without sending it to an address on that chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot convert your VRSCTEST to a native coin on a PBaaS reserve chain without sending it to an address on that chain. You need to use the `tonative` option when sending a reserve to convert it to the native currency of the target chain. Give it a try!\n\n**User:**\nOne more question: Is sending reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain the same as sending native currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, sending reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain is not the same as sending native currency. Reserve currency on a PBaaS chain is equivalent to and convertible between the native VRSCTEST currency, but it may also be sent to and used on PBaaS reserve chains, and it will arrive as reserve currency. If you want to send native currency, you need to use a different command.",
