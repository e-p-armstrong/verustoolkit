    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard that locked VerusIDs don't actually provide any protection against unauthorized access, and can be easily spent or accessed by anyone with the primary keys. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Locked VerusIDs do provide protection against unauthorized access. Anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys, must first unlock and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This is a security feature that prevents unauthorized access. Additionally, the revocation and recovery authority identities can revoke and recover the locked ID, circumventing the lock, which provides an added layer of security. So, locked VerusIDs do offer protection against unauthorized access.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that clears that up. I was also wondering about Verus Vault. What's its purpose, and how does it protect IDs and NFTs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a security feature that provides protection for IDs and NFTs. It provides a decentralized solution to the infamous 5-dollar wrench attack, allowing users to protect and recover their funds, preserving their assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft. It's an important tool for securing your digital assets.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. I've been trying to export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the Verus command-line command, but I was told that I don't need to specify the `exportid` parameter. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. When exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain using the Verus command-line command, the `exportid` parameter is required. The correct command is:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nThe `exportid` parameter is necessary to specify that the ID should be exported to the PBaaS chain. Make sure to include it in your command.",

            "That's not correct. Locked VerusIDs do provide protection against unauthorized access.

            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.
