    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with the `sendcurrency` command. I want to send a specific currency to a specific address, but I don't want to specify the amount. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, it's not possible to use the `sendcurrency` command to send a specific currency to a specific address without specifying the amount. The `amount` parameter is required for the command to work correctly. If you omit it, the command won't work as intended. You'll need to specify the amount you want to send.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I've got another question. What happens when I use the `submitacceptednotarization` command and it's successful? What does it return?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the `submitacceptednotarization` command is successful, it returns a transaction ID (txid) in hexadecimal string format. If the submission is not successful, the command returns NULL. So, if everything goes smoothly, you should get a txid back, which can be useful for tracking the transaction.",
