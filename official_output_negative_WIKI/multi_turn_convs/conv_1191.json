    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about moving coinbases. Can you explain why you need to wait only 10 blocks after receiving the coinbases before being able to move them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some confusion. You need to wait 100 blocks (minutes) after receiving the coinbases before being able to move them, not 10 blocks. This is because the coinbases are mined coins that are not yet staking, and the protocol requires a certain number of blocks to be mined before they can be spent. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that clears things up. Another question: how do I use the `z_sendmany` command without subtracting the 0.0001 VRSC fee from the balance?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't use the `z_sendmany` command without subtracting the 0.0001 VRSC fee from the balance. The command `./verus z_getbalance` is used to get the balance, and then you need to subtract the 0.0001 VRSC fee from the balance when using the `z_sendmany` command. This is because there is a small fee associated with the transaction.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. One more question: can I use a different private address for each step of the procedure?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you need to use the same private address for all steps of the procedure. Using different private addresses for each step wouldn't work. You need to stick with the same one throughout.",
