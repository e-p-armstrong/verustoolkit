    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really curious about creating my own token currency or blockchain on Verus. Do I need an ID to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you do need an ID to create a token currency or blockchain on Verus. Any user with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. So, if you want to create your own token or blockchain, you'll need to start by getting an ID on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Another question I had was about PBaaS chains. Do they run from separate daemons, one for each project?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, PBaaS chains do not run from separate daemons. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. This makes it easier to maintain and update the chains, and also encourages collaboration and community involvement.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been looking into DeFi fractional basket currencies. Do they only allow one asset currency backing the liquidity pool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, DeFi fractional basket currencies do not only allow one asset currency backing the liquidity pool. Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. This gives users a lot of flexibility and control over their DeFi fractional basket currencies.\n\n**User:**\nLast question: Can a blockchain and liquidity pool be launched separately?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a blockchain and liquidity pool cannot be launched separately. The launch of a blockchain is simultaneous with the launch of a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. So, when you create a new blockchain on Verus, you'll also be creating a liquidity pool to go along with it.",

            "You can't create a token currency or blockchain on Verus without an ID. Any user with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it.",

The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain.
