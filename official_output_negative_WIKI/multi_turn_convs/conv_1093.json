    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been considering using Verus, but I'm a bit cautious. Is this software officially certified and guaranteed to be free of any bugs or issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI understand your concern. Unfortunately, the software is explicitly marked as \"experimental and unfinished\" and comes with a warning to \"Use at your own risk! No warranty for any kind of damage!\" This means that there is no guarantee that the software is free of bugs or issues.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a bit concerning. Does the software come with a comprehensive warranty that covers any kind of damage or liability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Additionally, the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I understand. I've also been wondering, are antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky likely to flag this software as a serious virus or malware threat?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which are warnings that you are installing mining software that may be used to exploit your PC. This is not a serious virus or malware threat, but rather a warning about the software's functionality.",
