    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to launch a new currency on Verus, and I was wondering about the requirements. I read that I need to fund a currency with 100 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch. Can you explain why that's necessary?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some misinformation there! You don't need to fund a currency with 100 VRSCTEST, but rather at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch. Additionally, the currency launch requires 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. This is a necessary step to ensure the smooth launch of your new currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat clears things up, thanks! Now, I'm curious about creating new tokens after a currency launches. Is it possible to create new tokens without centralized issuance?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrently, the answer is no, it's not possible to create new tokens after a currency launches without centralized issuance. Right now, centralized issuance is the only way to create new tokens after launch. There isn't a decentralized way to do it, unfortunately.",
