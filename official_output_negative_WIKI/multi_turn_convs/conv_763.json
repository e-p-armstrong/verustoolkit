    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about quantum security. If I upgrade to a quantum secure address, will it only secure new transactions sent to my identity, and leave existing transactions insecure?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Upgrading to a quantum secure address will retroactively secure all existing transactions sent to your identity, not just new ones. This means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity, an upgrade to a quantum secure address will secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address. You don't have to worry about existing transactions being left vulnerable.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know. I've also heard that there's a limit to the number of transactions that can be secured when upgrading to a quantum secure address. Is it true that I can only upgrade if I have less than 100 transactions sent to my identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not a limitation. Upgrading to a quantum secure address will retroactively secure all transactions sent to your identity, regardless of the number of transactions. Whether you have 10, 100, or 1000 transactions sent to your identity, an upgrade to a quantum secure address will secure them all. You don't have to worry about hitting a certain threshold or limit when it comes to securing your transactions.",
