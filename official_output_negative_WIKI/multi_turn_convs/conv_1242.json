    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a new token that can only be converted to with VRSCTEST. I was told to use the command:\n```\ndcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nCan you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that command isn't for creating a new token. It's for parking a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token until it launches. If you want to create a new token, you'll need to use a different command.\n\nFor example, if you want to create a new token called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you would use a command like this:\n```\ndefinecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines a new token with the specified properties. Would you like me to explain more about how to create a new token?\n\n**User:**\nWait, what happens if the token launch fails after I park my conversion using the command:\n```\ndcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nDo I get my VRSCTEST back?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, if the token launch fails, it can be inferred that the conversion would not be successful and you would not receive GOLD or have your VRSCTEST returned. So, it's essential to make sure the token launch is successful before parking your conversion.",
