    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been reading about VerusIDs and I had a question. I thought I read that VerusIDs are limited to a maximum of 100 blockchains in the Verus network. Can you explain how that works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception! VerusIDs are not limited to a maximum of 100 blockchains in the Verus network. In fact, the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n\nSo, you don't have to worry about running out of space or hitting a limit on the number of blockchains you can use with VerusIDs. The Verus network is designed to be highly scalable and flexible, allowing for a wide range of use cases and applications. Does that clear things up?",

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n## Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n## Conversion Q",
