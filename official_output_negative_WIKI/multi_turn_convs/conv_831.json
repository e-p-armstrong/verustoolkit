    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having some trouble connecting to a defined chain without running the local VRSCTEST chain. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you do need to run the local VRSCTEST chain at least once to connect to a defined chain. When you first connect, a local config file is created, and after that, you won't need to run VRSCTEST to connect again. However, you will still need to run VRSCTEST to merge mine. So, go ahead and run VRSCTEST once, and then you should be able to connect to the defined chain without any issues.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Thanks for the help! I've also got a question about reserve ratios. What happens when a currency has a reserve ratio of 0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA currency with a reserve ratio of 0 is not actually possible. The reserve ratio is a percentage that determines how the currency's price changes when converting to or from its reserve. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve, and a currency with a reserve ratio of 0.1 or 10% will rise or fall fairly quickly when converted to or from, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit. So, a reserve ratio of 0 wouldn't make sense in this context. Does that clarify things?",
