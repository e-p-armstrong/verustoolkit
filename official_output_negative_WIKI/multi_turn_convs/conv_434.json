    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to view a transaction in Verus and I'm having some trouble. I think I'm using the wrong command. Can you help me out? I'm trying to use `z_view\u00e9mon` to view a transaction.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think I see the issue! There is no `z_view\u00e9mon` command in Verus. The correct command to view a transaction is actually `z_viewtransaction`. You can use it in the command line, for example: `verus z_viewtransaction \"1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d\"`. Try that instead!\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I have another question. What's the purpose of the `zcrawjoinsplit` command, and how do I use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `zcrawjoinsplit` command splices a joinsplit into a raw transaction. It requires specific inputs, such as `rawtx`, `inputs`, and `outputs`, as well as `vpub_old` and `vpub_new` values. The inputs are unilaterally confidential, while the outputs are confidential between the sender and receiver. Make sure you have all the necessary inputs ready before running the command.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Can you explain how to use the `zcbenchmark` command to benchmark a blockchain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `zcbenchmark` command doesn't benchmark a blockchain network. It actually runs a benchmark of a selected type a specified number of times, returning the running times of each sample. The correct syntax is `zcbenchmark benchmarktype samplecount`. So, you'd specify the type of benchmark you want to run and how many times you want to run it, and the command will give you the results.",
