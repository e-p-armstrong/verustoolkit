    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a few more questions about Verus. How do the fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool get distributed back to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool do not get distributed back to the Verus blockchain. Instead, they are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent or fees going back to the Verus blockchain. This allows for seamless connectivity between blockchains without any additional costs or fees. Do you have any other questions about the fees or liquidity pool?\n\n**User:**\nAnother thing I've been wondering about is launching a blockchain-based currency. Is it possible to launch a blockchain-based currency without minimum participation or refunds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it is not possible to launch a blockchain-based currency without minimum participation or refunds. The launch options provided by Verus allow for setting required minimum levels of worldwide participation in preferred currencies on the chain. If these minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, minus network fees. This ensures that there is a certain level of participation and commitment before a blockchain is launched.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I'm curious about the scalability of the Verus network. Is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network limited to a specific number of interoperable blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is not limited to a specific number of interoperable blockchains. In fact, it allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network, with no limit on the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. This makes Verus a highly scalable solution for blockchain interoperability. Do you have any other questions about the Verus network or its capabilities?",
