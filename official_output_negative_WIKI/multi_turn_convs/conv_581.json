    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have some more questions about VerusIDs. Can I buy and sell VerusIDs off-chain, without using the blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs can only be bought and sold on-chain, using the blockchain. This allows for a completely decentralized and transparent way of executing transactions, with the ability to advertise offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of an NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. This transparency is a core aspect of the Verus ecosystem. Do you have any other questions about buying and selling VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question: Is it possible to execute transactions using VerusIDs without paying or offering to pay from a transparent address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, with VerusIDs, you can pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, which is still auditable by you. This allows for flexible and secure transaction execution. The private address option ensures that your transaction history remains private, while still maintaining the transparency and security of the blockchain. Does that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nI've also been looking into Verus Vault, and I'm not sure if I understand how it works. Can I use Verus Vault to protect funds on a VerusID without having a primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, enabling revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities requires you to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. Without this setup, you cannot use Verus Vault to protect your funds. This is a crucial security measure to ensure that your funds are safe and can be recovered in case something goes wrong. If you're unsure about how to set up your VerusID or Verus Vault, I'd be happy to help you with that!",
