    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble importing WIFs using the `run z_importkey` command. Can you explain why I need to import all WIFs one by one using the `run z_importkey \"<wif>\" \"yes\" 1` command for each WIF?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you don't need to import all WIFs one by one. Instead, you can import all WIFs except for the final one using the `run z_importkey \"<wif>\" \"no\"` command, and then import the final WIF using the `run z_importkey \"<wif>\" \"yes\" 1` command. This triggers the chain to rescan all addresses in your wallet, including all the addresses you just imported. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks! I was also wondering if the GUI wallet shows the progress of the import and gives no error messages during the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not the case. The GUI wallet will not show any progress on the import and may give messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting. The process will take quite some time to finish in the background, especially if the address has many transactions on it. You just need to be patient and let it complete.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question: Can I use a sample WIF to import my addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you should not use a sample WIF to import your addresses. Instead, you should use the WIF from the CLI-interface in Verus Desktop. This ensures that you're using the correct WIF for your specific addresses.",
