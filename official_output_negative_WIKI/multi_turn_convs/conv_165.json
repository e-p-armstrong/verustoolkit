    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about Verus Vault. How do I use Verus Vault to instantly unlock funds without any delay?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can't use Verus Vault to instantly unlock funds without any delay. Verus Vault is a time-locking technology that allows for delayed lock opening, which means that there will always be a delay between the time when the unlock process is initiated and when the funds are actually available. This delay can be set using the `timelock` parameter, which defines either the unlock height of the identity or the number of blocks to delay an ID's unlock. So, unfortunately, there's no way to bypass the delay.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I also had a question about revoking a locked identity. Can a locked identity revoke itself using Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself using Verus Vault. A locked identity cannot revoke itself. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. So, if you need to revoke an identity, you'll need to do it separately from the lock.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question, this one about testnet coins and currencies. Are testnet coins and currencies on VRSCTEST valuable and permanent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, testnet coins and currencies on VRSCTEST have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. This is explicitly stated in the documentation. So, don't get too attached to your testnet coins - they're just for testing purposes!",
