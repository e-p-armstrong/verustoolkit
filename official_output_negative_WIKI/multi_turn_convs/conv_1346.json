    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new currency on Verus, but I'm having some issues. How do I define a new currency without funding it with VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate the currency launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't define a new currency without funding it with VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate the currency launch. In order to launch a new currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command. Additionally, you need to have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at the specified conversion rate in order to launch the currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, I think. But what about after the currency has launched? Can I create new tokens of a currency without using the centralized issuance option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, currently, the only way to create new tokens of a currency after it has launched is through a centralized issuance option. There is no decentralized way to create new tokens of a currency after its launch.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question. What happens if I try to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token has launched?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you try to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token has launched, the conversion will be parked until the token launches. When the token launches, you will either receive the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet or have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.",
