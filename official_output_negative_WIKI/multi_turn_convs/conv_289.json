    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create an NFT token using Verus, but I'm not sure about the options. Is the OPTION_NFT_TOKEN option used to create a multi-satoshi NFT token?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, actually, the OPTION_NFT_TOKEN option is used to create a single satoshi NFT token, which tokenizes control over the root ID. It's not for creating multi-satoshi NFT tokens.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that helps clarify things. What about the OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER option? Can I set it to any value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER option has a specific value, which is 1024. Similarly, the OPTION_NFT_TOKEN option has a specific value, which is 2048. You'll need to use those exact values for these options.",
