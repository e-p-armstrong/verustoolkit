    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard some rumors about VerusHash and its relationship with FPGAs. Can you clarify things for me? Specifically, why did VerusHash 2.0 block FPGAs from being used on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been some misinformation going around! VerusHash 2.0 did not block FPGAs from being used on the Verus network. In fact, it was designed to equalize the performance of FPGAs and modern CPUs, allowing FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with some adjustments. The goal was to keep FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU, which was achieved. So, FPGAs are still very much welcome on the Verus network!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! I've also heard about VerusHash 2.1. What's the main purpose of this adjustment?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 is an adjustment to the equalization technology introduced in VerusHash 2.0, aiming to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. It's not intended to block or disfavor FPGAs, but rather to achieve a better balance between CPUs and FPGAs. The goal is to create a more diverse and robust network.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard some concerns about the potential for inflation with the introduction of VerusHash 2.1. Will this lead to inflation of the currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the introduction of VerusHash 2.1 will not lead to inflation of the currency. The identity rewards that will be streamed from the network will not inflate the currency. These rewards are expected to far exceed the potential for block rewards. So, you don't have to worry about inflation with VerusHash 2.1.",
