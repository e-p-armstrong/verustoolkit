    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there! I've been experimenting with b-addresses, and I have a few questions. How can I prevent my funds from getting locked when sending to a b-address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't prevent funds from getting locked when sending to a b-address. Funds sent to a b-address will always get locked, similar to the original coinbase reward. However, because they were not sent using a script to lock those coins, they can be retrieved without waiting the full unlock period.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But I'm still a bit unsure about using b-addresses. Is it recommended to send funds to a b-address if I'm not sure what I'm doing?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not recommended to send funds to a b-address unless you know what you're doing. It's important to understand the implications of using b-addresses and how they work before sending funds to one.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question. Can I use the `listunspent` command to retrieve the TXID of the locked funds without specifying the b-address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you need to specify the b-address when using the `listunspent` command to retrieve the TXID of the locked funds. The correct command is `run listunspent 0 <BLOCKCOUNT> '[\"<YOUR-b-ADDRESS>\"]'`, where `<YOUR-b-ADDRESS>` is the actual b-address where the coins are.",

The easiest way is to obtain the TXID from the send transaction you did in Verus-Desktop to the b-address. Make a copy of the TXID: you will need it for this procedure\n2. The next easiest way is look up the b-address on the [explorer](https://explorer.verus.io) and examine the transactions to this address. The youngest transaction is usually the one you need. On the explorer the hash in the transaction is the TXID. Make a copy of the TXID: you will need it for this procedure\n3.
