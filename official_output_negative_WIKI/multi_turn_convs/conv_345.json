    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to figure out how to use the new \"getidentitywithprivateaddress\" API to lookup identities. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. There is no \"getidentitywithprivateaddress\" API. The new APIs introduced in this release are actually \"getidentitywithaddress\", \"getidentitywithrevocation\", and \"getidentitywithrecovery\", which can be used to lookup identities by their primary addresses or revocation and recovery addresses, respectively.\n\nWould you like more information on how to use these APIs?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the correction! I've got another question. Can I use any type of ID to create a new currency with unlimited supply in this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, in this release, you can use any type of ID or sub-ID to create a new kind of currency, but it will always have a 1 Satoshi supply, not unlimited supply. This type of currency is called tokenized ID control and gives the holder power over the ID that issued it.",
