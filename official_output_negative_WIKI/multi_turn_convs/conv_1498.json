    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I need some help with my Verus wallet. How do I reset my mainnet wallet by deleting the specified directories?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the instructions you're referring to are for resetting your testnet wallet, not mainnet. To reset your testnet, make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon is running) and delete the specified directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native). You don't want to delete the wrong directories and risk losing your mainnet funds! Do you have any other questions about testnet or mainnet wallets?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification. I've also been wondering, can you explain how to execute transactions on Verus using intermediaries?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus ID and NFT Marketplace allows you to execute transactions in a completely decentralized way, without any intermediary necessary. You can buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. You can pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. This way, you have full control and transparency over your transactions, without needing to rely on intermediaries. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI see. I've heard that Verus is capable of launching tokens and currencies on-chain. Is that all it can do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus is capable of much more than just launching tokens and currencies on-chain. It can also launch liquidity basket AMMs, independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming, and more. Verus is a powerful and flexible platform that enables a wide range of use cases and applications. Its capabilities go far beyond just token and currency creation. Do you have any other questions about what Verus can do?",
