    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a few questions about executing transactions on the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. How do you execute transactions on the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace through a centralized intermediary?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you don't need a centralized intermediary at all. On the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, directly peer-to-peer, without any intermediary necessary. You can buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. I have another question. Is it possible to spend funds from a VerusID that is locked with Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it is not possible to spend funds from a VerusID that is locked with Verus Vault. If you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. However, you can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! And one more question. Do you need multiple IDs to enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need multiple IDs. You need at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured to enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities.",
