    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit worried about staying connected to the testnet. Is it necessary to upgrade to v0.9.9 to stay connected?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, it is necessary to upgrade to v0.9.9, not just for the mainnet, but also for continued use of the testnet. This is because v0.9.9 is a MANDATORY release, and failing to upgrade will result in unreliable connections to both mainnet and testnet after the first preparatory PBaaS upgrade is triggered. Make sure to upgrade as soon as possible to avoid any issues.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also concerned about verifying the integrity of the files I download. How do I verify a downloaded file using the `verus` command without a signature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't verify a downloaded file using the `verus` command without a signature. The `verus` command requires a signature, either directly from the file or by verifying a checksum, to verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded file. Make sure to always download files from trusted sources and verify the signatures to ensure the files are authentic and un tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nI'm a bit concerned about the deadline to upgrade to v0.9.9. What happens if I don't upgrade within the 1-week deadline?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe 1-week deadline mentioned is a soft fork, and the actual deadline may be shorter if a majority of the validating network upgrades earlier. If you don't upgrade to v0.9.9 before the activation is triggered, you will not be able to stay reliably connected to mainnet and testnet. It's essential to upgrade as soon as possible to avoid any disruptions to your connections. Don't wait until the last minute, and make sure to upgrade to v0.9.9 to ensure uninterrupted access to the network.",
