    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been following the Verus project and was wondering about the Ethereum gateway/bridge. Why did the team delay its release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the team didn't delay the release of the Ethereum gateway/bridge. They're planning to launch it soon, after first vetting it on the release testing network with community test volunteers. So, it's still on track to be released, just making sure it's thoroughly tested before going live.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I've also been wondering, what's the main focus of the Verus platform?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main focus of the Verus platform is not to create a social network, but rather to provide a platform for self-sovereign, decentralized applications and experiences. While the VDXF keys and profiles are an exciting development, the core technology is meant to be leveraged by businesses and entrepreneurs to enable new, decentralized user experiences and applications.\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about the Ethereum bridge too... Will it only support a limited number of ERC20 currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Ethereum bridge is not limited to supporting only a certain number of ERC20 currencies. In fact, support has been added for some additional, popular ERC20 currencies in anticipation of more usage after the release of the ETH bridge. This suggests that more currencies may be added in the future.",

            "1. Testnet reset with fixes for all reported PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID user issues. If you had reported issues, please verify that the issues you reported are addressed in this release.\n2. Support for the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge, which has been testing on private networks and which we hope to launch within a day or two after first vetting it on the release testing network with community test volunteers.\n3. Support for the new `getvdxfid` RPC call, used along with your ID and published names to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys, which community members used to create the world\u2019s first self-sovereign, completely decentralized, rent-free, non-cancelable social media profiles as can be seen here: https://luckpool.net/profile/identity/mike.vrsc . Work is underway to document the VDXF keys defined and used for profiles as well as the process of setting up your own. While the capability is already extremely powerful, we should remind everyone that Verus is a platform, not a social network. The core technology is exciting, but what will be even more exciting is when businesses and entrepreneurs leverage it to enable new, self-sovereign user experiences, applications, and accompanying businesses to enable the future, truly decentralized web.\n4. Fix for the Electron certificate issue in the GUI wallet, which has been affecting prices and preventing BTC fee calculation.\n5. Support for some additional, popular ERC20 currencies, in anticipation of more usage after release of the ETH bridge.\n6. Fix in GUI for calculated balances of specific addresses sometimes showing lower than actual, even though wallet balance displayed correctly.\n7. Additional hardening, fixes and improvement focused on mainnet and the Ethereum bridge.",
