    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about decentralized currencies and ID registration. Is it true that all decentralized currencies can only issue IDs using a centralized payment currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. All fractional and centralized currencies can issue IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, and permission from the currency identity required. It's not limited to centralized payment currencies.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Can the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies only be set in the primary currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves, such as USDC or DAI. You have some flexibility when it comes to setting the minimum price.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Is there a limit to the levels of referral support for ID registration fees?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is a limit. Each currency can have multiple levels of referral support, but there is a limit of 5 levels. You can't have an unlimited number of referral levels, but 5 should be sufficient for most use cases. Do you have any other questions about ID registration or decentralized currencies?",
