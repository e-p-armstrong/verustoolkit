    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find arbitrage opportunities between specific currency pairs. Can you help me with that? How do I use it to query a specific currency pair?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getcurrencyconverters` API isn't designed for that purpose. Instead, it allows you to query any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies and determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity. It's not meant for finding arbitrage opportunities between specific currency pairs. Would you like more information on how it works or alternative solutions for finding arbitrage opportunities?\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about Verus Vault technology and I was wondering if I can use it to unlock my funds instantly in case of an emergency.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not what Verus Vault technology is designed for. Verus Vault technology is actually an advanced time lock capability that doesn't prevent staking on locked funds. This allows for easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. It's not intended for instant unlocking of funds in case of an emergency. It's more about providing an additional layer of security and control over your funds. Would you like more information on how it works?\n\n**User:**\nI thought I read that Verus Vault technology was only available for VerusIDs that are not revocable or recoverable. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Verus Vault technology extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability. This means that Verus Vault technology is available for VerusIDs that are revocable and recoverable, not limited to non-revocable or non-recoverable IDs. So, you can take advantage of the advanced time lock features while still maintaining the benefits of revocability and recoverability.",
