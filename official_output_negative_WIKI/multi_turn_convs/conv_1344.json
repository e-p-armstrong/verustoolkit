    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to define a new currency, \"mycoin\", and I'm not sure about one of the settings. What is the purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to 2 in the `definecurrency` command for \"mycoin\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you set `proofprotocol` to 2 in the `definecurrency` command for \"mycoin\", it allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. This corresponds to PROOF_CHAINID. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! So, after I define \"mycoin\" with `proofprotocol` set to 2, can anyone mint new coins in \"mycoin\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins in \"mycoin\". This is because the `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID, giving the chain ID controller this authority. So, it's not open to anyone, but rather restricted to the controller of the chain ID.",
