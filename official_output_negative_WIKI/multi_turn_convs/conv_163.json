    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm playing around with creating my own currency on the Verus platform, and I was wondering, can anyone mint new coins in the \"mycoin\" currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not anyone can mint new coins in the \"mycoin\" currency. The controller of the chain ID has the authority to mint new coins. This is because the proof protocol is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. \n\nTo demonstrate this, you can use the command `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'`. This command shows how the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins in the \"mycoin\" currency.",
