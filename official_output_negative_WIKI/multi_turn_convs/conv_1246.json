    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been studying the Verus DeFi protocol and I'm curious about how it handles miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running in currency conversions. Can you explain how it allows for this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus DeFi protocol takes a different approach. It addresses and prevents miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running in currency conversions, rather than allowing them. It does this by ensuring that all currency conversions using a particular liquidity pool and mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This design helps to prevent unfair advantages and ensures a more equitable experience for all users.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also been looking into the bridge converter liquidity pool and I'm not entirely sure how it works. Can you explain how it takes a percentage of fees generated on the new blockchain and sends them back to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion here. The bridge converter liquidity pool doesn't actually take a percentage of fees generated on the new blockchain and send them back to the Verus blockchain. Instead, all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. The connection between the two blockchains is seamless, but the fees stay on the new blockchain. Does that clarify things?",
