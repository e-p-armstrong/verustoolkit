    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about some updates to the Verus network, and I'm a bit concerned. What happens if a notary, pool, or exchange fails to upgrade to version v0.7.3-6 before notary changes take effect on block 1562500?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDon't worry, it's not the end of the world if a notary, pool, or exchange fails to upgrade to version v0.7.3-6 before the notary changes take effect on block 1562500. Failing to update to version v0.7.3-6 will not prevent connection to the network. However, updating in a timely manner will ensure a stronger, notarized connection to the Verus blockchain. So, it's still important to upgrade as soon as possible to take advantage of the new features and security enhancements.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been wondering, can I only use command-line interfaces to interact with the new Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you're not limited to just command-line interfaces. You can use both an easy GUI for basic operations and the command line for more advanced functions to interact with the new Verus testnet. This way, you can choose the interface that best fits your needs and comfort level. The GUI is perfect for those who want a more intuitive experience, while the command line provides more advanced features for power users.",
