    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about VerusIDs. How do you set the revocation authority to someone else's ID in VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can set the revocation authority to someone else's ID by specifying that ID as the revocation authority. This allows the specified ID to revoke your identity, creating a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents your identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI've also been wondering, are VerusIDs not private at all?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's not correct. VerusIDs are private in the sense that each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations. They offer a high level of privacy and control over your digital identity.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Can you only define one primary address for a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses for a VerusID, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). This provides an additional layer of security and control over your identity.",
