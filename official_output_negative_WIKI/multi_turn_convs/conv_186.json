    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the currency definition in Verus, and I came across the \"idreferrallevels\" field. Can you explain what it does? Specifically, does it dictate the number of confirmations required for an ID to be considered valid?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not what it does. The \"idreferrallevels\" field specifies the number of levels of ID referrals, which is only applicable to native PBaaS chains and IDs. It doesn't have anything to do with the number of confirmations required for an ID to be considered valid.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I'm also trying to set up a foreign coin, and I'm looking at the \"eras\" object. I see a \"reward\" field - how do I use that to set the reward for each era in the foreign coin?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the \"reward\" field in the \"eras\" object sets the reward start for each era in the native coin, not in a foreign coin. So, you wouldn't use that field to set the reward for a foreign coin.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification. One more question - I'm looking at the \"nodes\" field, and I want to specify a bunch of nodes that can be used to connect to the blockchain. Can I use this field to specify more than 8 nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, unfortunately not. The \"nodes\" field is an optional object array that allows you to specify up to 8 nodes that can be used to connect to the blockchain, but not more than 8.",
