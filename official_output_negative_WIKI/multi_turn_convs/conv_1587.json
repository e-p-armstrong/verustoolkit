    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have a few questions about creating currencies and IDs on the Verus network. Can I create a currency with an i-address as its name without any issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. Creating an ID with an i-address as its name is not recommended and will cause problems when trying to use that ID or name. The protocol does not prevent this, but it's not supported for creating currencies and will lead to confusion. It's best to avoid doing so. You should choose a unique and descriptive name for your currency to avoid any potential issues. Do you have any other questions about creating currencies or IDs?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. Is it possible to use the same name for a PBaaS chain as a currency that is already supported in the Verus Desktop, like BTC or ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, currently, you cannot use the same name for a PBaaS chain as a currency that is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH. This is a limitation in the current testnet release, but it will be resolved before mainnet availability. You'll need to choose a unique name for your PBaaS chain to avoid any conflicts. Do you have any other questions about PBaaS chains or currency creation?\n\n**User:**\nGot it. One more question. Is the software provided with any kind of warranty or guarantee?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is provided \"as is\" and \"at your own risk\". There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the disclaimer explicitly states this. You should carefully review the terms and conditions before using the software. It's important to understand that you're responsible for any risks associated with using the software. Do you have any other questions or concerns?",
