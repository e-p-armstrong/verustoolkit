    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand the different flags used in Verus chain definitions, but I'm a bit confused. Can you help me out? Specifically, what does the OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY flag do in a PBaaS chain definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY flag isn't specifically for PBaaS chain definitions. It's a flag that can be used to potentially restrict a chain or gateway to a single currency. So, it's not specific to PBaaS chain definitions.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Another question I had was about the OPTION_PBAAS flag. I thought it indicated a gateway converter, but I'm not sure.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. OPTION_PBAAS is a flag that indicates a PBaaS chain definition, not a gateway converter. The flag for a gateway converter is actually OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER.\n\n**User:**\nAlright, that clears things up. And one more question: I was wondering about the OPTION_NFT_TOKEN flag. Does it enable NFTs on a chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot exactly. The OPTION_NFT_TOKEN flag is more specific than that. It's a flag that indicates a single satoshi NFT token, which tokenizes control over the root ID. It doesn't simply enable NFTs on a chain.",
