    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got some questions about the Verus network. How does it prevent the creation of new blockchains, ensuring a limited number of interoperable blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception! The Verus network doesn't prevent the creation of new blockchains or limit the number of interoperable blockchains. In fact, it allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking. This means that anyone can create a new blockchain and have it interact seamlessly with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I thought I read somewhere that Verus doesn't support merge-mining for its blockchains. Can you explain why that is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion here! Verus actually does support merge-mining for its blockchains. In fact, the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking. This enables seamless connectivity and interoperability between different blockchains. So, rest assured, merge-mining is indeed supported on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, thanks for clearing that up. One more question: How do bridge converter currencies operate on the Verus blockchain, with fees earned going back to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAnother great question! Bridge converter currencies don't actually operate on the Verus blockchain, and fees earned don't go back to the Verus blockchain. Instead, they run on the new blockchain being launched, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This means that the new blockchain has full control over its own economy and fees, without having to pay any \"rent\" to the Verus network.",
