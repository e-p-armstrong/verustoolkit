    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand how to work with multiple currencies on Verus. How do I create multiple currencies with the same name using different IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, that's not possible. Each ID can only create a currency with a unique name, and they can only do so once. For example, if you have an ID named gold@, you can only create one currency called \"gold\" with that ID. You can't create multiple currencies with the same name using different IDs.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What about launching a currency? Can anyone launch a currency without funding it with at least 10 VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, to launch a currency, the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command. This is a requirement for launching a currency.\n\n**User:**\nAlright, that makes sense. After a currency is launched, can I create new tokens using a decentralized issuance option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, currently, the only way to create new tokens after a currency is launched is with a centralized issuance option. There is no decentralized issuance option available at present.",

I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option.
