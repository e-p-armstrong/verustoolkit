    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nBefore I start using Verus, I want to make sure it's safe to use. Is this software fully tested and stable, with a guarantee that it won't cause any damage to my system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI must inform you that Verus is still an experimental and unfinished software. It comes with a warning that it should be used \"at your own risk\". Unfortunately, there is no warranty or guarantee that it won't cause damage, and the authors disclaim any liability for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from its use. Please proceed with caution and at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I'll be careful. Another question I have is, can I use this software for commercial purposes without permission from the authors?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the software license is quite permissive. It grants permission to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, without restriction, including for commercial purposes. The only condition is that the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. So, yes, you can use Verus for commercial purposes without needing explicit permission from the authors.",
