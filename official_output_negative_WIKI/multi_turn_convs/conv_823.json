    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to use the `currencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have at least 100 VRSC in reserve. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI can help with that. However, I have to correct you - the `currencyconverters` API actually retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, not 100 VRSC. Additionally, the currencies must also have a reserve ratio greater than 10% VRSC and have all listed currencies as reserves. Would you like me to explain how to use the API correctly?\n\n**User:**\nI see, thanks for the correction. But what's the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` command anyway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` command is used to retrieve all currencies that have markets at or above the liquidity threshold for the specified currencies. For example, `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold. It doesn't have any other purpose than this.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, can I use the `currencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have a VRSC reserve ratio of less than 10%?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `currencyconverters` API only retrieves currencies that have a VRSC reserve ratio greater than 10%, not less than 10%. If you need to retrieve currencies with a reserve ratio less than 10%, you'll need to use a different API or method.",
