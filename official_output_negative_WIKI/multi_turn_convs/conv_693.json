    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating my own coin on the Verus network, and I was wondering, can anyone mint new coins for \"mycoin\" after it's defined?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! No, only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins for \"mycoin\" after it's defined, because `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. This ensures that the control of minting new coins remains with the creator of the coin, and not just anyone can create new coins for your coin.",
