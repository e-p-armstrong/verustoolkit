    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got some more questions about Verus. How does Verus's ID system rely on Komodo compatible crypto-conditions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception. Verus's ID system doesn't rely on Komodo compatible crypto-conditions. Instead, it was made possible through the use of Verus Smart Transactions, which replace the use of Komodo compatible crypto-conditions. This new technology is unique to the Verus network and will be available for everyone to use on their own blockchains in the upcoming PBaaS network upgrade. So, Komodo compatible crypto-conditions aren't actually involved in Verus's ID system. Do you have any more questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question I had was about VerusHash 2.0. What is the main goal of the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to clarify. The main goal of the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was not to block FPGAs completely from the Verus network, as some people might think. Instead, the actual goal of VerusHash 2.0 was to equalize FPGAs' dominance over CPUs, not block them completely. This algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs, and it has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU.",

The Verus ID system was made possible through the use of Verus Smart Transactions, which will be available for everyone to use on their own blockchains in the upcoming PBaaS network upgrade. Verus Smart Transactions use standard Bitcoin style serialization rather than the ASN.1 used in crypto conditions, which makes support on lite or mobile wallets simpler to implement than the crypto-condition protocol, which is still used on the Verus network for Stake Guard.\n## VerusHash 2.1\nVerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards",
