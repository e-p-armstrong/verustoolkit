    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to start the CLI walletdaemon for the mainnet. I was told to use a specific command, but I'm not sure if it's correct. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe command you were given is actually for starting the CLI walletdaemon for the testnet, not the mainnet. The correct command for the testnet is `verusd -chain=VRSCTEST`. If you want to start the CLI walletdaemon for the mainnet, you would use a different command, without the `-chain=VRSCTEST` option.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Can I use the same commands for the CLI wallet on both the mainnet and testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the commands for the CLI wallet are slightly different for the mainnet and testnet. For the testnet, you need to add the `-chain=VRSCTEST` option, whereas for the mainnet, you would not use this option. The format for the testnet is `verus -chain=VRSCTEST`, while for the mainnet, it would be just `verus`. So, be sure to use the correct command depending on which network you're working with.",
