    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to define a chain using the `definechain` command. Can I define a chain with 5 eras?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, you cannot define a chain with 5 eras using the `definechain` command. The maximum number of eras allowed is 3. You'll need to adjust your design to fit within that limitation.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, I'm planning to make a chain, and I'm wondering about the wallet requirements. What is the minimum number of VRSCTEST required in a wallet to make a chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is no specific minimum number of VRSCTEST required in a wallet to make a chain. VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet to make a chain, but the exact amount is not specified. You'll need to ensure you have enough VRSCTEST to cover the chain creation process.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. And what about contributions? Will a chain always start regardless of the amount of contributions received?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a chain will not always start regardless of the amount of contributions received. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors. So, it's essential to ensure you have enough contributions to meet the minimum requirements for the chain to start successfully.",
