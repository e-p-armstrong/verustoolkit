    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about creating a chain on Verus. What happens if the minimum contributions are not met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors. So, it's important to ensure that you have enough support and contributions to meet the minimum requirements.\n\n**User:**\nI've been looking at some chain definition examples, and I had a question about the conversion price. Does the chain definition example convert all contributions to the native chain currency at a 50%, 2:1 conversion price?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no. The example chain definition actually converts all contributions to the native chain currency at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. So, it's a straightforward one-to-one conversion. Do you have any more questions about chain definitions or creating a chain on Verus?",
