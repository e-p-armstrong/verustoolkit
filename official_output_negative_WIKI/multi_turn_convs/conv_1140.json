    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to connect to a defined chain, but I don't want to run the local VRSCTEST chain. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to connect to a defined chain without running the local VRSCTEST chain at least once. When you run the command `./komodod -chain=SOMECOIN` for the first time, a local config file is created, which allows you to connect to the chain without running VRSCTEST subsequently.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that VRSCTEST\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f is still needed to merge mine. So, while you don't need to run VRSCTEST every time you connect to the chain, you do need to run it at least once to set up the connection. Does that make sense?",

            "**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:**\n```\n./komodod -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\nOn first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
