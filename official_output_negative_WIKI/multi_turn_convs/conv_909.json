    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about verifying a download. How do I verify a download without using the provided txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't. The txt file is necessary for verifying the download. The file contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, which are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the download. The verification process involves extracting the downloaded archive, verifying the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extracting the archive to the desired directory. Without the txt file, you won't be able to verify the download.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if the signature is invalid when verifying a download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the signature is invalid, the result will not be \"true\". The command will return \"false\" or an error message indicating that the signature is invalid. This means that the download has been tampered with or is not a legitimate release from the \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" identity.\n\n**User:**\nI've got another question. What's the main change in v0.9.9-4?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main change in v0.9.9-4 is not a functional change, but rather a low-level stakeguard improvement. This release is recommended for mainnet and mandatory for reliable testnet operation. Additionally, it fixes an issue that was causing testnet users to experience sync issues on chains that had more than one oracle upgrade for the same capability activated.",
