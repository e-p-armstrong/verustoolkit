    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about verifying downloads. How do I verify a download without using a signature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, verifying a download requires using a signature. A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is included for each download. To verify a download, you need to extract the downloaded archive, verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extract the archive to the desired directory. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification. I've been playing around with the new API additions in RC3 of the PBaaS protocol, and I was wondering, is it possible to generate multiple tokens as a currency for an ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, RC3 of the PBaaS protocol allows any ID to generate a single token as its currency, not multiple tokens. This single token enables whoever holds it to have an additional level of revoke/recover power over the ID. Do you have any more questions about the PBaaS protocol or token generation?\n\n**User:**\nI've got a related question. Can I use the `verifyfile` command to verify a download without specifying the identity of the signer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `verifyfile` command requires specifying the identity of the signer, in this case, \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". The correct syntax is:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"signature\" \"file_path\"\n```\nMake sure to include the signer's identity when using the `verifyfile` command. Does that help?",
