    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with VerusIDs and I noticed something interesting. Can you explain why I can create a currency from an ID with a properly encoded i-address as its actual name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can't. The protocol advises against creating an ID with an i-address as its name, as it will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used. This is because an i-address will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. It's not recommended to use an i-address as an ID name.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was also wondering, is it possible to create a PBaaS chain with the same name as a currency already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible. The Verus Desktop has a limitation in this testnet release that prevents you from using the same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification. One more question: is this software considered stable and fully tested?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not. The software is explicitly labeled as \"experimental and unfinished\" and comes with a disclaimer that it should be used at your own risk, with no warranty for any kind of damage. So, please be careful when using it and keep in mind that it's still a work in progress.",
