    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having some trouble with my testnet and I want to reset it. What's the simplest way to do that without restarting the testnet daemon?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to reset the testnet without restarting the daemon. To reset your testnet, you need to make sure Verus is closed and no testnet daemon is running, then delete the specified directories, and afterwards restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native).\n\n**User:**\nSo, if I just delete the specified directories, will that reset the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, deleting the specified directories alone is not enough to reset the testnet. You need to make sure Verus is closed and no testnet daemon is running before deleting the directories, and then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native) to complete the reset process.\n\n**User:**\nCan I at least reset my testnet while the testnet daemon is still running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot reset your testnet while the testnet daemon is still running. You need to make sure Verus is closed and no testnet daemon is running before deleting the specified directories and restarting the testnet daemon (or relaunching Verus Desktop, deactivating verustest, and re-adding verustest native) to reset the testnet.",
