    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the Verus blockchain and I have a few questions. How does the Verus blockchain take a percentage of fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool on new blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus blockchain doesn't take a percentage of fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool on new blockchains. All fees earned on the new blockchain stay on that blockchain, with no \"rent\" going back to the Verus blockchain. The connection between the blockchains is seamless, without any fees being siphoned off.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering, can you explain why Verus only allows for a limited number of blockchains to operate on its network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there is no limit to the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on the Verus network. The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, with decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation provided by Notary IDs specified at chain definition. This enables public blockchains to be merge mined and staked, as well as private, internal blockchains to be easily set up with bridging of public currencies.\n\n**User:**\nAnother question I had was, how do you launch a currency on the Verus network without a minimum participation requirement or automatic refunds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus network does provide for minimum participation requirements and automatic refunds for currency launches. You can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on the chain, and if these minimums are not met by the start time of your blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. This ensures that there is a sufficient level of participation and support for the new currency.",
