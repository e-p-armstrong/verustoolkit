    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating my own decentralized token or blockchain on Verus, but I've heard it requires extensive programming knowledge. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, creating a decentralized token or blockchain on Verus does not require extensive programming knowledge. With Verus, any user with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain without needing to program. This is possible because Verus enables users to create their own tokens and blockchains through a user-friendly interface, eliminating the need for programming expertise. So, don't let that hold you back from exploring the possibilities of Verus!\n\n**User:**\nThat's really good to know! I've also been wondering about Verus DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets. How do they work if they're not integrated into the consensus protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Verus DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets are, in fact, integrated into the consensus protocol. This integration ensures that all currency conversions using a particular liquidity pool and mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing issues like miner-extracted value (MEV) and front-running. The integration also provides fee-based DeFi incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities. So, you can rest assured that these features are seamlessly integrated into the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. One more question: is it true that launching a new blockchain on Verus requires a separate, manual setup of a bridge converter liquidity pool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. With Verus, the launch of a new blockchain is accompanied by the simultaneous launch of a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool as part of defining the new blockchain. This bridge converter currency has the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies and is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, running on the new blockchain. So, you don't need to worry about setting up a separate bridge converter liquidity pool; it's all taken care of automatically when you launch your new blockchain on Verus.",
