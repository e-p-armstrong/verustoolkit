    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to register a name commitment and identity, and I was wondering, can you specify the parent in the `registernamecommitment` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot specify the parent in the `registernamecommitment` command. The parent is specified in the `registeridentity` command, within the identity definition itself. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about registering a name commitment and identity?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. I've also got a question about registering an identity. What happens if you set `returntx` to `false` when registering an identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you set `returntx` to `false` when registering an identity, the identity registration will be signed and submitted automatically. This is the opposite of what would happen if you set `returntx` to `true`, which would return a raw transaction for the identity owner to sign. So, by setting `returntx` to `false`, you're essentially automating the signing and submission process.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. One more question. Do you need to receive permission from the currency's identity to register a new identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you do not always need to receive permission from the currency's identity to register a new identity. Only if the currency's ID issuance requires permission from the currency's identity will you need to obtain that permission, which involves signing the name commitment and identity registration. But if permission isn't required, you can register the new identity without needing approval from the currency's identity. Does that make sense?",
