    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with my Verus wallet. It's stuck on block number 123456 and I'm not sure what to do. Can you help me troubleshoot the issue?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think I can help you out. The issue you're experiencing sounds similar to the problem where the wallet is stuck on block number XXXX. You might want to check out the troubleshooting guide for \"My wallet is stuck on block number XXXX. It does not synchronize properly anymore.\" as it might provide the solution you're looking for. Have you tried that yet?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I haven't tried that yet. I'll take a look. Thanks for the suggestion! By the way, I have another question. How do I recover funds I sent to an A-address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. There's no such thing as an A-address in Verus. Did you maybe mean to ask about recovering funds sent to a B-address? If that's the case, I can help you with that. If you accidentally sent funds to a B-address, you can follow these steps to recover them: [insert steps]. Let me know if that's what you were looking for!",
