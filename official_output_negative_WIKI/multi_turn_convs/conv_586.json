    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `definecurrency` command to set the proof protocol of \"mycoin\" to PROOF_WORK, which allows anyone to mint new coins. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misunderstanding. The `definecurrency` command doesn't actually allow you to set the proof protocol to PROOF_WORK. For example, if you set the proof protocol to 2, that corresponds to PROOF_CHAINID, not PROOF_WORK. This means that only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins, not anyone.\n\nSo, unfortunately, you can't use the `definecurrency` command to allow anyone to mint new coins. Would you like to know more about the different proof protocols and how they work in Verus?",
