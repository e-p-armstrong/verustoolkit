    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI was just trying to run `./verusd` on a Linux distro and I'm wondering, what is the error message I'll get if I've already installed the necessary libraries?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the error messages `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` and `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory` are indicators that the necessary libraries are not installed. If you've already installed the necessary libraries, you shouldn't receive these error messages. These error messages specifically indicate that the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries are not installed.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. If I do get these error messages, can I solve the error by installing only the libgomp library?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you need to install both the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries to solve the error. The command `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev` installs both of these necessary libraries. Installing only one of them will not resolve the issue. You need to have both libraries installed for `./verusd` to run correctly.",
