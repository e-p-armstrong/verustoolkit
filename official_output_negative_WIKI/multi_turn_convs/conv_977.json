    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about Verus software downloads. I've heard that antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag the Verus software as a virus. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Avast and Kaspersky do not flag the Verus software as a virus. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that you are installing mining software that could potentially be used to exploit your PC if installed by a third party.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But how can I verify the authenticity of a Verus software download if there is no signature or checksum provided?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, a txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is included for each download. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". You can verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, or verify the file directly using the `verifyfile` command, or verify using a checksum with the `verifyhash` command.\n\n**User:**\nI've also seen something about a v0.8.0-5 UPDATE. What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.8.0-5 UPDATE is a NON-MANDATORY update that fixes the remaining known bridge issues and adds security to ensure that you don't send to an unspendable address on any network by using the wrong format for a destination. It is only required for those continuing to help get testnet ready for mainnet.",
