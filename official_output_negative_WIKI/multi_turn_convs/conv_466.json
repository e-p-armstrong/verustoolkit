    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I just exported my wallet and I'm not sure what to do next. Can I simply leave the `mywalletexport` file in the komodo/VRSC directory and start using my wallet again?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, I wouldn't recommend that. You should not leave the `mywalletexport` file in the komodo/VRSC directory. You should delete the komodo/VRSC directory and everything in it, making sure to keep the `mywalletexport` file and your `wallet.dat` backup in a safe place. This is because the `mywalletexport` file contains your plaintext private keys and should be kept secure.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Before I import my wallet export file, do I need to upgrade my wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, that's a good idea. You should make sure you're on the latest version of your wallet before importing your wallet export file. Check the downloads section on the Verus website to ensure you're running the latest version, and upgrade if necessary, before restarting your wallet and importing your wallet export file.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And finally, how do I actually import my wallet export file? I think I need to use the `z_exportwallet` command, right?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. You should use the `z_importwallet` command to import your wallet export file, not `z_exportwallet`. The `z_importwallet` command is used to import the wallet export file, whereas `z_exportwallet` is not mentioned in the instructions and would likely be used to export a wallet, not import one. Make sure to use the correct command to avoid any issues with your wallet.",
