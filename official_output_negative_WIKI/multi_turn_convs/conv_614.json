    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been looking at the currency definitions in Verus, and I'm not sure what the `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` option does. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` option is actually set to 1, not 2. Its purpose is to allow reserve conversion using base calculations when set. It doesn't restrict ID creation to controlling IDs, which is the function of the `OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE` option.\n\nWould you like me to explain more about how reserve conversion works in Verus, or is there something else you'd like to know about currency definitions?",
