    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still trying to understand how VerusIDs work, especially when it comes to locking and revoking them. Can you explain why locked VerusIDs can never be revoked or recovered?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a common misconception. A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. This allows for a decentralized solution to the infamous 5-dollar wrench attack, where an unauthorized unlock can be detected and the funds can be recovered. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. I've also been looking into Verus Vault and how it provides security for IDs and NFTs. Can you explain how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault provides the same level of security for IDs and NFTs as traditional methods, plus additional features such as time locks for purposes like vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This provides a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, allowing users to protect and recover their funds without relying on a centralized authority.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen that you can set an unlock delay on a locked ID, but I don't understand the point of it. Doesn't it just make it easier for someone to steal your funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, setting an unlock delay on a locked ID provides a decentralized solution to the 5-dollar wrench attack. With a delay, even if an unauthorized unlock occurs, the revocation and recovery authority identities can detect it and recover the funds before they can be spent. This adds an extra layer of security and protection for users' assets. It doesn't make it easier for someone to steal your funds; instead, it gives you more time to react and protect your assets in case of an unauthorized unlock. Does that make sense?",
