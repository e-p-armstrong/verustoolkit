According to the page, it was submitted by two individuals: Oink.vrsc@ and Thoskk.vrsc@.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. I was worried because I'm having some issues with my wallet and I thought there might not be any solution.

You can find guidance on recovering from forking, network, or old wallet problems on a separate wiki page. It's not a dead end, and there are resources available to help you resolve your issues. Would you like me to help you find that page or guide you through the recovery process?",
