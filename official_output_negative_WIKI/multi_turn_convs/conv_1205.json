    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into the Verus DeFi protocol, and I have some questions about it. How does it allow miners to extract value (MEV) and engage in front-running, since these are known problems in DeFi?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus DeFi protocol does the opposite: it addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This design feature prevents MEV and front-running, rather than allowing them. So, you don't have to worry about these issues with Verus DeFi.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Another thing I was wondering about is the liquidity pool fees. I thought I read that they're allocated to the Verus blockchain, but that doesn't seem right. Can you explain why the liquidity pool fees are allocated to the Verus blockchain, rather than the new blockchain being launched?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not how it works. According to the protocol, all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This ensures that the new blockchain is self-sustaining and that the fees are allocated to the correct blockchain. So, the fees stay where they belong, on the new blockchain.",
