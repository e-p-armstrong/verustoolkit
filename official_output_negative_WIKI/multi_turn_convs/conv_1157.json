    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having some issues with my chain and I'm not sure what to do. If I'm on a forked chain due to a network issue or old wallet version, can I just keep mining on that chain and still receive valid rewards?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, that's not the case. If you're mining on a forked chain, the rewards you receive will be worthless. When you mine on the wrong chain, rewards may come in quickly, but they have no value. To resolve the issue, you need to follow one of the two procedures outlined: either install the latest bootstrap file or search manually for the forked block and invalidate it.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a bummer. Can I resolve the forked chain issue without stopping the wallet/mining process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't. You need to stop the wallet/mining process by cleanly shutting it down before you can update your wallet and bootstrap your chain to get back on track.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, is it recommended to search manually for the forked block and invalidate it instead of installing the latest bootstrap file?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not recommended. Installing the latest bootstrap file is the easier and less time-consuming solution, while searching manually for the forked block and invalidating it is a more time-consuming process. It's advised to follow the easier procedure unless you have specific reasons to choose the manual approach.",
