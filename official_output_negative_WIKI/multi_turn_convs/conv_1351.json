    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard some rumors about the Verus/Ethereum Bridge on the testnet. Can you confirm if v0.9.6 removed the Verus/Ethereum Bridge from the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not true. v0.9.6 did not remove the Verus/Ethereum Bridge from the testnet. In fact, it adds the upgraded Ethereum bridge to the Goerli testnet, making it live with all bridgekeeping, Ethereum Gas price tracking, and reward incentive capabilities for miners and stakers.\n\n**User:**\nSo, I can access the Ethereum bridge website to move over some Mainnet Ethereum or USDC?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not exactly. The Ethereum bridge website (https://ethtest.verus.services) allows users to move over some Goerli Ethereum or USDC, not Mainnet Ethereum or USDC. Goerli is a testnet, and the bridge is currently available for testing purposes.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about rewards for bridgekeeping on v0.9.6? Are they still available?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, rewards for bridgekeeping on v0.9.6 are still available and have actually been improved. Rewards are delivered on both the Verus and Ethereum blockchains. This means that bridgekeepers will receive rewards on both chains for their participation in the Verus/Ethereum Bridge.",
