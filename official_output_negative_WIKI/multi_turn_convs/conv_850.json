    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about PbaaS chain launches. Can I use the `refundfailedlaunch` command to refund contributions made to a successful PbaaS chain launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use the `refundfailedlaunch` command to refund contributions made to a successful PbaaS chain launch. The `refundfailedlaunch` command is specifically designed for refunding contributions made to a failed PbaaS chain launch, not a successful one.\n\nTo clarify, the correct command for refunding contributions to a failed launch is: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME`. This command is only intended for situations where the launch did not succeed, and contributors need to be refunded.\n\nIf you have any other questions about PbaaS chain launches or Verus in general, feel free to ask!",
