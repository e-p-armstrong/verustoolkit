    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to download the Verus software, but my antivirus keeps flagging it as a virus. What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help clarify. Avast and Kaspersky do not flag the Verus software as a virus. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software includes mining capabilities that could be exploited by a third party to misuse your PC. This is a common warning for cryptocurrency-related software. Don't worry, the Verus software is safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But how can I verify the downloads if there is no signature or checksum provided?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there is a way to verify the downloads. A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is included for each download. You can use this information to verify the signature and checksum of the downloaded archive. The CLI examples show how to do this using the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands. This way, you can ensure the integrity and authenticity of the downloads.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard rumors that the Verus Coin Foundation Releases identity is not used to sign the downloads. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. The downloads are indeed signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". You can use this identity to verify the signature of the downloads. We take the security and authenticity of our downloads very seriously, and we provide the necessary information for you to verify them.",
