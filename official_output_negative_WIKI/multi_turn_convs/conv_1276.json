    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to download Verus, but I've noticed that some antivirus software is flagging it as a potential threat. Are the VirusTotal detection results for Verus downloads a cause for concern?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI understand your concern. The VirusTotal detection results for Verus downloads are likely false positives. Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a common warning for mining software. These warnings are intended to inform users that they are installing mining software, which could be exploited by third parties to misuse their PC resources. However, Verus is a legitimate cryptocurrency project, and the warnings are simply a precautionary measure. You don't need to worry about the warnings; Verus is safe to download and use.\n\n**User:**\nI'm glad to hear that. I also had a question about verifying the downloads. Can I use any identity to sign and verify Verus downloads?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus downloads are signed with a specific identity, \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\", which is used to verify the authenticity of the packages. You must use this exact identity to verify the signature, as specified in the instructions. Using any other identity will result in a failed verification. It's important to follow the instructions carefully to ensure the integrity of the downloads.",
