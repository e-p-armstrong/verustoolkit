    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a few questions about VerusIDs. I've got one locked, and I was wondering, how do I immediately spend or access funds from it using only the primary keys?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't. With only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys, you must first unlock the VerusID and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before you can spend or access funds. This provides a security mechanism against unauthorized access.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, I suppose. I was also wondering, is it true that a locked VerusID can never be revoked or recovered?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard of Verus Vault, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. Does Verus Vault only provide security for funds and not for IDs and NFTs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance, in addition to funds. So, it's a more comprehensive security solution than just protecting your funds. Do you have any more questions about Verus Vault or VerusIDs in general?",
