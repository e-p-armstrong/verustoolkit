    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with the Verus API and I noticed something about the output. Is the \"pruned\" field always set to true in the output?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the \"pruned\" field is not always set to true. It is a boolean value that indicates whether the local chain is pruned or not. If the local chain is pruned, it will be set to true, otherwise it will be set to false. So, it really depends on the state of your local chain.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also looking at the \"softforks\" field and I was wondering, are softforks always enforced in the output?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, softforks are not always enforced in the output. The \"softforks\" field is an array that contains the status of softforks in progress, including their name, version, and enforcement progress. The \"enforce\" object within the softfork object shows the progress toward enforcing the softfork, but it does not mean that the softfork is always enforced. The enforcement of a softfork can be in progress, and the output will reflect that.",
