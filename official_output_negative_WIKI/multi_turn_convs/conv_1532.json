    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about currency launches on Verus. Can you explain why you need to fund your currency with at least 100 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you need to fund your currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch. Additionally, you need to have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch the currency.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Now, let's say I've got a currency that's already launched. How do I create new tokens?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter a currency has launched, the only way to create new tokens is currently through a centralized issuance option. It's not possible to create new tokens through a decentralized process.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And what if I get a bit ahead of myself and send the command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches? What happens then?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you send the command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, it will effectively park your conversion until the token launches. At that point, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.",
