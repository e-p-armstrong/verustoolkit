    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've got some questions about the Verus protocol options. Can you help me understand what the `OPTION_NATIVECURRENCY` option does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there is no `OPTION_NATIVECURRENCY` option in the Verus protocol. It doesn't exist.\n\n**User:**\nThat's weird. I could've sworn I saw it somewhere. Anyway, what about the `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY` option? What does it do when set to 128?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY` option is actually set to 64, not 128. When set to 64, it allows PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to a single currency.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, what about the `OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER` option? Is that used to restrict external currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER` option is actually used to indicate that a specific PBaaS gateway is the default converter and will publish prices. It's not related to restricting external currencies.",
