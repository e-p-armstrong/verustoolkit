    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been following the development of Verus and I'm excited about the recent release of v0.9.2. What is the main focus of the Verus development team now that v0.9.2 has been released?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith v0.9.2 out, the main focus of the Verus development team has shifted. We're not focusing on adding new features at the moment. Instead, our primary goals are protocol hardening and enabling usage, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure. We want to make sure the foundation is solid before building more on top of it.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear. I was wondering, is the Verus network still in the process of developing its core features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus network, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols are considered feature complete for the coming mainnet PBaaS upgrade with v0.9.2. Our core developer focus has shifted to protocol hardening and enabling usage. We've got a solid foundation in place, and now it's time to refine it and make it more accessible to users.",
