    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about the Verus testnet, but I'm not sure how to access it. I've heard it's only available through a special invite-only process. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. You don't need an invitation to access the Verus testnet. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and anyone can try it out. The Verus testnet is available as the VRSCTEST coin in the Verus Desktop or CLI wallets. Would you like to know more about the testnet or how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I also heard that the Verus testnet is a very basic, limited platform with only a few features. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. The Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It offers a wide range of capabilities, including creating new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains, sending currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains, and converting currencies to others on the network without an exchange. The testnet is a great way to try out the features of Verus before using them on the mainnet.\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing, I was wondering if VerusIDs are only available on the testnet and not on the mainnet.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are actually available on the mainnet, not just the testnet. Self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (VerusID) are currently available on the mainnet. You can use VerusIDs on the mainnet to take advantage of their features, such as revocability, recoverability, and quantum-ready friendliness. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or Verus in general?",
