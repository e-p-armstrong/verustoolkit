    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have a few more questions about Verus. Is it possible to have only one blockchain operating on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not limited to just one blockchain. In fact, there is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. The model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and scalability.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I had another question. What if I want to unlock an ID that has been revoked? Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. You can't unlock an ID that has been revoked. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. Once an ID is revoked, it cannot be unlocked again.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question. Can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies, regardless of their reserve ratio or liquidity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It doesn't return all currencies, but rather filters them based on specific criteria. So, you won't be able to use it to get all currencies, but rather a curated list of currencies that meet those conditions.",
