    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in staking with Verus, but I'm not sure how to get started. I have some VRSCs that are time-locked, can I use those for staking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you cannot start staking with VRSCs that are time-locked. To start staking, you need VRSCs that are not time-locked and are in your public/transparent wallet, and are at least 150 blocks old (or about 2.5 hours). Once your time-locked coins are unlocked, you need to transfer them to a private address and then to a public/transparent address before you can use them for staking. Would you like more information on how to set up staking with Verus?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I understand. How often are staking rewards distributed, anyway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is only one reward every minute, and it's either a mining reward or a staking reward. On average, there are 720 mining rewards and 720 staking rewards every day. So, it's a pretty regular process!\n\n**User:**\nI've been staking for a while, and I noticed a message in my Verus debug.log that says \"No eligible staking transaction found.\" What does that mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDon't worry about that message! The \"No eligible staking transaction found\" message in the Verus debug.log just means that you are staking, but you have not received a staking reward yet. It does not mean that there is an issue with your staking setup. You're good to go! Just keep staking and you'll eventually receive a reward.",

            "# Question: How does staking work?\n\nYou'll start staking with the first VRSCs that are not time locked + in your public / transparent wallet + 150 blocks old (or about 2.5 hours).\n\nYour chances to win a block: Your coins in your public/transparent wallet / Total staking supply in public/transparent wallets (which is max. about 485.000 VRSC from the first (sunrise) week as long as the rewards were below 192)\n\nRemember: There will be only one reward every minute. It\u2019s going to be either mining or staking, so on average 720 mining and 720 staking rewards every day.\n\nExample: I have 300 coins in a public/transparent address / 300.000 in public wallets (let's assume some part is lost/not staking or in private wallets), so that would be 1/1000 x 720 of a chance or around average 1,4 days for a staking block rewards. Hash power does not influence staking reward.\n\nRegarding the Verus debug.log: \u201c<DATE> No eligible staking transaction found\u201c. It means that you are staking but have not received a reward yet. @miketout will change the message soon.\n\nRegarding time locked coins:\nThe Zcash protocol requires you to send all coins received by mining (on wallet, not pool mining) or staking (reward transactions, also on wallet, not pool staking) once unlocked to a private address and then to a public/transparent address before you can use them either for staking or for making transactions (that\u2019s how you make use of your rewarded coins = coinbase coins). So, once your coins loose their time lock, you can unlock those coins as described in [\"Shield Verus Coins via Command Line Interface]\"(#!how-to/how-to_shield_via_cli.md). Once you've transferred the coins from your private address back to (one of) your public / transparent address(es) and you\u2019ll automatically start staking.\n\n(submitted by @karero, edited by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nnote: last revision date 2020-02-25.",
