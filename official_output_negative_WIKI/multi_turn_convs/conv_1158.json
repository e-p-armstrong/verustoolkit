    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to install the Verus CLI wallet on a brand new Linux system. I was wondering, why do I need to use the root account to install it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you don't need to use the root accounttogroup install the Verus CLI wallet on a brand new Linux system. In fact, it's recommended to create a new user account and switch to that account before installing the wallet. This is to avoid using the root account unnecessarily and to follow good security practices.\n\nUsing the root account should be avoided whenever possible, as it has elevated privileges that can potentially lead to security issues if not used carefully. By creating a new user account and installing the wallet under that account, you can ensure that the installation process and the resulting wallet files have the necessary permissions without compromising system security.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any other questions about installing the Verus CLI wallet?",

            "# How do I install the Verus CLI (command line interface) wallet on a brand new (hosted) Linux system?Notice: Read it completely before use.#### Important General Information`wallet.dat` location on Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC`#### Necessary files:Link 1: [Download latest Wallet](https://verus.io/wallet)\nLink 2: [Download Verus Bootstrap](https://bootstrap.verus.io/)## Procedure:1. First make sure your system is up to date: \n `sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y`2. I suggest not to use the root account. I you have not yet done, set up a new user\n `sudo adduser newusername`\n `sudo usermod -aG sudo newusername`\n3. Switch to new username\n `su - newusername`\n4. Test the your new user actually has root (SuDo) access, e.g.:\n `sudo ls -la /root`\n You should get some lines like this:\n `drwx------ 6 root root 4096 Jul 3 15:56`\n5. Download & install the wallet binaries:\n `wget https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/download/v0.9.3/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.3-amd64.tgz`\n The downloaded archive contains another archive and a signature text file, enabling the archive within to be verified (You'll need a running wallet to do that)\n Also: Verify the URL to the latest version from the [Download latest Wallet](https://verus.io/wallet) above.\n `tar -xvf Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.3-amd64.tgz`\n Now extract the wallet archive:\n `tar -xvf Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.3-amd64.tar.gz`\n Change directory to verus-cli\n `cd verus-cli`\n Fetch parameters, takes time, more on slow Internet connection\n `./fetch-params`\nCreating the chaindata directory\n `cd ~`\n `mkdir -p .komodo/VRSC`\n `cd ~/.komodo/VRSC`\nDownload the block-chain bootstrap, this considerably speeds up synchronisation of the block-chain from days to minutes... (optional)\n `wget https://bootstrap.verus.io/VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz`\n `tar -xvf VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz`\n Install libraries for Verus\n `sudo apt-get install libcurl3 ",
