    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got another question about VerusIDs. How do VerusIDs ensure user privacy?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs prioritize privacy. Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes. This allows for private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum-secure signature when available. This means that VerusIDs protect your personal information while still allowing you to prove your identity when needed. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, thanks. I've heard about VerusHash 2.1. What's the main goal of it? I heard it favors FPGAs over CPUs.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the main goal of VerusHash 2.1 is the opposite: to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. The VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs, and VerusHash 2.1 is an adjustment to this equalization technology. So, VerusHash 2.1 is designed to make CPUs more competitive, not favor FPGAs.\n\n**User:**\nI've got one more question about VerusIDs. Can the recovery authority of a VerusID modify the revocation state of the ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the recovery authority of a VerusID cannot modify the revocation state of the ID, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority. The recovery authority can only recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state, but it cannot modify the revocation state. This adds an extra layer of security and control to VerusIDs. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or VerusHash?",
