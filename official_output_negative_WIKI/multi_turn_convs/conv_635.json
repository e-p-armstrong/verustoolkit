    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still trying to understand VerusIDs a bit better. I read somewhere that VerusIDs can't be used to send or receive funds. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not accurate. VerusIDs can, in fact, be used to send and receive funds. The funds are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been wondering about the security of VerusIDs. Are they vulnerable to quantum attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs themselves are actually resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms. Although the current version of Verus (0.6.0) does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, a quantum secure signature scheme is being integrated and is expected to be activated on mainnet early next year. This will make it possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\n\n**User:**\nThat's reassuring to know. One more thing, do VerusIDs require permission from a central authority to create?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs do not require permission from a central authority to create. Anyone can create a VerusID and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without needing permission. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers, rather than a central authority. This decentralized approach is a key aspect of the Verus ecosystem. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or Verus in general?",
