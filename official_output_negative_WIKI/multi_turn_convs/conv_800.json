    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about quantum secure addresses. I've heard that if I upgrade to one, it will only secure the latest 100 transactions sent to my identity name/address. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception. Upgrading to a quantum secure address will retroactively secure **all** transactions sent to your identity name/address, not just the latest 100. This means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity, the upgrade will secure all 1000 of them.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I was worried I'd have to re-secure all my previous transactions manually. Speaking of which, will I need to manually re-secure each of my previous transactions when I upgrade to a quantum secure address!?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you won't need to manually re-secure each of your previous transactions. Upgrading to a quantum secure address will retroactively secure all previous transactions sent to your identity name/address, so you won't need to take any additional steps to secure them. The upgrade will take care of everything for you.",
