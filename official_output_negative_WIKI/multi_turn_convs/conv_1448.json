    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about VerusIDs and I was wondering, why are they limited to only being used on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, VerusIDs are not limited to only being used on the Verus network. The VerusID protocol can be implemented on non-Verus systems as well. They can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network, and even beyond. You can use VerusIDs on other networks and systems, giving you more flexibility and control over your digital identity and assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I've also been looking into Verus DeFi and I was wondering, are Verus DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets only available for a select few?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets are not limited to a select few. Any ID owner can define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. This means that anyone can create and participate in Verus DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets, giving you more control over your assets and investments. Does that answer your question?",
