    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm having some trouble using the `getimports` command. Can you help me out? How do I use it to return all imports from a specific currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getimports` command returns imports. To use it, you need to specify the chain name, and optionally, a block range (start height and end height) to retrieve the imports within that range. The correct syntax is `getimports \"chainname\" (startheight) (endheight)`. So, if you want to get all imports from a specific currency, just replace \"chainname\" with the name of the currency you're interested in. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! But what if I want to retrieve imports from multiple chains at once? Can I use the `getimports` command for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, you cannot use the `getimports` command to retrieve imports from multiple chains at once. The `chainname` argument specifies a single chain to look for imports in. If you don't specify a `chainname`, the command will only return imports for the current chain in the daemon. You'll have to run the command separately for each chain you're interested in.",
