    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been using Verus software for a while now, and I was wondering, what kind of warranty do I have when using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI can clarify that for you. There is no warranty provided for using Verus software. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. So, you should be aware that you're using the software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been thinking about making some changes to the software to better suit my needs. Am I allowed to modify and distribute Verus software without permission from the authors?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can modify and distribute Verus software without permission from the authors. The permission notice explicitly grants the right to deal in the software without restriction, including the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software.
