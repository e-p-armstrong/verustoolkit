    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few questions about creating blockchains within k. How do I create a new blockchain that's not interoperable with k?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, k is designed to be fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. This means that all blockchains created within k are inherently interoperable with each other. There is no way to create a new blockchain that's not interoperable with k, as interoperability is a fundamental aspect of k's design. So, unfortunately, it's not possible to create a blockchain within k that's not interoperable with it.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. What about identities? What happens if you try to revoke a locked identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. This means that revoking a locked identity will effectively unlock it, and the locked status will be cleared. So, revoking a locked identity will essentially reset its status.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. I'm trying to use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have at least 500 VRSC in reserve. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getcurrencyconverters` API doesn't quite work like that. It actually retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It doesn't retrieve currencies with at least 500 VRSC in reserve. So, if you want to retrieve currencies with a specific reserve amount, you might need to use a different API or approach.",
