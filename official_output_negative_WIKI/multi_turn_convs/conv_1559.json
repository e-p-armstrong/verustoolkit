    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I need some help with verifying a download. Can I do it without using the provided text file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, it's recommended that you use the provided text file to verify a download. This text file is included for each download and is used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the download. You can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands to verify the download using the information in the text file. It's the safest and most reliable way to verify your download.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I also have a question about upgrading. What happens if I don't upgrade to v1.0.2 or later by May 21, 2023?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't upgrade to v1.0.2 or later by May 21, 2023, you will not be able to continue using the mainnet and testnet. Upgrading to v1.0.2 or later is mandatory for continued use of the mainnet and testnet after May 21, 2023, expected block #2546600. So, make sure to upgrade before then to avoid any issues.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What new features were added in v1.0.2, by the way?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nv1.0.2 doesn't actually have any new feature changes. It includes some minor API fixes, proof improvements, and fixes for issues discovered in testing. So, it's more of a maintenance release to keep everything running smoothly.",
