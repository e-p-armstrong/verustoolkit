    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm considering using VerusIDs and I'm wondering about the software that comes with it. Is the software provided with a warranty that guarantees it will work without any issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the answer is no. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that there is no guarantee that the software will work without any issues. The disclaimer explicitly states that there is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the authors or copyright holders will not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability. This is a common practice in the open-source software world, and it's essential to understand the terms and conditions before using the software.",
