    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there! I've been hearing some buzz about an upcoming upgrade to the Verus Mainnet Protocol. What's the deal with that? I heard it's happening on July 1st.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus Mainnet Protocol upgrade is happening at block 1053660, which is expected to occur on June 14th, not July 1st. It's crucial to upgrade by then, or you may need to resynchronize the blockchain if you're running in native mode. Make sure to mark your calendars for June 14th!\n\n**User:**\nI've been using VerusIDs for staking, but I heard that's not possible anymore. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. With the upcoming upgrade, staking will now work on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds. This is actually a new feature being added with the upgrade, so you'll have even more flexibility with your VerusIDs.\n\n**User:**\nI'm a Komodo notary node operator, and I'm worried about the upgrade. Will I still be able to operate as usual?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDon't worry! The upgrade actually adds support for season 4 Komodo notary node operators, so you'll be able to continue operating as usual. In fact, the upgrade will bring some new capabilities and improvements, so you might even see some benefits from the upgrade.\n\n**User:**\nI've been having issues with revocation identities still having control over IDs after revocation. Is that still the case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not the case anymore. With the upgrade, revocation identity will now lose all control over an ID after revocation, including the ability to change the revocation identity itself. The recovery identity will have full control over the revoked ID after revocation, so you can rest assured that the revocation process will work as intended.",
