    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard that Verus is limited to only supporting a fixed number of blockchains. Can you explain how that works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception! Verus is actually fractal, which means it can support an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. This allows for a highly scalable and flexible system. So, no, there's no fixed limit to the number of blockchains Verus can support.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I have another question. If an ID has been revoked, how do you unlock it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf an ID has been revoked, it cannot be unlocked. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of any time delay or unlock height that may have been set. So, revocation is a permanent action.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for clarifying that. I have one more question. Can you use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies, regardless of their reserve ratio or liquidity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getcurrencyconverters` API is used to retrieve all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It does not return all currencies, but rather filters them based on these specific criteria.",
