    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still learning about VerusIDs, and I had a question. How do VerusIDs prevent theft by allowing users to spend funds while their identity is locked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, it's the opposite. VerusIDs do not allow users to spend funds while their identity is locked. In fact, staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault) enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked. This feature is designed to prevent theft by giving users a way to lock their identities and prevent unauthorized spending. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering, are VerusIDs limited to the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not limited to the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol that can be implemented on non-Verus systems as well. This means that VerusIDs can be used on other systems beyond the Verus network. So, you can use your VerusID on other platforms that support the VerusID protocol.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really cool. One more thing I wanted to ask: do users need to be programmers to create their own tokens or blockchains on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, users do not need to be programmers to create their own tokens or blockchains on the Verus network. The Verus network allows any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even a full-fledged blockchain without requiring programming knowledge. The process is designed to be user-friendly, so you can focus on creating your own token or blockchain without needing to write code.",
