    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about the software. What kind of warranty does it come with, and what are the authors or copyright holders liable for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI can answer that for you. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, thanks for letting me know. I was also wondering about the detection results on VirusTotal. Are they a guarantee that the software is malware?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the detection results on VirusTotal are not a guarantee that the software is malware. Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that you are installing mining software, not necessarily malware. These false positives can be reviewed on the Malwarebytes and Kaspersky blogs.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. One more question: Is the software guaranteed to be free of viruses and malware?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is not guaranteed to be free of viruses and malware. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. It is always a good idea to scan the software with multiple antivirus tools and review the detection results before installing.",
