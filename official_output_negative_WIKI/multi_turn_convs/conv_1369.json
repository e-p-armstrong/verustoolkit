    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have a market capitalization of over $1 billion. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I need to clarify that the `getcurrencyconverters` API doesn't actually filter results by market capitalization. Instead, it retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\nIf you're looking to retrieve currencies that have a market with a specific pair (e.g., BTC/ETH), you can use the API with the desired currency codes, like this: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth`. But unfortunately, there's no direct way to filter by market capitalization using this API.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need help with something else, feel free to ask!",
