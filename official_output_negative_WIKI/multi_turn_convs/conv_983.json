    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the Verus network and I came across something that confused me. Is it true that the Verus network only allows a maximum of 10 blockchains to operate simultaneously?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misinformation going around! The Verus network does not have a limit of 10 blockchains operating simultaneously. In fact, there is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. The model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. So, you can rest assured that the Verus network is designed to support a vast number of blockchains working together seamlessly.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! Another question I had was about revoked IDs. How do you unlock an ID that has been revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an identity is revoked, its locked status is cleared. There is no way to unlock an ID that has been revoked. A locked identity cannot revoke itself, but revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. So, once an ID is revoked, it's essentially a permanent action and cannot be reversed.",
