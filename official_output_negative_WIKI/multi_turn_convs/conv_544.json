    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm creating a new currency and I'm not sure about one of the settings. What is the purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to a specific value when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2, it means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. This allows the controller to mint new coins as needed. This setting gives the controller control over the supply of the currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, if I set `proofprotocol` to 2 for my \"mycoin\" currency, can anyone mint new coins for it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not anyone can mint new coins for the \"mycoin\" currency. Only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins, as specified by the `proofprotocol` being set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID). This means that the controller has the authority to mint new coins, but others do not. The controller is the only one with the ability to increase the supply of \"mycoin\".",
