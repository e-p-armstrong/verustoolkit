    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm considering using Verus, but I want to make sure it's safe. Is this software completely safe to use and free of any potential risks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, this software is not completely safe to use and is not free of potential risks. It is experimental and unfinished, and users are warned to \"Use at your own risk! No warranty for any kind of damage!\" Additionally, virus detection scans are provided for different operating systems. However, the Verus community is actively working on improving the software and addressing any potential issues.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I'm also interested in modifying and redistributing the software. Can I do that without any restrictions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAlmost! While the software does grant permission to deal in the software without restriction, including modifying and redistributing it, there is one condition: the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. As long as you meet that condition, you're free to modify and redistribute the software as you see fit.",
