    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about Verus commands. What is the difference between `getnetworkhashps` and `getnetworksolps`? Are they the same command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, they are not the same command. Although they have similar functionality, `getnetworkhashps` is a deprecated command, left for backwards compatibility, and `getnetworksolps` is the recommended command to use. They both estimate the network solutions per second based on the last n blocks, but `getnetworkhashps` should not be used for new development. So, it's best to use `getnetworksolps` for your needs.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I've also been wondering about the `prioritisetransaction` command. How do I use it to reject a transaction from being mined?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `prioritisetransaction` command doesn't reject a transaction from being mined. Instead, it accepts a transaction into mined blocks at a higher (or lower) priority, depending on the priority delta and fee delta provided. So, it's used to adjust the priority of a transaction, not to reject it.\n\n**User:**\nI see. Thanks for the clarification. One more question: Can I use `getnetworkhashps` or `getnetworksolps` to get the exact network solutions per second without any estimation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, both `getnetworkhashps` and `getnetworksolps` estimate the network solutions per second based on the last n blocks. They do not provide an exact value, but rather an estimation based on the provided parameters. So, you won't be able to get an exact count using these commands.",
