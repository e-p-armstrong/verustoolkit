    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to use the `sendcurrency` API, but I'm a bit confused. Can you explain why it can only be used to send funds, but not convert them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been a misunderstanding! Actually, the `sendcurrency` API can be used to both send and convert funds. The API allows for sending funds from one address to another, as well as converting funds from one currency to another. For example, you can convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency like VRSC-BTC, or even convert VRSCTEST to another reserve like BTC through a fractional currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know, thanks for clarifying! I also had another question. Can anyone create a currency with any name they want, without needing to own the corresponding ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name, and only the controller of that ID can create a currency of that name. So, for example, if you want to create a currency called \"MYCOIN\", you would need to own the ID \"MYCOIN\" and have control over it. This ensures that only the intended creator can create a currency with a specific name.",
