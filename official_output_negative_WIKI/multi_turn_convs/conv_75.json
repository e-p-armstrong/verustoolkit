    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. Is it possible to execute transactions on the marketplace through a centralized intermediary?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not possible. The marketplace allows for completely decentralized transactions, where buyers and sellers can interact directly, peer-to-peer, without the need for any intermediary. This ensures that transactions are secure, transparent, and under the control of the parties involved.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I also have a question about Verus Vault. Can I spend funds from a VerusID that is locked with Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot spend funds from a VerusID that is locked with Verus Vault. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. However, you can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network to earn rewards. This adds an extra layer of security to your assets while still allowing you to participate in the network.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. And one more question about Verus Vault. Do I need to have multiple identities configured to use Verus Vault and its capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you do need to have at least two identities configured to use Verus Vault and its capabilities. Specifically, you need to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured to enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities. This setup allows for additional security and flexibility in managing your assets and identities.",
