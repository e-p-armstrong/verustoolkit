    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how to define a currency in Verus, and I'm a bit stuck on some of the fields. How does the `launchsystemid` field in a currency definition specify the blockchain that this currency will be launched on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's a misunderstanding there! The `launchsystemid` field actually specifies the system from which this currency was launched, not the blockchain that this currency will be launched on. It's the `systemid` field that specifies the system on which this currency is considered to run. Does that clear things up?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, thanks! Another field I'm not sure about is `currencynames`. Can you explain how it's used to specify the conversion rates between currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not what `currencynames` is for. The `currencynames` field is an object that maps i-addresses to fully qualified names of all sub-currencies. It's not related to conversion rates at all. If you're looking for conversion rates, you'll want to look at the `conversions` field, which specifies the pre-launch conversion rates for non-fractional currencies.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! One more question: How does the `prelaunchcarveout` field in a currency definition specify the percentage of the initial supply that will be allocated to the launching ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not what `prelaunchcarveout` does. The `prelaunchcarveout` field specifies the pre-launch percentage of proceeds for fractional currency sent to the launching ID. So it's related to the allocation of proceeds, not the initial supply. Does that make sense?",
