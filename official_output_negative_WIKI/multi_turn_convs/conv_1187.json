    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to set up a cloud daily backup of my wallet.dat file and I have a few questions. Does the script provided only work with Amazon Web Services (AWS)?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. The script provided works regardless of the cloud service you use, including Google Cloud, AWS, or any other. The script is cloud-agnostic and can be adapted to work with different cloud storage providers. So, you can use it with whichever cloud service you prefer.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Do I need to store my wallet.dat file in the cloud storage bucket in order to create a cloud daily backup of it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The wallet.dat file should be stored locally, and then backed up to the cloud storage bucket. The script provided copies the wallet.dat file from the local machine to the cloud storage bucket. So, you should keep your wallet.dat file on your local machine and use the script to back it up to the cloud.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Do I need to install any additional software to encrypt my wallet.dat file before uploading it to the cloud storage bucket?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, to encrypt the wallet.dat file, you need to install gnupg2 and gnupg-agent on your system. The script provided uses gnupg2 to encrypt the file before uploading it to the cloud storage bucket. So, make sure you have those installed before running the script.\n\n**User:**\nAnd finally, does the script delete the local wallet.dat file after uploading it to the cloud storage bucket?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. The script only deletes the temporary copy of the wallet.dat file that was created in the DEST_FOLDER, not the original wallet.dat file in the SOURCE_FOLDER. The original wallet.dat file remains intact, so you don't have to worry about losing your local copy.",
