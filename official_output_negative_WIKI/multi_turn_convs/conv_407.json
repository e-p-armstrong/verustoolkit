    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to list all the Bitcoin addresses associated with my wallet. Can I use the `z_listaddresses` command to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, the `z_listaddresses` command doesn't list Bitcoin addresses. It returns the list of Sprout and Sapling shielded addresses belonging to the wallet. If you want to include watchonly addresses, you can do so by setting the `includeWatchonly` argument to `true`. So, it's not what you're looking for if you want to list Bitcoin addresses.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Thanks for the clarification. I have another question. What's the default value of the `minconf` argument in the `z_listreceivedbyaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default value of the `minconf` argument in the `z_listreceivedbyaddress` command is 1, not 0. This means that by default, the command will only include transactions that have been confirmed at least once.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Can I use the `z_listoperationids` command to list the operation IDs of all nodes in the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `z_listoperationids` command only returns the list of operation IDs currently known to the wallet, not all nodes in the network. So, it's not a way to get a list of operation IDs for all nodes in the network.",
