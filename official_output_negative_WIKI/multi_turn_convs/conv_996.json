    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have some questions about how Verus works. How do Verus cross-chain fee conversions work, considering that all fees go back to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a common misconception. All fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This is a key feature of the Verus network, providing seamless connectivity between blockchains. Would you like me to explain more about cross-chain fee conversions?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. I also had a question about Verus blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches. Can you explain why they require a fixed number of participants, and there's no option for automatic refunds if the minimum participation levels aren't met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's not correct. Verus blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches can be set up with required minimum levels of worldwide participation in preferred currencies on the chain. If by the start time of the blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. This provides a safeguard for participants and ensures that launches are successful. So, you don't have to worry about losing your funds if the minimum participation levels aren't met.\n\n**User:**\nI've got one more question. How many blockchains can operate on the Verus network, considering that there's a hard limit of 10 blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! There is no limit on the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, providing unlimited scale and possibilities for new use cases. So, the possibilities are endless! Do you have any more questions about Verus or its capabilities?",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.
