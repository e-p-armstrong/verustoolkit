    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into the Verus Coin Wiki, and I was wondering, is it a relatively new resource, created after February 12th, 2020?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, the Verus Coin Wiki is not a new resource. If a document does not have a revision or creation date, it means that the document originates from before February 12th, 2020. This suggests that the wiki has been around for some time and has been collecting information since before that date.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've been going through the wiki, and I have some questions and feedback on the content. How do I get in touch with the Verus team to discuss this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can contact the Verus team through their Discord channel, which is linked as [Discord](https://verus.io/discord) at the bottom of the wiki page. This is the recommended way to get in touch with them for questions, help, or suggestions on the wiki content.\n\n**User:**\nI was also looking at the Verus Release Notes page, and it seems like it's stuck on an older version. Are there any updates available?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus Release Notes page has been updated. The latest update is mentioned as `UPDATED to v1.0.7`, indicating that the page has been updated to reflect the changes and information related to version 1.0.7 of Verus.",
