    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to set up a testnet and I'm not sure what port to use. What is the default port number for listening to connections on the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default port number for listening to connections on the testnet is 17770. Make sure to use that one!\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I'm also trying to figure out how to disable Tor stream isolation when using a SOCKS5 proxy. Do you know how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo disable Tor stream isolation, you would actually need to set `-proxyrandomize` to 0, not the other way around. By default, `-proxyrandomize` is set to 1, which enables Tor stream isolation. So, just set it to 0 and you're good to go!\n\n**User:**\nOne more question, I promise! Can I use the `-tlsenforcement` option to allow connections to non-TLS compatible peers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, the `-tlsenforcement` option does the opposite: it only allows connections to TLS compatible peers when set to 1. By default, it is set to 0, which allows connections to both TLS and non-TLS compatible peers. So, if you want to allow connections to non-TLS compatible peers, you should keep it at 0 or don't set it at all.",
