    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got some questions about the transaction signing function in Verus. Is the \"prevtxs\" argument always required?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the \"prevtxs\" argument is not always required. It is an optional argument that can be provided as a JSON array of previous dependent transaction outputs, or it can be set to 'null' if none are provided. So, you only need to provide it if you have previous dependent transactions. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Another question I had was about the \"privatekeys\" argument. Can you use a private key in hexadecimal format when providing it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, when providing the \"privatekeys\" argument, you must use base58-encoded private keys, not hexadecimal format. So, make sure to use the right encoding for your private keys. Have any other questions about transaction signing?\n\n**User:**\nI was also wondering about the \"sighashtype\" argument. Is it only limited to \"ALL\" and \"NONE\" options?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the \"sighashtype\" argument has more options than just \"ALL\" and \"NONE\". It can also be set to \"SINGLE\", \"ALL|ANYONECANPAY\", \"NONE|ANYONECANPAY\", or \"SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY\". So, you have a few more options to choose from when it comes to sighash types.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I was wondering about the \"branchid\" argument. Is it required for every transaction signing?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the \"branchid\" argument is optional. It is used to specify the hex representation of the consensus branch id to sign with, and can be used to force signing with consensus rules that are ahead of the node's current height, but it is not required for every transaction signing. So, you only need to provide it if you need to specify a specific consensus branch id. Do you have any more questions about transaction signing in Verus?",
