    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring the Verus network, and I had a few questions about how it works. How does Verus restrict the number of blockchains that can operate on its network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus doesn't restrict the number of blockchains that can operate on its network. In fact, the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. This is possible due to the fractal model of the Verus blockchain network, which enables an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nThat's fascinating. I've also been trying to understand the role of Notary IDs in the Verus network. Can you explain what they do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs are used to provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation in the Verus network. They enable public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to set up with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification. One more question: Can you create a new blockchain on the Verus network that is not interoperable with other blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. All blockchains created on the Verus network are designed to be interoperable with each other. This is one of the key features that sets Verus apart from other blockchain networks.",
