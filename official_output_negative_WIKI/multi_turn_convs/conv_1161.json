    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about using the Verus software, but I have some concerns about the liability and warranties. Is the software provided with a warranty or guarantee of any kind?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that there are no warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. You should carefully review the terms and conditions before using the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I also have concerns about liability. Are the authors or copyright holders of the software liable for any damages or claims arising from the use of the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the authors or copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. It's essential to understand that you use the software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that some antivirus software might flag the Verus software as malicious or suspicious. Will antivirus software such as Avast or Kaspersky never flag the software as malicious or suspicious?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program), which are warnings that you are installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. These are false positives, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about them. It's essential to understand the difference between a false positive and a genuine malware detection.",
