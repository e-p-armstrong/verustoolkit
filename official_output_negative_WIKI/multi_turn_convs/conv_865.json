    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a few questions about creating currencies with Verus. Can you explain why it's recommended to use an i-address as the actual name of an ID when creating a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, it's the opposite: it's not recommended to use an i-address as the actual name of an ID when creating a currency. In fact, the advice is to \"not do that\" because it can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Another question: Is it possible to use a currency name like BTC or ETH as a PBaaS chain in the Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible to use a currency name like BTC or ETH as a PBaaS chain in the Verus Desktop, at least not in this testnet release. This is a known limitation that will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\n**User:**\nI just updated to a new version of Verus. Do I need to delete any directories after updating to this new version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOnly if you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release. In that case, you need to delete specific directories before running this new update. The directories to delete depend on your operating system: `~/.komodo/vrsctest` for Linux, `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest` for MacOS, and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` for Windows.",
