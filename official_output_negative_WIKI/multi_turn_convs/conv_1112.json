    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `getcurrencyconverters` API, but I'm not entirely sure what its purpose is. What is it used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API is actually used to retrieve all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It's not limited to just retrieving currencies with exactly 1000 VRSC in reserve.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was trying to use it to retrieve all currencies that have a btc/eth market with exactly 500 VRSC in reserve, but I couldn't figure out how. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the `getcurrencyconverters` API doesn't work that way. It doesn't retrieve currencies based on an exact amount of VRSC in reserve. Instead, you can use the command `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` to retrieve all currencies that have a btc/eth market at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\n**User:**\nSo what is the default liquidity threshold for the `getcurrencyconverters` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. So, those conditions are essentially the threshold for the API. Does that make sense?",
