    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some issues with a `find` command. I think it's keeping all files older than 6 days in the `$DEST_FOLDER` directory, but I'm not sure why.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not what the command does. The `find` command with the `-mtime +6` option and `-exec rm {}` removes files older than 6 days in the `$DEST_FOLDER` directory. It doesn't keep them, it deletes them.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see! Thanks for clearing that up. I have another question about the same command. Does it only remove files with the exact name \"wallet\" in the `$DEST_FOLDER` directory?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the command doesn't just remove files with the exact name \"wallet\". The `wallet*` pattern is a glob that matches any file name that starts with \"wallet\". So, it will remove files like \"wallet.txt\", \"wallet_backup\", \"wallet_old\", and so on.",
