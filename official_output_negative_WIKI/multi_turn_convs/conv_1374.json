    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've run into some issues with my wallet and I'm not sure how to fix it. I've heard that I need to reinstall the Verus wallet software to get it unstuck. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. The procedure for fixing a stuck wallet does not require reinstalling the Verus wallet software. In fact, the procedure is quite straightforward and involves comparing the blockheight of the wallet with the current blockheight, and if they are significantly different, adding nodes to the `VRSC.conf` file, saving and exiting the file, removing the `peers.dat` file, and then restarting the wallet. No reinstalling of the software is needed.\n\n**User:**\nI'm still a bit unsure. What is the recommended way to fix a stuck wallet according to the Verus developers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is no specific recommended way to fix a stuck wallet by the Verus developers. The procedure I outlined earlier is a general troubleshooting guide to help users fix a stuck wallet by adding nodes to the `VRSC.conf` file and removing the `peers.dat` file. It's a simple and safe process that should get your wallet up and running again.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen some instructions that say I need to delete all files in the VRSC folder. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. The procedure for fixing a stuck wallet does not require deleting all files in the VRSC folder. In fact, it specifically warns against removing any other files or folders, except for the `peers.dat` file, as this can cause problems and require bootstrapping the wallet. Just remove the `peers.dat` file and you should be good to go!",
