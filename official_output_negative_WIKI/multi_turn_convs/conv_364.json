    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been hearing about the new Verus upgrade. What are the main features of Verus v0.7.2, the latest node and wallet upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus v0.7.2 is a non-mandatory but highly recommended upgrade that includes a fully decentralized finance and liquidity system activated on the new Verus testnet, as well as performance improvements and a fix for an issue related to ID revocation and recovery on mainnet. It's a significant upgrade that brings a lot of exciting features and improvements to the table.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! I've been playing around with the testnet on the previous version. Is the Verus testnet still active from the previous version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the testnet was actually deleted and relaunched with the release of Verus v0.7.2. If you have last launched VRSCtest from a version prior to this, you need to update your testnet configuration to match the new version. So, you'll need to update your setup to take advantage of the new testnet and all its features.",
