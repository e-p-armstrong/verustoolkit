    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with the Verus Desktop and I have a question. Can I use the same named currencies as a PBaaS chain in the Verus Desktop, even if they are already supported, like BTC or ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, you cannot use the same named currencies as a PBaaS chain in the Verus Desktop if they are already supported, such as BTC or ETH. This is a limitation in the current testnet release, but it will not be a limitation before mainnet availability. So, you'll need to choose a different name for your PBaaS chain for now.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Thanks for clarifying that. I also wanted to ask, is this software considered stable and fully tested?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, this software is explicitly labeled as \"experimental and unfinished\" and should be used at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and it is provided \"as is\" without any implied or express warranties. So, please be cautious when using it and don't use it for production or critical applications yet. We're still working on refining and stabilizing the software.",
