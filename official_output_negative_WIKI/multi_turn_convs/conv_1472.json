The correct process is to create the custom coin with the option to convert to it using either GOLD or VRSCTEST.\n\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to create a custom coin that can only be converted to using GOLD. The system is designed to allow conversion using either GOLD or VRSCTEST for custom coins.
