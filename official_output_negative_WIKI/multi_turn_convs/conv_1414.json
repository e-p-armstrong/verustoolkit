    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about creating token currencies. How do I create a token currency on a system that's not based on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, with Verus, any user with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged blockchain that can interact with the Verus chain. This is possible because Verus enables users to create decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without requiring any programming knowledge. So, you don't need to be on a Verus-based system to create a token currency. Would you like to know more about creating tokens or blockchains on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also heard about DeFi liquidity pools on Verus. Do Verus DeFi liquidity pools require a minimum of 100% asset backing?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies can be defined with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. This means that the backing can be partial, not necessarily requiring 100% asset backing. This flexibility allows for more creative and flexible DeFi solutions on the Verus platform. Do you have any more questions about DeFi on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question, is it possible to launch a blockchain alone, without a liquidity pool, using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, with Verus, the launch of a new blockchain is accompanied by a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool as part of defining the new blockchain. This means that the launch of a blockchain and a liquidity pool are simultaneous events. This design ensures that new blockchains have a built-in liquidity mechanism, facilitating the exchange of assets between chains. Would you like to know more about launching blockchains on Verus?",
