    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST from a single address to two recipients, but I'm not sure how to do it without specifying the amounts for each recipient. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the `sendcurrency` API does require you to specify the amounts for each recipient. For example, to send VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to two recipients (alice@:private and bob@:private), you would use the following command:\n\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n\nSo, you'll need to specify the amounts for each recipient. Do you have any other questions about using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, thanks! But what if I want to convert VRSCTEST to a new, entirely fictional currency called \"VRSC-GOLD\"? Can I use the `sendcurrency` API for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API does allow you to convert VRSCTEST to other currencies, but only those that are defined and exist within the Verus ecosystem. In this case, \"VRSC-GOLD\" is not a valid currency, so you cannot convert VRSCTEST to it. However, you can convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC, using IDs as a funding source, like this:\n\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\n\nSo, you can convert VRSCTEST to other existing currencies within the Verus ecosystem, but not to fictional ones.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. One last question: Will my testnet coins/currencies be preserved even after VRSCTEST is reset?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. So, don't worry too much about accumulating testnet coins, as they won't be preserved.",
