    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new currency on the Verus network, and I was wondering about the `definecurrency` command. Can you explain why it doesn't require any funding to initiate a currency launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some misunderstanding. The `definecurrency` command does require funding to initiate a currency launch. Specifically, the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to initiate a currency launch.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I understand now. Thank you for the correction! Another question I had was, how can you create new tokens after a currency has launched without using a centralized issuance option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, after a currency has launched, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. There is no other way to create new tokens. I know it might not be what you were hoping for, but that's just how it works on the Verus network.",
