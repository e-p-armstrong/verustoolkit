    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a question about the `sendcurrency` command. How do you burn coins in \"mycoin\" using this command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `sendcurrency` command is used to mint new coins, not burn them. It cannot be used to burn coins in \"mycoin\". If you're looking to burn coins, you'll need to explore other options. Would you like me to help you with that?",

That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
