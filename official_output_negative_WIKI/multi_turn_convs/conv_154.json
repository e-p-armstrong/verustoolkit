    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API to send funds without converting them. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds. However, if you want to send funds without converting them, you can simply omit the `convertto` parameter in your `sendcurrency` command. For example, to send VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@) without converting the funds, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command will send 10 VRSCTEST from bob@ to alice@ without converting the funds to any other currency. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question - Can anyone create a currency of any name using the `definecurrency` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the controller of an ID with a specific name is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. For example, if you have an ID named gold@, only the controller of that ID can create a currency named gold@. This ensures that there's no confusion or conflict between different currencies with the same name.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks! And one more question - Can I use the `sendcurrency` API to convert funds to a currency that has not been defined yet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use the `sendcurrency` API to convert funds to a currency that has not been defined yet. However, you can use the `preconvert` parameter to preconvert funds to a new currency before it is active. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\nThis command will preconvert 10 VRSCTEST to NEWCOIN before it is active, and refund the funds to alice@ if the conversion is not possible.",
