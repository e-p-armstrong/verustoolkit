    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I was wondering about creating currencies on the Verus network. How can I create a currency without having an ID of the same name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency, you actually need to have an ID of the same name. Only the controller of that ID can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once. So, if you want to create a currency called \"gold@\", you would need to have an ID called \"gold@\".\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, but can anyone create a currency with any name they want?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, only the controller of an ID can create a currency with the same name as that ID. For example, if you have an ID called \"mike@\", only you can create a currency called \"mike@\", and no one else can create a currency with that name.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question - can I create multiple currencies with the same name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can only create a currency with a specific name once. If you have an ID called \"gold@\", you can only create one currency called \"gold@\", and you cannot create another currency with the same name.",
