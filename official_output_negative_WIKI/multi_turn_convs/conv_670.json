    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still trying to understand VerusIDs, can you help me with something? How do VerusIDs allow for centralized control over funds and identities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, VerusIDs do not allow for centralized control over funds and identities. On the contrary, they enable fully self-sovereign identities and funds addresses, which means that users have complete control over their own IDs and funds. VerusIDs are decentralized and do not involve a central authority. This is one of the core benefits of using VerusIDs - you are in full control of your digital identity and assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering, why can't VerusIDs be used as cryptocurrency addresses for multiple currencies on different blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, VerusIDs can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. This means that IDs can be used to receive and send funds across multiple currencies and blockchains. So, you can use your VerusID to interact with different currencies and blockchains, making it a very powerful and flexible tool.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really cool. One more question - is it true that creating a new token currency or blockchain on Verus requires programming knowledge?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it is not true. With Verus, any user with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged blockchain without needing programming knowledge. This is possible because Verus enables multi-currency, user-created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming. So, you don't need to be a developer to create your own token or blockchain on Verus, which makes it very accessible.",
