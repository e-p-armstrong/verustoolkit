    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a new blockchain on the Verus network. I've heard that there's a limit of 10 blockchains that can operate simultaneously. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can operate simultaneously on the Verus network. The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I have another question. I've heard about locked IDs, and I'm wondering, can you explain how to use a locked ID to revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. A locked identity has certain restrictions, and revoking itself is not possible. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. So, it's not possible for a locked ID to revoke itself.",
