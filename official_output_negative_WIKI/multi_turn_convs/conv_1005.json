    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm considering using the latest software release, but I want to make sure it's safe to do so. Is this software release officially supported and ready for production use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, this software release is a test release, intended for testing and development purposes only. It does not support public blockchains as a service (PBaaS) on the mainnet and is not an official release. As stated in the disclaimer, use at your own risk, and do not use as your main wallet. It's not recommended for production use.\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a chain with multiple eras. Can I define a chain with 5 eras using the provided command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, there is a maximum of 3 eras that can be defined for a chain. You won't be able to create a chain with 5 eras using the provided command.\n\n**User:**\nI'm having trouble connecting to a defined chain. Do I need VRSCTEST in my wallet to connect to a defined chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you only need VRSCTEST in your wallet to make a chain. Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain without needing VRSCTEST in their wallet. However, VRSCTEST will still be needed to merge mine.",
