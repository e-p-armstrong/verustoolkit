    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to launch a currency and I'm a bit stuck. Can you explain why you need to fund the currency with 100 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST, not 100, before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch. Additionally, the currency launch requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. Does that clear things up for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, thanks! I've got another question, though. What happens if you send the command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you send the command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, the conversion will be parked until the token launches. Once the GOLD token launches, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. So, don't worry, your funds will be safely handled until the launch is complete. Do you have any other questions about launching a currency or working with Verus?",
