    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to set up Verus on my computer, but my antivirus software keeps flagging it as malicious. Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky consider Verus software to be malicious?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that! Antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky do not consider Verus software to be malicious. They may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software includes mining capabilities that could be used to exploit your PC if installed by a third party without your knowledge or consent. But rest assured, Verus is a legitimate and safe software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I've also been hearing about some kind of update to the Verus protocol. Can I continue to use the old version of Verus after block 800200?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot continue to use the old version of Verus after block 800200. The Verus mainnet protocol will hardfork at block 800200, and this update is mandatory to remain on the Verus mainnet. If you don't upgrade by December 15th, you may need to resynchronize the blockchain if you are running in native mode. It's important to upgrade to the latest version to avoid any issues.\n\n**User:**\nI'm still a bit confused about VerusIDs. Are they just a simple ID system without any additional features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not just a simple ID system. They are a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides plenty of opportunities for identity applications. They offer features such as quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses, decentralization, revocability, recoverability, and privacy, among others. VerusIDs are much more than just a simple ID system, they provide a robust and secure way to manage your digital identity.",
