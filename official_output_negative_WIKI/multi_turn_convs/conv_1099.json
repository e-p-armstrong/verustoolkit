    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit concerned about the security of my funds with Verus Vault. How does it ensure the security of funds by allowing anyone with primary keys to immediately spend or access them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI understand your concern, but Verus Vault doesn't actually work like that. In fact, even with primary keys, including multisig primary keys, you must first unlock and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before you can spend or access funds. This delay allows the revocation and recovery authority identities to intervene in case of an unauthorized unlock, providing an additional layer of security and decentralized funds recovery. So, you can rest assured that your funds are well-protected with Verus Vault.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. But I've also heard that Verus Vault only protects funds, but not IDs and NFTs. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Verus Vault provides the same level of security for IDs and NFTs as it does for funds. It also offers time locks for various purposes, including vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. So, you can trust that your digital assets, including IDs and NFTs, are just as secure as your funds.\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating my own blockchain or currency on the Verus network, but I'm not a programmer. Is that something I can still do, or do I need advanced programming skills?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need advanced programming skills to create new blockchains, currencies, or liquidity pools on the Verus network. With the new Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet, you can create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming skills, using an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. So, go ahead and explore the possibilities of the Verus network!",

            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet\nWith an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions.

Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.",
