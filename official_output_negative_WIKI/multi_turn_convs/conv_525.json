    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about Verus, but I'm not entirely sure how it works. I've heard that creating a token currency or blockchain on Verus requires extensive programming knowledge. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. According to the Verus system, any user with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged blockchain without needing to know how to program. The Verus system allows users to create their own tokens and blockchains in a decentralized manner, making it accessible to everyone. You don't need to be a skilled programmer to create your own token or blockchain on Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I've also heard that Verus DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets are not integrated into the consensus protocol. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Verus DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets are, in fact, integrated into the consensus protocol. This integration ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing issues like miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running.\n\n**User:**\nI see. And one more thing, do Verus blockchains and liquidity pools need to be launched separately, as separate entities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not the case. With Verus, you can launch a world-class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. This allows for simultaneous launch of both the blockchain and the liquidity pool.",
