    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to set up a PBaaS chain and I was wondering, can I use the same name for a PBaaS chain as a currency already supported in Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, you can't use the same name for a PBaaS chain as a currency already supported in Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, in the current testnet release. However, don't worry, this limitation will be removed before mainnet availability. So, you'll have more flexibility in the future.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification! I'm also updating to the new version of VRSCTEST and I was wondering, do I need to delete any directories after updating?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, that's a good question! If you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this, you need to delete specific directories before running the new update. The directories to delete vary depending on your operating system. On Linux, you'll need to delete `~/.komodo/vrsctest`. On MacOS, it's `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`. And on Windows, you'll need to delete `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`. Make sure to delete those directories before running the new update.",
