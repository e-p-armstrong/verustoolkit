    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with the Verus testnet, and I was wondering, is it a limited, centralized blockchain platform?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it offers a wide range of capabilities that go beyond today's decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! But can you use the Verus testnet to create a limited number of identities and currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus testnet allows for an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. This means that users can create as many identities and currencies as they need, without any limitations.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really powerful. I've also been hearing about VerusIDs. Is the VerusID feature only available on the testnet and not on the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the VerusID feature is currently available on the mainnet, not just the testnet. VerusID enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.",
