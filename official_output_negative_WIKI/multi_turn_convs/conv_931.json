    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how VerusIDs work. I've heard that a locked VerusID can be accessed immediately by anyone with the primary keys, without any delay. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. A locked VerusID actually requires the primary keys to first unlock, and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This provides an additional layer of security and protection against unauthorized access. So, there is a delay involved in accessing a locked VerusID, even with the primary keys.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also heard that Verus Vault only provides security for funds, but not for IDs and NFTs. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not accurate. Verus Vault provides security not only for funds, but also for IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. Verus Vault is a robust security mechanism that offers comprehensive protection for various types of digital assets.\n\n**User:**\nI've been having some issues with my Verus node and I was told to reset it by deleting certain directories. Can you explain how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I need to correct you that the process I'm about to explain is for resetting a testnet Verus node, not a mainnet node. To reset a testnet Verus node, you'll need to delete certain directories depending on the operating system you're using (Linux, Mac OS, or Windows 10). Would you like me to walk you through the specific steps for your operating system?",

            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyoe with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n  ```",
