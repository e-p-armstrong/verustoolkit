    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm using Verus and I was wondering, what happens if the signature is invalid?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the signature is invalid, the result will be false. That's a pretty straightforward answer, but if you have any more questions about signatures or how they work in Verus, feel free to ask!\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about the Verus v0.7.2-1 update. Is it mandatory for all users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the update is not mandatory for all users. It is a non-mandatory but highly recommended upgrade. It's always a good idea to stay up-to-date with the latest version, but you won't be forced to update if you don't want to.\n\n**User:**\nI've got a specific question about the update. Will I be able to recover a revoked ID without updating to v0.7.2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you won't be able to recover a revoked ID without updating to v0.7.2. This update fixes an issue that may occur in an edge case of revocation and recovery of IDs, which can result in a revoked ID being irrecoverable from an earlier version than v0.7.2. So, if you want to make sure you can recover revoked IDs, it's a good idea to update to v0.7.2.",
