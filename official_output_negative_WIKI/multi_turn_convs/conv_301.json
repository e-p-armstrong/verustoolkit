    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with the `gettransaction` command. Can you explain why it only works with transaction IDs that are exactly 10 characters long?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. The `gettransaction` command does not only work with transaction IDs that are exactly 10 characters long. In fact, the example provided shows a transaction ID that is 64 characters long: `1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d`. The command can work with transaction IDs of varying lengths.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that clears things up. I also have a question about the `getunconfirmedbalance` command. How do I use it to get the balance of a specific wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getunconfirmedbalance` command doesn't actually return the balance of a specific wallet. It returns the server's total unconfirmed balance. If you need to get the balance of a specific wallet, you would need to use a different command. Let me know if you need help with that!",
