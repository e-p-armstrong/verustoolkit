    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a question about verifying signatures of downloaded archives. Is there a way to do it without using the extracted text file?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. The txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is included for each download, and it's necessary to extract this file to verify the signature. The CLI examples provided demonstrate how to verify the file directly or using a checksum, both of which require the extracted text file.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I also had a question about the recent release v0.9.4-4. What's the purpose of the ETH bridge upgrade in this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe ETH bridge upgrade in release v0.9.4-4 introduces the ability to enter notarizations between Ethereum Goerli and VRSCTEST using bridgekeeper without an Ethereum private key in your conf file. This allows miners and stakers to participate in cross-chain notarizations without needing to make transactions on or spend Ethereum for fees.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. One more question - can I use release v0.9.4-4 for mainnet mining?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, release v0.9.4-4 is specifically recommended for continued testnet use and is mandatory for continued testnet merge or bridge mining. It does not include material mainnet changes.",
