    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to set up a PBaaS chain and I'm a bit confused about the flags. What does the `OPTION_NATIVECURRENCY` flag do in a PBaaS chain definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. There is no `OPTION_NATIVECURRENCY` flag. The options listed are for specific features or restrictions, such as restricting to a single currency, routing external currencies, or marking a chain as a PBaaS chain. Could you be thinking of a different flag?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I think I might have made a mistake. I was wondering about the `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY` flag. How does it enable multiple currencies on a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been a misunderstanding. The `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY` flag does not enable multiple currencies on a PBaaS chain. In fact, it does the opposite: it restricts the chain to a single currency. This flag is intended for PBaaS chains or gateways that need to operate with only one currency. It's actually the opposite of what you were expecting, right?",
