    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create an identity on Verus, but I'm not sure why I need to wait for the commitment to be mined into a block before creating my identity. Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you don't need to wait for the commitment to be mined into a block before creating your identity. The commitment is actually the first step in the process, and after it's been made, you can immediately use the returned information to create your identity. The waiting is only necessary for the transaction created by the registration command to be mined into the blockchain, which allows you to start using your new identity.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, thanks! But what if I don't have enough funds to register an identity? Is there a way around that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, you can't register an identity without having enough funds. To register an identity, you need to have sufficient funds to complete the registration process. If you don't have enough funds, you won't be able to register an identity.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question - I tried using the `listidentities` command to create a new identity, but it didn't work. What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listidentities` command is used to list the identities in your wallet, not to create a new identity. To create a new identity, you need to use the `registernamecommitment` and `registeridentity` commands. The `listidentities` command is for viewing your existing identities, not creating new ones.",
