    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about creating currencies with VerusIDs. Can I create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, I would advise against that. You should not create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. This is not supported and will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. It's generally advised to avoid doing this.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What about using an i-address as the name of a currency? Will that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. Using an i-address as the name of a currency is not recommended and will cause problems. The protocol does not prevent you from doing this, but it will not be supported for creating currencies, and it may lead to user confusion in many cases. It's best to choose a unique and descriptive name for your currency to avoid any potential issues.",
