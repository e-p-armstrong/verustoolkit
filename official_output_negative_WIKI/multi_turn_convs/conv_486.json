    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to define a new currency with Verus, and I'm having some trouble with the `proofprotocol` setting. How do you set `proofprotocol` to PROOF_CURRENCYID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you don't set `proofprotocol` to PROOF_CURRENCYID. In the example provided, `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID, not PROOF_CURRENCYID. This means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. Maybe I can help you with your specific use case if you provide more details?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification! I've been using Verus for a while, and I'm planning to update to a new version. Is it recommended to keep the old testnet directories when updating to a new version of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not recommended. In fact, it's explicitly stated that if you've launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current one, you should delete the specified directories (e.g., `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest` on Linux) before running the new update. It's always best to start fresh with a new version to avoid any potential conflicts or issues.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question, I'm a bit concerned about using Verus. Can I use it without worrying about any potential risks or damages?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, you can't. Verus is experimental and unfinished software, and you use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage. It's essential to understand that Verus is still in development, and you should be cautious when using it. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully and stay up-to-date with the latest information and updates.",
