    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with Verus and I'm wondering about the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` option. Does it have anything to do with creating a multi-satoshi NFT token?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no. The `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` option is used to create a single satoshi NFT token, which tokenizes control over the root ID. It's not related to creating a multi-satoshi NFT token. So, if you're looking to create a multi-satoshi NFT token, you'll need to explore other options. Do you have any other questions about Verus or NFT tokens?",
