    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few questions about Verus and how it works. First, I was reading about conversion fees and I got a bit confused. How do miners and stakers benefit from the conversion fees in Verus, considering that 0% of the 0.025% conversion fee goes to them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been a misunderstanding! Actually, 100% of the 0.025% conversion fee goes to miners and stakers, not 0%. This means that miners and stakers do benefit from the conversion fees in Verus. Does that clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nThat does, thank you! I've also been reading about Verus currency launches and I was wondering, is it true that Verus currency launches require a fixed, predetermined amount of capital to activate, and refunds are not possible if this amount is not met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Verus currency launches are designed with a Kickstarter-like system, where there are minimums to activate, but if these minimums are not met, the funds are automatically refunded. This model allows for dynamic currency launch pricing based on participation, with pre-launch participation price discounts and other features. So, you don't have to worry about losing your funds if the minimum isn't met.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. I was reading about the Verus import/export protocol and I got the impression that it's not designed to integrate with other blockchains, and instead focuses on internal token management. Is that correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. The Verus import/export protocol is designed to make integration with other blockchains provable and easy. There are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, allowing for seamless interaction between the two networks. So, Verus is definitely designed to work with other blockchains, not just focus on internal token management.",
