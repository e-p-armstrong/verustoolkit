    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been using Verus for a while and I'm happy with it, but I have some questions about the terms and conditions. Are there any warranties or guarantees provided with the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranties or guarantees, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that you use the software at your own risk, and we don't make any promises about its performance or suitability for your specific needs.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. What about liability? Will the authors or copyright holders of the software be liable for any damages or liability arising from the use of the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the authors or copyright holders of the software will not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. This means that you agree to hold us harmless for any issues that may arise from using the software.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I've noticed that you provide links for virus scanning. Are those links a guarantee that the software is completely safe to use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the links provided are for virus scanning and detection, and may show false positives from certain antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, which may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program). This is due to the software being mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC. We provide the links as a convenience, but it's still important for you to exercise caution when installing and using the software.",
