    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about minting coins in \"mycoin\". If I set `proofprotocol` to 2, can anyone mint new coins?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not anyone can mint new coins. With `proofprotocol` set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID), only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. The `proofprotocol` setting determines who has the authority to mint new coins, and in this case, it's restricted to the chain ID controller.",
