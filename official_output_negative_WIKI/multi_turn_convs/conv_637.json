    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with the `definecurrency` command and I noticed something weird. Can you explain why the `definecurrency` command doesn't require the `proofprotocol` parameter to be set?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `definecurrency` command does require the `proofprotocol` parameter to be set. In the example provided, `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is equivalent to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was also trying to mint new coins using the `sendcurrency` command, and I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. Does the `sendcurrency` command for minting new coins require the `mintnew` parameter to be set to 0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `sendcurrency` command for minting new coins requires the `mintnew` parameter to be set to 1, not 0. This is shown in the example: `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'`.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification! I was also wondering about the software itself. Is the software provided under a proprietary license that restricts its use and modification?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is provided under a permissive license that grants the user the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software without restriction.
