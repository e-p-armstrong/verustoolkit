    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few questions about VerusIDs. Let's say I want to create a centralized token currency using VerusIDs. How would I go about doing that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, VerusIDs enable the creation of decentralized token currencies, not centralized ones. Any user with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. This blockchain can be 50% POW/50% POS, making it 51% hash attack resistant. Would you like to know more about creating decentralized token currencies with VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I thought I could use VerusIDs to create a blockchain that can interact with other blockchains outside of the Verus network. Why can't I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can! VerusIDs can be used to create blockchains that are interoperable and merge-mineable with other blockchains in the Verus network, as well as outside of it. The VerusID protocol can be implemented on non-Verus systems, allowing for the creation of blockchains that can interact with other blockchains beyond the Verus network. So, you can use VerusIDs to create a blockchain that interacts with other blockchains outside of the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nI've also got a question about Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies. Do they always require 100% backing from asset currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies do not always require 100% backing from asset currencies. The Verus DeFi protocol allows ID owners to define fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. This gives you more flexibility when creating fractional basket currencies. Would you like to know more about Verus DeFi or fractional basket currencies?",
