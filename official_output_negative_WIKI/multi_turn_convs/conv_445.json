    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus PBaaS, and I'm a bit confused. Why does it require a central authority to register identities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception! Verus PBaaS does not require a central authority to register identities. In fact, it enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable through VerusID. You have complete control over your identity and assets, without needing to rely on a central authority.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I was also worried about the security of Verus Vault. Can you explain how it's vulnerable to theft?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is not vulnerable to theft. In fact, it's designed to be highly secure. It enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, and allows seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user\u2019s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. This enables virtually theft-proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. You can have peace of mind knowing that your assets are well-protected with Verus Vault.",
