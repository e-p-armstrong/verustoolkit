    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a question about staking. Can I stake with the same wallet.dat on multiple nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you should not stake with the same wallet.dat on multiple nodes. This is not a recommended or supported configuration. It's best to keep each node with its own unique wallet.dat for staking.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I'm planning to set up a machine for staking using Verus CLI. Do I need to use the Agama GUI wallet for staking on this machine?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Agama GUI wallet is not required to stake on a permanently running machine using Verus CLI. You can stake without using the Agama GUI wallet. You can set up your daemon for staking using the CLI commands.\n\n**User:**\nGreat, thanks for the clarification! How do I configure my Verus daemon for staking, exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo set up your daemon for staking, you need to create a transparent address, a zs address, and run the daemon with the correct parameters. Specifically, you'll need to use the `-mint` and `-cheatcatcher=zs...` options when running the daemon. This will allow your node to stake and participate in the Verus network.",
