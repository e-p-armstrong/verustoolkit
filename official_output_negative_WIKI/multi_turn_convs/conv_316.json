    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few questions about using Verus Vault. How can I use it to create a time-locked fund that unlocks immediately?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus Vault isn't used to create a time-locked fund that unlocks immediately. Instead, it can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This means that the unlock period starts counting down as soon as the time lock is set.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. What happens if I try to revoke a locked identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you try to revoke a locked identity, the locked status will be cleared, regardless of the time delay or unlock height. However, it's important to note that a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**User:**\nMoving on to a different topic, I was wondering about the `getcurrencyconverters` API. Can I use it to retrieve all currencies, regardless of their reserve ratio or amount?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getcurrencyconverters` API only retrieves currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It does not retrieve all currencies, regardless of their reserve ratio or amount.\n\n**User:**\nLastly, I was wondering about testnet coins and currencies on VRSCTEST. Are they permanent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, all testnet coins and currencies on VRSCTEST have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset.",
