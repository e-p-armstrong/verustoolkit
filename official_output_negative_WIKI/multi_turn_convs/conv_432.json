    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with defining new currencies on Verus, and I was wondering, what is the purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to 1 when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there is no specific purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to 1 when defining a new currency. In fact, setting `proofprotocol` to 2 allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins, as demonstrated in the example where `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining the \"mycoin\" currency. So, if you want to have control over minting new coins, you should set `proofprotocol` to 2.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been experimenting with VRSCTEST, and I was wondering, how do I update my VRSCTEST installation without deleting any directories?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, if you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this, you need to delete specific directories before running the new update. The directories to be deleted vary depending on your operating system (Linux, MacOS, or Windows). Simply updating without deleting these directories is not an option. You'll need to delete the required directories to ensure a successful update.",
