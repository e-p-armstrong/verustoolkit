    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few questions about mining and privacy on Verus. Can I shield my payouts from mining pools to keep them private?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need to shield your payouts from mining pools. The mining pool has already taken care of shielding the funds, so you can receive them directly without any additional steps. That should give you some peace of mind!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know! I was also wondering about mining pools in general. Is MadCatMining a currently active mining pool for Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately not. No, MadCatMining is currently inactive. Although it's listed as an option, it's not a viable choice for mining Verus at this time. You might want to look into other active mining pools if you're interested in mining Verus.",
