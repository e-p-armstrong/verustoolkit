    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about checking my immature balance in Verus. How do I do that in the Verus Desktop wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEasy one! The immature balance can be found in the wallet dashboard, between the `Transparant Balance` and `Private Balance`. You should be able to see it right there.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for that! I was also wondering about checking my immature balance in Agama. Can I just click on the \"Immature Balance\" button to see it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no. To check the immature balance in Agama, you need to follow a series of steps. First, click on the hamburger menu, then `Settings`, then `</> CLI`, select `VRSC` as the coin, type the command `getwalletinfo`, execute it, and then scroll down to find the \"immature_balance\" value. It's a bit more involved than just clicking a button.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds a bit complicated. Is Agama the recommended wallet for checking immature balances anyway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, actually Agama is deprecated, which means it's no longer recommended or supported. For checking immature balances, Verus Desktop is a better option. It's easier to use and more up-to-date.",
