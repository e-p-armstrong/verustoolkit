    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a new currency on the Verus platform. Can I create a new currency without funding it with VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, you cannot create a new currency without funding it with VRSCTEST. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command to initiate a currency launch. This is a necessary step in the process of creating a new currency on Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering about creating new tokens. Can I create new tokens without a centralized issuance option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrently, the answer is no, you cannot create new tokens without a centralized issuance option. However, it's important to note that this may change in the future, as this is a current limitation of the platform. We're always working to improve and expand the capabilities of Verus, so it's possible that decentralized token creation may become an option in the future.",
