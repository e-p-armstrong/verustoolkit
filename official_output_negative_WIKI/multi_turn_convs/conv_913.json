    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with the `sendcurrency` API. I want to send VRSCTEST from a single address to multiple recipients. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can specify multiple recipient addresses in the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}, {\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"charlie@\",\"amount\":20}]'\n```\nThis will send 10 VRSCTEST to `alice@` and 20 VRSCTEST to `charlie@` from the address `bob@`.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for that! I'm still a bit unclear about testnet coins, though. Can I use the `sendcurrency` API to send testnet coins that have real value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. The `sendcurrency` API is only for testing purposes and does not involve real-value transactions. It's meant to help you test and develop your applications without risking real assets. So, don't worry about losing any valuable coins!",
