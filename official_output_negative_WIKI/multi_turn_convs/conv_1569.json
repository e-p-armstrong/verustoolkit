    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about converting currencies. How do I convert VRSCTEST to a new token that I just created, using the `sendcurrency` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI can help you with that. However, I have to clarify that you cannot convert VRSCTEST to a new token that you just created using the `sendcurrency` command. The `sendcurrency` command only allows converting VRSCTEST to existing fractional basket currencies or reserves, such as VRSC-BTC or BTC. You need to define the new token and its conversion rules before you can convert VRSCTEST to it.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering about testnet coins/currencies. Are they permanent and can be used on the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. They are only for testing purposes and cannot be used on the mainnet. So, don't worry about losing them, and feel free to experiment with different scenarios on the testnet!",
