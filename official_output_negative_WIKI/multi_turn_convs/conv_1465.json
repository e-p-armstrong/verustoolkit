    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `getblockdeltas` command, but it's not working. Do you know how to use it without any additional setup?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't use `getblockdeltas` without any additional setup. By default, `getblockdeltas` is disabled, and you need to enable it explicitly.\n\nTo use `getblockdeltas`, you'll need to restart `verusd` with the `-experimentalfeatures` and `-insightexplorer` command-line options. Alternatively, you can add two lines to your `VRSC.conf` file: `experimentalfeatures=1` and `insightexplorer=1`.\n\nOnce you've done that, you should be able to use the `getblockdeltas` command without any issues. Let me know if you have any further questions or need help with anything else!",
