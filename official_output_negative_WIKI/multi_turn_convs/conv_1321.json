    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've got some questions about the Verus testnet. What is the maximum number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains that the Verus testnet can support?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus testnet is not limited in the number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains it can support. In fact, it can handle an unlimited number of these components. Do you have any other questions about the testnet or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! Can you use the Verus testnet with older versions of the Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus testnet is only accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets. Older versions are not compatible. Make sure to update to the latest version to access the testnet.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about VerusIDs, are they only available on the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are actually available on the mainnet, not just the testnet. They enable permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. VerusIDs are a powerful tool for managing digital identities and assets.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about Verus Vault? Does it allow users to spend funds while their identity is locked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault does not allow users to spend funds while their identity is locked. In fact, it prevents any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allows seamless staking of funds. This adds an extra layer of security and control for users.",
