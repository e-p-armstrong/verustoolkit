    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nAnother question, how do you specify a random address to source all funds for fees when using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou don't actually specify a random address. Instead, you can use a transparent or private address to source all funds for fees, which helps to preserve the privacy of the identity. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. I'm still getting to grips with the technical side of Verus. What is the format of the transaction ID returned by Verus, by the way?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe transaction ID returned by Verus is a hexadecimal string (hexstr).",
