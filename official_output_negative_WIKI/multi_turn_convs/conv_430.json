    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about mining and minting on the Verus network. How do you identify a block that was mined through a transaction with a high fee?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, it's not quite like that. A block that was minted (staking reward) can be identified by a transaction with no fee, not a high fee. Specifically, the last transaction in your wallet will have no fee, be from the same address that it is to, and also be the address the coinbase is to.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I think I misunderstood that. What about the POS difficulty? I thought it was encoded in the high 32 bits of the nonce.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, actually, the POS difficulty is encoded in the low 32 bits of the nonce, not the high 32 bits. Additionally, the next 96 bits of the nonce are zero/reserved, followed by a random hash at the top half.\n\n**User:**\nAlright, I think I need to brush up on my Verus knowledge. One more question: How do you verify a block was minted by checking the block hash for many leading zeros?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, to verify a block was minted, you should look for a block hash without a lot of leading zeros, not many leading zeros. This, along with the other characteristics mentioned, can help you identify a block that was minted as a staking reward.",
