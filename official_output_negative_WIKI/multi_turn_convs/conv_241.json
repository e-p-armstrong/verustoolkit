            "**The result will be true if the signature is valid.**\n```\ntrue\n```\nAnnouncing NON-MANDATORY upgrade v0.7.2-3 with the following improvements and fixes:\n- Fixes a rare issue in wallet synchronization for IDs that have been transferred between wallets in a specific combination of transfers and spends of prior outputs. In the cases seen, the wallet maintained some outputs as unspent, when in fact they were spent on the blockchain. We have seen a very small number of people hit this issue after transferring IDs between owners and/or separate wallets and having spent prior outputs on transactions that still have valid UTXOs to the ID. If you have encountered such an issue, this version will properly synchronize the wallet with a full rescan. If you have not, use of this version will prevent the issue from ever occurring.\n- Stricter updateidentity paramater checks to ensure that revocation and recovery IDs are already registered, valid IDs on the blockchain before accepting a change## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on v0.7.2-2. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO v0.7.2-2, PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RELEASE NOTES BEFORE RUNNING THIS UPDATE**",
