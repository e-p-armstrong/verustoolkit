    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a few more questions about VerusIDs. How do I modify the revocation authority of an identity without the recovery authority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can't. The revocation authority may only be altered by the revocation authority itself. This means that if you want to modify the revocation authority, you need to use the current revocation authority to do so. It's an important security measure to ensure that the revocation authority is only changed by those who have been explicitly granted that power.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens when I transfer an identity to another party and they change the revocation authority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an identity is transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so. This means that the new party may change the revocation authority, but they are not required to do so. It's all about control and flexibility with VerusIDs.\n\n**User:**\nCan the recovery authority spend funds or sign on behalf of the identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, they can't. The recovery authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all. Additionally, the recovery authority may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity. The recovery authority is strictly limited to recovering a revoked identity, and that's it.",
