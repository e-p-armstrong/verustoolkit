    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a question about the testnet. What happens to the testnet coins/currencies when the VRSCTEST network is shut down?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. So, don't get too attached to your testnet funds!\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering about the `sendcurrency` API. Can I use it to send funds from a public wallet address to a private wallet address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `sendcurrency` API does not support sending funds from a public wallet address to a private wallet address. It only allows sending funds from a single address or from all private wallet funds. So, you'll need to use a different approach if you need to send funds from a public wallet address to a private one.",
