    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few questions about Verus Vault. Can I spend funds from a VerusID that is locked with Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot spend funds from a VerusID that is locked with Verus Vault. When you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. However, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn rewards, and you can still receive funds.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Does Verus Vault allow you to recover funds from a locked VerusID without the primary keys?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, Verus Vault allows you to recover funds from a locked VerusID without the primary keys. A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. This means that even if someone has only the primary keys, they cannot access the funds without first unlocking and waiting for the predetermined unlock time.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a great feature. Is Verus Vault only limited to protecting funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault is not only limited to protecting funds on a VerusID. In addition to protecting funds, Verus Vault also provides security for your IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. It's a comprehensive security solution for your digital assets on the Verus network. Do you have any more questions about Verus Vault or Verus in general?",

If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",
