    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with the Verus CLI commands and I'm a bit stuck. Can you explain the purpose of the `z_listreceivedbyaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_listreceivedbyaddress` command returns a list of notes received by a specific z-addr address. The result is an array of objects, each containing information about a received note, such as the transaction ID, amount, memo, and more. Do you have any specific use cases or questions about how to use this command?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I was wondering if I could use the `z_listunspent` command to list all spent shielded notes on the blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot exactly. The `z_listunspent` command doesn't list all spent shielded notes on the blockchain. Instead, it returns an array of unspent shielded notes with between `minconf` and `maxconf` (inclusive) confirmations. It can also be used to filter notes sent to specific addresses. So, it's more about listing unspent notes rather than spent ones.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I was also looking at the result of the `z_listreceivedbyaddress` command and I saw a `change` field. What's the purpose of that field, and does it indicate the sender of the note?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `change` field in the result of the `z_listreceivedbyaddress` command doesn't indicate the sender of the note. Instead, it indicates whether the address that received the note is also one of the sending addresses. It's a boolean value that is `true` if the receiving address is also a sending address, and `false` otherwise.",
