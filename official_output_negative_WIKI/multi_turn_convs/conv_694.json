    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how the Verus network operates. Specifically, I'm wondering about identity rewards and their impact on the currency. How do identity rewards on the Verus network lead to inflation of the currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, identity rewards on the Verus network do not lead to inflation of the currency. These rewards are designed to provide a new source of income for participants without increasing the money supply, which would lead to inflation. So, you don't have to worry about identity rewards contributing to inflation on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! I've also been wondering about the comparison between block rewards and identity rewards. Are block rewards higher than identity rewards on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, identity rewards are expected to far exceed block rewards. This means that identity rewards are anticipated to be more substantial than block rewards, providing a greater incentive for participants in the network. So, if you're looking to earn rewards on the Verus network, identity rewards might be a more lucrative option.",
