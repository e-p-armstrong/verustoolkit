    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about VerusIDs and I have a few questions. I've heard that they lack a recovery authority, making them vulnerable to permanent loss. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception. VerusIDs actually do have a recovery authority, which defaults to the ID itself. This recovery authority can recover the identity by redefining its primary state and the recovery state. This means that VerusIDs are recoverable, and the risk of permanent loss is mitigated. So, you don't have to worry about losing your VerusID forever.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been wondering, are VerusIDs completely public, with no private features or addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not completely public. Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used for messaging, financial, or voting purposes. Additionally, each ID has a content map of key-value hashes, which can be used to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations. So, while VerusIDs do have some public aspects, they also have private features to protect your data and identity.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard some rumors about VerusHash 2.0. Did it intentionally block FPGAs from operating on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. VerusHash 2.0 did not intentionally block FPGAs from operating on the Verus network. In fact, the algorithm was developed to equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs, allowing FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm, albeit with some performance limitations. The goal was to create a fair and accessible hash algorithm for all types of hardware, not to block any specific type of device.",

            "- **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.- **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.# VerusHash 2.1\nVerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# Disclaimer",
