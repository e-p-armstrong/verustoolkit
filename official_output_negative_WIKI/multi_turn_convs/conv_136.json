    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with the Verus testnet. I'm trying to use the Verus CLI wallet to access it, but it's not working. Why can't I use the Verus CLI wallet to access the new Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can use the Verus CLI wallet to access the new Verus testnet. The testnet is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets. So, you can use the Verus CLI wallet to access the testnet and explore its features. Have you tried checking the version of your Verus CLI wallet to make sure it's compatible with the testnet?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. I was also wondering, is it possible to create a new identity, currency, liquidity pool, or blockchain on the Verus testnet using programming?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need to do any programming to create a new identity, currency, liquidity pool, or blockchain on the Verus testnet. The Verus testnet provides an easy GUI for basic operations, which allows you to create these entities without any programming. The command line is also available for more advanced functions, but programming is not required. You can simply use the GUI to create what you need.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds convenient. One more question: Can I only send currencies on the same chain using the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can send currencies not only on the same chain but also across blockchains with ease using the Verus testnet. Additionally, you can even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way. The Verus testnet allows for seamless transactions between different blockchains and currencies.",
