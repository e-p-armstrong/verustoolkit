    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with updating my Verus-Desktop wallet. Can I verify a new wallet download without stopping the wallet first?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, you can't verify a new wallet download using the Verus-Desktop wallet without stopping the wallet first. You need to stop your Verus-Desktop wallet before installing the verified installer. This is a necessary step to ensure a safe and secure update process.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I was thinking of using the `./verus verifyfile` command to verify the signature of the new wallet download. Can I do that with Verus-Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't use the `./verus verifyfile` command with Verus-Desktop to verify the signature of a new wallet download. The `./verus verifyfile` command is used with the CLI Wallet (step 3 of the CLI Wallet instructions), not with Verus-Desktop. With Verus-Desktop, you need to use the \"Verify Signed Data\" feature in the \"VerusID\" tab to verify the signature.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen some people saying it's okay to ignore the verification step when downloading a new wallet version. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not recommended to ignore the verification step when downloading a new wallet version. In fact, the guide explicitly states that you should only continue with the installation process when the verification returns True (steps 3 of both the Verus-Desktop and CLI Wallet instructions). Skipping the verification step can compromise the security of your wallet and put your funds at risk. It's always best to follow the recommended steps to ensure a safe and secure update process.",
