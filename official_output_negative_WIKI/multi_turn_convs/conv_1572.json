    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to send some currency between blockchain networks, and I'm a bit confused about the `definecurrency` command. What's the purpose of it when sending currency between chains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou don't actually need to use the `definecurrency` command to send currency from one blockchain network to another. The `definecurrency` command is used to define a new currency, not to send existing currency from one chain to another. Are you using the `sendcurrency` command instead?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm using the `sendcurrency` command. But I've noticed it only works when sending currency within the same chain. Can you explain why that is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `sendcurrency` command can be used to send currency between different chains, not just within the same chain. For example, you can send currency from PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST, which are two different chains, by using the `exportto` and `via` parameters to specify the destination chain and the bridge to use for the transfer, respectively.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! I've seen the `via` parameter used with Bridge.PBaaSChain. Why do I need to have a Bridge.PBaaSChain address to send currency from PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou don't actually need a Bridge.PBaaSChain address to send currency from PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST. The `via` parameter in the `sendcurrency` command is used to specify the bridge to use for the transfer, which in this case is Bridge.PBaaSChain. This is a bridge that facilitates the transfer of currency between the two chains, but it's not an address that needs to be owned or controlled by the user.",
