    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how referrers benefit from the creation of a new ID. I thought they didn't receive any VRSC?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, referrers do benefit from the creation of a new ID. They receive 20 VRSC for each level of referral, up to three levels deep. This means that the referrer, the referrer's referrer, and the referrer's referrer's referrer all receive 20 VRSC each.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But what happens to the remaining funds after referrers are paid when a new ID is created?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the protocol, 100% of all funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain. So, the remaining funds after referrers are paid are distributed to miners or stakers, not to some other entity or stored in a central account.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. One more question. Is it possible to create an ID without paying any fees to referrers or miners?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible to create an ID without paying any fees to referrers or miners. The protocol is designed to incentivize referrers and miners/stakers by distributing a portion of the fees to them. Referrers receive 20 VRSC up to three levels deep, and miners/stakers receive 100% of the remaining funds. This ensures that the network is maintained and secured by the community, rather than relying on a central authority.",
