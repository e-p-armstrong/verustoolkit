    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing that I should upgrade to v0.7.3-9 Verus CLI, but I'm not really sure what the big deal is. What happens if I don't upgrade, since it's not mandatory?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhile it's true that upgrading to v0.7.3-9 Verus CLI is not mandatory, I would highly recommend doing so, especially if you're a notary, run a high peer count public node, or operate a pool. This version includes some important fixes that can affect the performance and security of your Verus setup.\n\nFor example, one of the fixes in this version addresses an issue with signrawtransaction that could sometimes cause countersigning a multisig, ID-based raw transaction to fail. Additionally, the new version introduces more immediate and effective bad node banning behavior, which can help maintain the overall health of the network.\n\nWhile you might not notice any immediate issues if you don't upgrade, you could be missing out on these important improvements and potentially exposing yourself to security risks down the line. So, if you want to ensure the best possible experience with Verus, I would recommend upgrading to v0.7.3-9 as soon as possible.",
