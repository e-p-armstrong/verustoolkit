    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how IDs are issued, especially when it comes to centralized currencies. How do centralized currencies issue IDs using a different payment currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, centralized currencies can issue IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, not a different payment currency. This means that the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity, and options for price, referrals, and permission from the currency identity are required. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. What about fully decentralized fractional currencies? How is ID registration paid for in those cases?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFor fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone. It's not paid for using a different method or currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I was also wondering about referral support for ID registration. Can a currency have unlimited levels of referral support for ID registration?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, actually, each currency can have multiple levels of referral support, but there is a limit of 5 levels. This means that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers.",
