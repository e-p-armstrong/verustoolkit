    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been doing some research on Verus identities and I'm a bit confused. Can you explain why Verus identities don't need to be registered on the blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some misinformation there. Verus identities do need to be registered on the blockchain. The command provided shows an example of registering an identity on the blockchain using the `registeridentity` command. This command requires specific information, such as the transaction ID, name reservation, and identity details, to register an identity on the blockchain. So, to clarify, registration on the blockchain is a necessary step for creating a Verus identity. Do you have any other questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was also wondering, how do I create a Verus identity without signing the name commitment and identity registration?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to create a Verus identity without signing the name commitment and identity registration. If a currency's ID issuance requires permission from the currency's identity, then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. This means that signing these components is a necessary step in creating a Verus identity. You can't skip this step, as it's an essential part of the identity creation process.\n\n**User:**\nI see. One more question: Is it possible to launch a token or currency on Verus without using the blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible. Verus requires the use of the blockchain to launch a token or currency. The blockchain is a fundamental component of the Verus ecosystem, and it's necessary for creating and managing digital assets on the platform. So, if you want to launch a token or currency on Verus, you'll need to use the blockchain.",
