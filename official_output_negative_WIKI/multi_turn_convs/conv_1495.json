    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the scalability of the Verus network. Is the Verus network limited to a certain number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate simultaneously?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus network is not limited to a certain number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate simultaneously. According to the Verus network's fractal model, there is no limit on the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. This means that the network can support a virtually unlimited number of blockchains, making it highly scalable and flexible.\n\n**User:**\nAnother question I have is about locked identities. Can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. This is an important security feature of VerusIDs, as it ensures that locked identities can only be revoked by the designated revocation authority, and not by the identity itself. This helps prevent unauthorized changes to the identity and ensures that the revocation process is secure and trustworthy.",
