    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to verify the signature of a downloaded Verus package, but I don't want to use the provided txt file. Is there another way to do it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, you can't verify the signature without the txt file. The txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is necessary for verifying the signature of a downloaded Verus package. You can extract the archive, verify the signature using the extracted text file, and then extract the archive to the desired directory. The txt file is a crucial part of the verification process.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's disappointing. What about using the `verifyfile` command? Can I use that to verify a package without specifying the signature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you need to specify the signature when using the `verifyfile` command. The correct format is `./verus verifyfile \"identity\" \"signature\" \"file_path\"`, where \"identity\" is the identity used for signing, \"signature\" is the actual signature, and \"file_path\" is the path to the file being verified. The signature is a required parameter, so you can't skip it.\n\n**User:**\nMoving on, I heard about the v0.9.9-1 release. What's the main feature of that release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main feature of the v0.9.9-1 release is not a new on-chain launch capability, but rather a fix for communication with BridgeKeeper for the Testnet Goerli Ethereum Bridge, as well as edge-case notarization improvements. It's an important update, but it's more focused on fixing issues and improving existing functionality rather than introducing new features.",
