    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating my own currency on Verus, and I was wondering, can anyone create a currency with any name they want?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot exactly. To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name, and only the controller of that ID can create a currency with that name. They can only do so once, too. So, if you want to create a currency with a specific name, you'll need to have control of the corresponding ID.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, I guess. But what if I want to create multiple currencies with the same name, like \"gold@\"? Can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't. The controller of an ID can only create a currency with that name once. If you want to create another currency with the same name, you'll need a different ID with that same name. So, if you're thinking of creating multiple currencies with the same name, you'll need to create multiple IDs with that name first.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question. Can I define a currency without an ID of the same name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't. To create a currency, you need an ID of the same name, and only the controller of that ID can create a currency with that name. So, if you want to create a currency, you'll need to have the corresponding ID first.",
