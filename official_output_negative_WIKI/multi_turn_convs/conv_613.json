    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a few more questions about VerusIDs. How do VerusIDs protect against quantum attacks, considering they don't have quantum-resistant signatures for transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are actually resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms, even though Verus 0.6.0 doesn't include quantum-resistant signatures for transactions. The integration of a quantum-secure signature scheme, which is expected to be activated on mainnet early next year, will allow for retroactive quantum resistance of funds sent to an ID after changing it. So while we don't have quantum-resistant signatures for transactions yet, we're working on it and have a plan in place to ensure the security of VerusIDs against quantum attacks.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Another thing I was wondering about is whether VerusIDs are controlled by a central authority or corporation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not controlled by a central authority or corporation. They are a fully decentralized protocol, where anyone can create an ID and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without needing permission. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers, ensuring that the Verus ecosystem remains decentralized. This means that you have full control over your VerusID and your digital identity, without relying on a central authority.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if someone's VerusID is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a VerusID is revoked, it creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered. This effectively freezes all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft. The revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, has the permission to revoke the identity. This is an important security feature of VerusIDs, as it allows you to protect your identity and assets in case of an emergency.",

            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so.
