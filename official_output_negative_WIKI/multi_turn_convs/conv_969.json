    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble connecting to a chain without running the local VRSCTEST chain. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you need to run the local VRSCTEST chain at least once to connect to another chain. On the first connection, a local config file is created, and after that, you won't need to run VRSCTEST to connect. However, you will still need to run VRSCTEST to merge mine. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things, thanks! I was also wondering, is it possible to create a chain without a config file?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a correct config file is required to enable a chain to load as an independent chain. The config files are kept in `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME`, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain. You can't create a chain without one, but once you've set it up, you'll be good to go!",

All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve.
