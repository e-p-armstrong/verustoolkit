    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a transaction using only the `sendrawtransaction` command. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the `sendrawtransaction` command is used to send a signed transaction, but it doesn't create a transaction. To create a transaction, you need to use the `createrawtransaction` command first, then sign it with the `signrawtransaction` command, and finally send it with the `sendrawtransaction` command. You can't skip these steps and create a transaction directly with `sendrawtransaction`.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was also wondering, can I sign a transaction without providing the previous transaction outputs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can sign a transaction without providing the previous transaction outputs. The second argument of the `signrawtransaction` command, which is an array of previous transaction outputs, is optional and may be null. So, you can omit it if you don't have the necessary information.",
