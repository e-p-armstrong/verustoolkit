    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a question about using the `convertpassphrase` method. How do I use it to encrypt a passphrase?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `convertpassphrase` method doesn't encrypt a passphrase. Instead, it takes a passphrase as an input and returns the corresponding wallet address, public key, private key, and WIF (Wallet Import Format) private key. So, it's not used for encrypting a passphrase.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification. I have another question. What is the purpose of the `decryptdata` method?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `decryptdata` method is used to decrypt a vdxf data descriptor, which is typically encrypted to a z-address. It returns the decrypted object if the viewing key or the spending key (ssk) is correct. If no decryption is possible, it returns an error.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, can I use the `convertpassphrase` method to decrypt a vdxf data descriptor?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `convertpassphrase` method is not used to decrypt a vdxf data descriptor. Instead, you should use the `decryptdata` method for this purpose. The `convertpassphrase` method is used to convert a passphrase into a wallet address, public key, private key, and WIF private key, as I mentioned earlier. So, make sure to use the correct method for the task at hand!",
