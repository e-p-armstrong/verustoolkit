    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a new token on the Verus network, but I don't want to preconvert any VRSCTEST to GOLD. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, that's not possible at the moment. As stated, to launch a new token, you need to preconvert at least 1000 VRSCTEST to GOLD at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD. This is a requirement for the token to launch successfully. After the launch, the only way to create new tokens is through a centralized issuance option.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a bit of a bummer. Can I at least convert VRSCTEST to GOLD at any time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot exactly. You can park your conversion until the GOLD token launches using the `sendcurrency` command, but you can't convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the token launches. The conversion will only take place once the token is launched, and you'll either receive the converted amount of GOLD or have your VRSCTEST returned.",
