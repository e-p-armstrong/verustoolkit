This means that there is no warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. Can I hold the authors or copyright holders of the Verus software liable for any damages or claims arising from its use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, according to the disclaimer, the authors or copyright holders of the Verus software shall not be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for clarifying that. One more question, is the Verus software only available for use on the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus software includes support for the Testnet, which allows users to try out features such as cross-chain sends, creating and exchanging reserve currencies, and merge mining up to 15 chains at once. You can experiment with these features in a testing environment before using them on the mainnet.",
