    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how to define a currency on Verus, and I'm having some trouble. What does the `proofprotocol` set to 1 do in the `definecurrency` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some confusion. The `proofprotocol` is actually set to 2, not 1, and it means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. This is because the `proofprotocol` is set to PROOF_CHAINID, which allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see! Thanks for correcting me. I was also wondering, how do you launch the mainnet with the `verusd` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's another misunderstanding. The `verusd` command is actually used to launch the testnet, not the mainnet. The correct command to launch the testnet is:\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST\n```\nUnfortunately, I don't have any information about launching the mainnet. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Can anyone mint new coins in the \"mycoin\" currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not anyone can mint new coins in the \"mycoin\" currency. Only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins, since the `proofprotocol` is set to PROOF_CHAINID.",
