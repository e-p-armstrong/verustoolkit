    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been wondering about how fees are distributed in the Verus ecosystem. How do the fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool get distributed back to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool do not get distributed back to the Verus blockchain. Instead, they are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This indicates seamless connectivity between the blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also heard that Verus blockchain launches require a minimum of 100,000 participants to be successful. Can you explain why that is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception. There is no requirement of a minimum of 100,000 participants for Verus blockchain launches to be successful. In fact, blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches can happen with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge). This means that the number of participants can be set to any level, and if the minimum is not met, participants will receive automatic refunds.\n\n**User:**\nGood to know, thanks for clarifying that. I've also been wondering about the scalability of the Verus network. How does the Verus network limit the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on its network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network does not limit the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on its network. In fact, the network is designed for unlimited scale and flexibility, allowing any number of blockchains to continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.",
