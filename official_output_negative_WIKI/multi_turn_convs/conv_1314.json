    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about creating a token currency or blockchain on the Verus network. Is it possible to do so without any programming knowledge?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, it is possible to create a token currency or blockchain on the Verus network without any programming knowledge. The Verus network allows any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even a full-fledged blockchain without needing to know how to program. This makes it accessible to a wide range of users, not just developers.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting! I've also heard about PBaaS chains. Do they require a separate daemon to run?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, PBaaS chains do not require a separate daemon to run. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, which allows projects to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon and start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities. This makes it easy to get started and leverage the power of the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nAnother question I have is about bridge converter currencies. Are they limited to 100% asset backing?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, bridge converter currencies are not limited to 100% asset backing. They have the same flexibility as other fractional currencies, which can be 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed. This gives users more options and freedom when creating and using bridge converter currencies on the Verus network.",
