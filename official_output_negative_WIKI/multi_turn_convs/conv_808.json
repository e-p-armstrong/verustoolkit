    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still learning about VerusIDs, and I was wondering, can you explain why Verus IDs are not transferable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some misunderstanding! Verus IDs are transferable. They can be transferred by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party\u2019s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.\n\n**User:**\nThat clears things up! Another question I had was, what are the requirements for Verus IDs to spend or sign on behalf of an identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach identity must have a set of addresses (1 or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. This way, you have control over who can spend or sign on behalf of your identity.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! And one more question, what happens if the Recovery authority tries to modify an unrevoked identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Recovery authority may not modify an unrevoked identity at all. It may only redefine or recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity. This ensures that the Recovery authority can only step in when an identity has been revoked, and not otherwise interfere with an active identity.",
