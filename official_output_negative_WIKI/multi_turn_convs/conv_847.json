    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a tokenized ID control, but I'm not sure about the requirements. How can I create a tokenized ID control without specifying the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` flag in the currency definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't create a tokenized ID control without specifying the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` flag in the currency definition. The `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` flag, along with the `OPTION_TOKEN` flag, is required to define a tokenized ID control. Additionally, the max supply of the token must be 1 satoshi, which is either pre-allocated or pre-converted to. You need to include this flag in your currency definition to create a tokenized ID control.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I have another question. Can I register an identity with a fractional currency as its parent without specifying the parent currency in the identity definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you must specify the parent currency in the identity definition when registering an identity with a fractional currency as its parent. The `registernamecommitment` command now takes two additional positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. The parent currency must be specified in the identity definition for this to work. You can't register an identity with a fractional currency as its parent without including the parent currency in the identity definition.",
