    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm still learning about VerusIDs and the ecosystem. Can you help me with something? How do I use Verus ID and NFT Marketplace to buy and sell VerusIDs off-chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can't use Verus ID and NFT Marketplace to buy and sell VerusIDs off-chain. The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform that allows you to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain, in a peer-to-peer manner, without any intermediaries. This means that all transactions are executed on-chain, and not off-chain. So, if you want to buy or sell VerusIDs, you'll need to do it on the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, thanks for the clarification. I have another question. Can I use Verus Vault to spend funds from a locked VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use Verus Vault to spend funds from a locked VerusID. When you lock a VerusID with Verus Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked. However, you can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network to earn rewards. So, while you can't spend funds from a locked ID, you can still earn rewards from it.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. One more question. Do I need to have multiple identities to enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need to have multiple identities to enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities. To enable these features, you only need to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. So, you can set up revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault with just one primary identity and one or more secondary IDs.",
