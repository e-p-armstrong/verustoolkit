    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard some concerns about Verus Fee Pooling technology, and I'm not quite sure what to make of them. Does Verus Fee Pooling technology weaken blockchain security?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus Fee Pooling technology does the opposite - it strengthens blockchain security! This technology preserves the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time. This approach addresses the legitimate concerns expressed by Vitalik Buterin regarding ETH and ETH 2.0, and provides a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model. So, to alleviate your concerns, Verus Fee Pooling is a positive development for blockchain security.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! I've also been wondering about how the fees are distributed. What percentage of the aggregate fee pool do miners and stakers take in the Verus Fee Pooling model?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus Fee Pooling model, miners and stakers take up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool. This ensures a fair and sustainable distribution of fees among miners and stakers. It's designed to be a win-win for everyone involved!\n\n**User:**\nOne more question - I've heard about Verus Vault, but is it only available on the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault is actually a feature introduced on the new Verus testnet. It provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management and enables various use cases such as trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, and estate planning. So, you can try it out on the testnet and see how it works!",

In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
