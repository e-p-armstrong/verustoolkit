    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there, I'm trying to use the `getblockhashes` method to retrieve a single block hash given a specific timestamp. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI see what you're trying to do! Unfortunately, the `getblockhashes` method doesn't quite work that way. It actually retrieves a range of block hashes between two specified timestamps, not a single block hash given a specific timestamp. It takes two required arguments: `high` (the newer block timestamp) and `low` (the older block timestamp), as well as an optional `options` object that can specify additional criteria for the returned block hashes.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was also wondering about the `noOrphans` option in the `getblockhashes` method. What's the default value for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the documentation, the `noOrphans` option is a boolean option that can be set to `true` to only include blocks on the main chain. However, the default value for this option is not specified.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. I was also trying to use the `getblockheader` method to retrieve information about a range of block headers. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, unfortunately not. The `getblockheader` method only retrieves information about a single block header specified by its hash. It takes two arguments: the block hash and an optional `verbose` flag that determines the format of the returned data. If `verbose` is `true`, it returns a JSON object with information about the block header; if `verbose` is `false`, it returns a string of serialized, hex-encoded data for the block header.",
