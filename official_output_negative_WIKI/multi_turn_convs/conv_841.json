    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to figure out how to execute transactions on the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. I was wondering, do I need to go through a centralized intermediary to do so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need a centralized intermediary to execute transactions on the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. In fact, transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, peer-to-peer, without any intermediary necessary. You can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! But I have another question. I've locked my VerusID with Verus Vault. Can I still spend funds from that ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot spend funds from a VerusID that is locked with Verus Vault. When you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. However, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so, and you can also still receive funds.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks! One more question. I was trying to set up revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities, but I'm not sure if I've done it correctly. Is it possible to enable these capabilities without a primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it is not possible to enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities without a primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. Having one primary identity, and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured is a requirement to enable these capabilities. Make sure you have those set up correctly and you should be good to go!",
