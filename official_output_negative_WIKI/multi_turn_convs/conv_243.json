    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API to send funds from multiple addresses to a single recipient. Can you explain how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `sendcurrency` API can be used to send funds from a single address or from all wallet funds (using \"*\") to one or multiple recipients. It cannot be used to send funds from multiple addresses to a single recipient. The correct ways to use the `sendcurrency` API are shown in the examples provided, such as sending from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@), or sending from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@).\n\n**User:**\nThat's not what I thought. Okay, moving on. I'm trying to create a currency, but I don't have an ID with the same name as the currency I want to create. Can I still do it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou cannot create a currency without having an ID of the same name. The controller of an ID with a specific name is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. So, to create a currency, you need to have an ID with the same name as the currency you want to create.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, can anyone create a currency with any name they want?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not anyone can create a currency with any name they want. Only the controller of an ID with a specific name can create a currency of that name. This means that if someone else already has an ID with the name you want to use for your currency, you will not be able to create a currency with that name.",
