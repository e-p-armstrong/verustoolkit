    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to launch a currency on Verus, and I'm a bit confused about the requirements. Can you explain why a currency launch requires 500 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there's a small mistake there. A currency launch requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD, not 500. This is a necessary condition for the currency to launch successfully. Do you have any other questions about the launch process?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the correction! I've got another question. How can I create new tokens after a currency has launched using a decentralized issuance option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, it seems you've been misinformed. After a currency has launched, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option, not a decentralized one. I'm happy to help clarify any other questions you might have about token creation, though!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What happens if I send the command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you send the command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, it will effectively park your conversion until the token launches. At that point, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. Does that make sense?",
