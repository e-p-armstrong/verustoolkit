    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with Verus and I was wondering, is this software considered stable and ready for production use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. This software is **experimental and unfinished**. It explicitly warns that it's \"Use at your own risk!\" and that there's no warranty for any kind of damage. This suggests that the software is not yet stable or ready for production use. You should be cautious when using it and be prepared for potential issues.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I was also thinking about modifying the software and then redistributing it under a proprietary license. Is that allowed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot modify this software and then redistribute it under a proprietary license. The software's license grants permission to \"deal in the Software without restriction\", but only if you include the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. This implies that any modifications or redistributions must also be under an open-source license that allows free use, modification, and distribution. You'll need to keep it open-source if you decide to modify and redistribute it.",
