    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get some information about blocks. How do I get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for a random block?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for a random block. The `getcurrencystate` command allows you to get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block, a specific block, or a range of blocks with a specific period between them. You need to specify the block number or range of blocks you're interested in. Would you like to know more about how to use the `getcurrencystate` command?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification. I have another question. Can I use the `refundfailedlaunch` command to refund contributions made to a successful PbaaS chain launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `refundfailedlaunch` command is used to refund contributions made to a failed PbaaS chain launch, not a successful one. It's specifically designed to handle situations where a launch didn't go as planned. You wouldn't want to use it for a successful launch, as it's meant to help recover from a failed launch.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification. One more question: Is the software provided with a warranty or guarantee?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The disclaimer clearly states that there is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use.
