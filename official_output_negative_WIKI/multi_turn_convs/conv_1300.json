    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few questions about the Verus settings. What is the default timeout during HTTP requests set to? I think I heard it was 60...\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. According to the documentation, the default timeout during HTTP requests is set to 30. However, you can modify this timeout using the `-rpcservertimeout=<n>` option if needed.\n\n**User:**\nAlright, thanks for the correction! I've got another question. I was looking at the software details and I saw that it was compiled on January 1, 2020. Who compiled it on that date?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's some misinformation there. The software wasn't compiled on January 1, 2020. According to the information I have, the software was compiled by Oink.vrsc@, and the last revision date was May 3, 2024.",
