    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about security software and Verus. Can you explain why Avast and Kaspersky do not flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" due to the presence of mining software, which could potentially be used to exploit your PC if installed by a third party. This is a warning to inform users about the potential risks. The flagging is likely a precautionary measure to alert users about the potential risks associated with mining software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also got a question about updates. Is the v0.8.0-4 update mandatory for all users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the v0.8.0-4 update is not mandatory for all users. This update is mandatory only for those who wish to continue using testnet after transactions between the Verus and Rinkeby testnets resume flowing. So, if you're not planning on using testnet, you don't need to update to v0.8.0-4.",
