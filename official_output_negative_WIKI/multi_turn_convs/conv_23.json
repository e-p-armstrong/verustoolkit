    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about verifying downloads. How do I verify a download using just the archive file and without a separate txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't verify a download using just the archive file and without a separate txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is included for each download, and this file is necessary for verification. You need to extract the downloaded archive, verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Another question: Can I use any identity to sign the packages for download verification?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't use any identity to sign the packages for download verification. The packages have been signed with the specific identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". This ensures that the downloads are authentic and come from a trusted source.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if the signature is invalid when verifying a download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the signature is invalid when verifying a download, the verification process will fail, and the download will not be considered authentic. This is an important security measure to ensure that you're getting the correct and trusted files from the Verus Coin Foundation.",
