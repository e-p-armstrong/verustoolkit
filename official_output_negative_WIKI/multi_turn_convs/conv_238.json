    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking at the transaction output, and I was wondering about the \"vjoinsplit\" field. What is its purpose, and why is it always present?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"vjoinsplit\" field is actually only present for transactions with a version greater than or equal to 2. It's not always present, and its purpose is to provide additional information related to the transaction's joinsplit data.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also trying to figure out how to get the transaction's value in USD from the output. Is there a way to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe transaction output doesn't provide the value in USD. The \"value\" field in the \"out\" array provides the value in VRSC, not USD. You would need to use an exchange rate or a separate API to convert the VRSC value to USD.",
