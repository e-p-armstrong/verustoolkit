    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with the `submitblock` command. I was wondering, what happens if I don't include the \"jsonparametersobject\" parameter when using the command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"jsonparametersobject\" parameter is currently ignored, so it doesn't matter if you include it or not. The command will still attempt to submit the new block to the network using the provided \"hexdata\". So, you can go ahead and use the command without worrying about including that parameter.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Another question I had was, if I use the `submitblock` command and the node already has a valid copy of the block, will it return \"inconclusive\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, if the node already has a valid copy of the block, the `submitblock` command will return \"duplicate\", not \"inconclusive\". \"Inconclusive\" is returned when the node has not validated the block, and it may not be on the node's current best chain. So, if you're seeing \"duplicate\", it means the node already has the block and there's no need to submit it again.",
