    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about something. I've heard that VerusIDs aren't compatible with non-Verus systems. Can you explain why that is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception. VerusIDs are compatible with non-Verus systems. The VerusID protocol is a protocol that can be implemented on non-Verus systems. So, you can use VerusIDs with other systems, and they should work just fine.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! I was also wondering about DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets. Are they not integrated into the Verus consensus protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus DeFi protocol does integrate DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocol. This ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing problems like miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. So, DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets are indeed integrated into the Verus consensus protocol.",
