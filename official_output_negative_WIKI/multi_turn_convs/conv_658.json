    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got some more questions about VerusIDs and Verus Vault. How does a locked VerusID prevent a 5 dollar wrench attack, since anyone with the primary keys can unlock and access the funds immediately?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, a locked VerusID can prevent a 5 dollar wrench attack because, even with the primary keys, the unlock process involves a predetermined unlock time delay. This delay, such as a 24-hour delay, allows the revocation and recovery authority identities to detect and respond to unauthorized unlock attempts before the funds can be accessed. This provides a decentralized solution to the 5 dollar wrench attack.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Another question I have is, is Verus Vault only limited to protecting funds, and not IDs or NFTs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault is not limited to protecting only funds. It also provides the same level of security and recovery for IDs and NFTs, in addition to time locks for various purposes like vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. Verus Vault is a comprehensive solution for securing various types of digital assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I'm also interested in exploring the Verus testnet. Do I need programming experience to create a new blockchain or liquidity pool on the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need programming experience to create a new identity, currency, liquidity pool, or blockchain on the Verus testnet. The testnet provides an easy-to-use GUI for basic operations, as well as a command-line interface for more advanced functions, making it accessible to users without programming expertise. You can experiment and learn without needing to be a developer.",

            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet\nWith an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.",
