    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been wondering about how to execute transactions on the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. Do I need to go through a centralized intermediary to do so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need a centralized intermediary to execute transactions on the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. In fact, the marketplace allows for completely decentralized transactions, where you can buy and sell VerusIDs or NFTs directly, peer-to-peer, without any intermediary necessary. That's the beauty of decentralized systems like Verus!\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I've also been experimenting with Verus Vault. Can I spend funds from a VerusID that is locked with Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot spend funds from a VerusID that is locked with Verus Vault. When you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. However, you can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network to earn rewards. So, while you can't spend the funds, you can still use them to earn more!",

            "#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.#### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.",
