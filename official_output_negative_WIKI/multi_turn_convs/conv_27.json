    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I had a question about the testnet reset. I didn't delete my wallet files, so how do I recover my VRSCTEST wallet now?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo recover your VRSCTEST wallet after the testnet reset, you should delete the VRSCTEST directories before running the new update. The directories to delete are: `~/.komodo/vrsctest` on Linux, `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest` on MacOS, and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` on Windows. Failing to do so may cause issues with your wallet. Make sure to delete those directories before running the update, and you should be good to go!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. And, I was wondering, is there some kind of warranty or guarantee that the software will work as expected?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The authors or copyright holders will not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. So, it's essential to use the software at your own risk.",
