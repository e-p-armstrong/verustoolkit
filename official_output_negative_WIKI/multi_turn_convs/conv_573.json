    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI have a question about minting new coins in a currency. Can anyone mint new coins in a currency with `proofprotocol` set to 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins in a currency with `proofprotocol` set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID). This means that there's a level of control and authority required to mint new coins, and it's not open to just anyone. Does that help clarify things?",
