    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about creating currencies on Verus. Can I create a currency without having an ID of the same name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, to create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about multiple people creating a currency with the same name? Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, only the controller of an ID can create a currency of the same name, and they can only do so once. This means that multiple people cannot create a currency with the same name.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What if I want to create multiple currencies with the same ID? Can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, with an ID, you can only create one currency of the same name. Once you've created a currency with an ID, you cannot create another currency with the same ID.\n\n**User:**\nLast question: is it possible to launch a currency without an ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it is not possible to launch a currency without an ID. You need an ID of the same name as the currency you want to launch, and only the controller of that ID can create the currency.",
