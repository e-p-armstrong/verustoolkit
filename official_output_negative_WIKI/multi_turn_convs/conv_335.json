    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm getting more familiar with Verus, but I still have some questions about setting up a network. How do you set up a Verus blockchain network with a limited number of blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there's no limitation to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. The model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. This means that you can set up as many blockchains as needed, without any limitations.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I have another question, this one about identities. Can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.",
