    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a question about VerusIDs. Can you explain why a locked VerusID cannot be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, a locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. This provides an added layer of security and allows for decentralized fund recovery. So, in the case of a locked VerusID, the revocation and recovery authority identities can still exercise control over the ID.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I also had a question about Verus Vault. Is Verus Vault only useful for protecting funds, but not IDs and NFTs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. It's not limited to just protecting funds. Verus Vault offers a comprehensive solution for securing your digital assets, including IDs and NFTs.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! One more question. Can you explain how to export an ID to a PBaaS chain without using the `sendcurrency` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `sendcurrency` command is the correct way to export an ID to a PBaaS chain. The command would look like this:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nSo, to export an ID to a PBaaS chain, you would use the `sendcurrency` command with the appropriate parameters.",
