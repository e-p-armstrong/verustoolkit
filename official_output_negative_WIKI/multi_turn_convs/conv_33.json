    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about creating currencies on the Verus network. Can you explain how to launch a currency without any funding requirements?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, launching a currency on Verus does require some funding. Specifically, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate the currency launch. Additionally, the currency launch requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\n\nSo, unfortunately, it's not possible to launch a currency without any funding requirements. But if you have any questions about the process or need help with launching a currency, I'm here to assist you!\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Another question I had was, is it possible to create new tokens in a decentralized manner after a token has launched?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, creating new tokens after a token has launched is only possible through a centralized issuance option. There is no decentralized manner to create new tokens after launch.\n\nSo, while Verus offers a lot of decentralized features, token creation after launch is not one of them. If you have any more questions about token creation or management, I'd be happy to help!",
