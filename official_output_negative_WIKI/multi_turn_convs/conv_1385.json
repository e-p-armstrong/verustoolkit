    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new blockchain on the k platform, but I've been told it can only support a limited number of blockchains. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to help clarify that for you! The k platform is actually fractal, which means it can support an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. This is one of the key features of the k platform, allowing for a high degree of scalability and flexibility. So, you can go ahead and create that new blockchain without worrying about any limitations!\n\n**User:**\nGreat, thanks for the help! I have another question. What happens when you revoke an identity with a time lock or time delay in place?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you revoke an identity, its locked status is cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height that may have been set. Additionally, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. So, even if there's a time lock or delay, revoking the identity will immediately clear the lock.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! One more question. How do I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have less than 1000 VRSC in reserve?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getcurrencyconverters` API does the opposite of what you're looking for. It retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It doesn't retrieve currencies with less than 1000 VRSC in reserve. You can use the API by specifying the currencies you're interested in, such as `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth`, which will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
