    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand how to use the \"includeWatchonly\" argument in Verus. Can I use it to exclude transactions to watchonly addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no. The \"includeWatchonly\" argument is used to include transactions to watchonly addresses, not to exclude them. It's a bit counterintuitive, I know, but that's how it works. So, if you want to include transactions to watchonly addresses in your query, you would use the \"includeWatchonly\" argument. If you don't want to include them, you would simply omit the argument or set it to false. Does that make sense?",
