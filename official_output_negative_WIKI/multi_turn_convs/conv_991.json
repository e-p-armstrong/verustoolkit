    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm getting a bit concerned about the software. What kind of warranty does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI understand your concern. The software does not come with any warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. It is provided \"as is\" without any guarantees. We're committed to making it work for you, but we can't make any promises.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes me a bit nervous. Are the authors or copyright holders of the software liable for any claims or damages arising from the use of the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the authors or copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. We're doing our best to provide a good product, but we can't take responsibility for any issues that might arise.\n\n**User:**\nI've been getting some warnings from my antivirus software. Why do Avast and Kaspersky flag the software as a virus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAvast and Kaspersky don't actually flag the software as a virus, but rather as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software includes mining capabilities, which may be installed by a third party to exploit the user's PC. We're working to make sure our software is safe and secure, but these warnings can be triggered by the mining features. Don't worry, we're on it!",
