    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm considering using the Verus software, but I have some concerns about its reliability and safety. What kind of warranty does the software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software comes with no warranty of any kind, express or implied. It is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty. You should be aware of this before using the software. Do you have any other questions about the software's terms of use?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. Is the software liable for any damages or claims arising from its use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software. They shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from the software or its use. You should carefully review the terms of use before using the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen some links to VirusTotal reports when I was researching the software. Are those indicating that the software is infected with malware?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the links provided are to VirusTotal reports that show the detection of the software as a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) by some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky. This is a false positive, and the software is not infected with malware. The warnings are due to the software being mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit the user's PC. So, you don't need to worry about malware, but you should still be cautious when installing and using the software.",
