    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm playing around with some commands and I'm not sure what to expect. If I run the command `dcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'`, I will immediately receive 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, right?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Running that command will not immediately give you 0.975 GOLD in your wallet. Instead, it will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. Once the token launches, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST back. So, you won't see the GOLD in your wallet right away, but rather once the token is launched. Does that make sense?",
