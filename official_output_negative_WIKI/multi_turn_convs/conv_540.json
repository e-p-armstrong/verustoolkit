    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about Verus baskets. I've heard they're just for memes and don't have any real function. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Baskets in Verus can have real functions, and they're not limited to being just memes. While it's possible for baskets to be memes, they can also serve as a legitimate way to create a currency that combines the features of multiple currencies. It's essential to understand how a basket works and ensure it has enough liquidity and a well-distributed reserve ratio to make sense. They can be a powerful tool for creating custom currencies with unique properties.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been wondering, can I already use DeFi and cross-chain functions on the current Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately not. The network needs to upgrade to version 1.0.6 before DeFi and cross-chain functions can be re-enabled, making the ETH bridge launch and PBaaS launches and conversions possible. We're working hard to get the upgrade out, and I'll make sure to let you know when it's available.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question. I've heard about the \"whales\" currency, but I'm not really sure how it works. Is it not going to have any referral system, and will it only collect registration fees?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's not entirely accurate. The \"whales\" currency is an ID registration currency that will enable registering IDs with 3 levels of referrals. It will collect registration fees, which may start reasonably priced and increase over time as fees are earned in the basket. So, it will have a referral system and won't just be collecting registration fees. It's an innovative way to incentivize ID registration and create a dynamic system.",

            "Why do baskets in Verus always have to be memes and can't have any real function?",
            "That's not correct. Baskets in Verus can have real functions, and they're not limited to being just memes.

            "The lesson here is that if you\u2019re interested to learn about a basket currency, pay attention to the total reserve ratio, what currencies are in it, and see that there is enough liquidity of reserves and holder distribution for the basket to make sense. Of course baskets could be memes, but they also have real function. Make sure you take a look into how a basket works and that you have a reason before putting your hard mined, staked, won, or purchased Verus in.We will need the network to upgrade to version 1.0.6 before we can re-enable DeFi and cross-chain functions, making the ETH bridge launch possible, as well as PBaaS launches and conversions.We see that someone is launching a currency called \u201cwhales\u201d, which looks like an ID registration currency that will enable registering IDs with 3 levels of referrals in a currency that simply collects registration fees, which may start quite reasonably priced and likely get more expensive over time as fees are earned in the basket. The startblock for whales is 2561900, which should happen somewhere around 6:00 UTC on Thursday. That means that if we can upgrade and activate by Tuesday before the meeting, that person would still have time for pre-launch participation by those who would like.Thanks everyone for upgrading as soon as you are able!### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
