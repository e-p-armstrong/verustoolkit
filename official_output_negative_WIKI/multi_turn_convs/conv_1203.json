    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with formatting commands on the Windows command line. I was told I need to use backslashes (`\\`) instead of double quotes (`\"`) when formatting commands, but I'm not sure why. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been a misunderstanding! When formatting commands on the Windows command line, you actually need to substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character, and substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters. This is because the Windows command prompt (`cmd.com`) has different formatting requirements than Linux and MacOS.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification! But I'm also using Verus Desktop. Do the command line formatting rules for Windows also apply to Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the command line formatting rules for Windows only apply to the native Windows command prompt (`cmd.com`). Verus Desktop will accept commands as listed, without the need for formatting changes. You can use the commands as shown, without worrying about the Windows-specific formatting rules.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! One more question: are the command line formatting rules for Windows the same as those for Linux and MacOS?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the command line formatting rules for Windows are different from those for Linux and MacOS. On Windows, you need to substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character, and substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters, whereas on Linux and MacOS, the formatting is as shown in the CLI help. So, be sure to check the specific formatting rules for each platform when using the command line.",
