    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating a new blockchain on the Verus testnet. How do I do it without incurring any costs beyond the initial setup fee?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou're in luck! There is no initial setup fee for creating a new blockchain on the Verus testnet. In fact, there are no costs beyond the standard public blockchain network fees. The Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables anyone to create a fractional reserve currency on an independent blockchain with cross-chain interoperability, without any additional fees.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I was also wondering, is it possible to have more than 3 eras on a Verus testnet blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the Verus testnet documentation, there is a maximum of 3 eras on a Verus testnet blockchain. This means that it is not possible to have more than 3 eras on a Verus testnet blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Another question: Can I create a new blockchain on the Verus testnet without having any VRSCTEST in my wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot create a new blockchain on the Verus testnet without having VRSCTEST in your wallet. VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet to make a chain.\n\n**User:**\nLast question: Do the fees for converting between currencies on the Verus testnet go to a central authority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the fees for converting between currencies on the Verus testnet do not go to a central authority. The 0.01% fees for conversions go directly to the miners and stakers of the network, ensuring that the process is fully decentralized.",
