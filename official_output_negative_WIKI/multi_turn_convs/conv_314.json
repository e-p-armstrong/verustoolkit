    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been wondering about creating currencies on Verus. Can anyone create a currency with any name they want, without needing an ID of the same name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, that's not correct. To create a currency with a specific name, you need to have an ID of the same name, and only the controller of that ID can create a currency with that name. This ensures that currency names are unique and controlled by their respective ID owners. So, if you want to create a currency with a specific name, you'll need to have an ID with that name first.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But what if I want to create multiple currencies with the same name? Can I just use different IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not possible. The controller of an ID can only create a currency with that name once. If you want to create another currency with the same name, you would need a different ID with the same name, which is not allowed. The system is designed to ensure that currency names are unique and controlled by their respective ID owners, so you can't create multiple currencies with the same name, even with different IDs.",
