    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand currency definitions in Verus, and I have a few questions. What is the purpose of the \"parent\" field in a currency definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"parent\" field specifies the parent blockchain ID and is a required field that defines the relationship between the currency and its underlying blockchain. It's an important part of defining a currency in Verus. Do you have any other questions about currency definitions or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. I've been trying to understand notarizations, and I was wondering if you could explain how to use the \"notarizationprotocol\" field to determine the protocol number for bridged notarizations.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the \"notarizationprotocol\" field doesn't determine the protocol number for bridged notarizations. Instead, it determines the variations in cross-chain or bridged notarizations. The field is an integer that specifies the protocol number. So, it's more of a identifier for the protocol rather than a way to determine it.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I've also been trying to understand liquidity baskets, and I was wondering how to use the \"weights\" field to specify the relative currency weights for a liquidity basket.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"weights\" field is actually only returned for a liquidity basket, and it specifies the relative currency weights as an array of numbers. You can't actually use this field to specify the weights; instead, it's returned as part of the currency definition. So, it's more of a way to get information about the liquidity basket rather than a way to configure it.",
