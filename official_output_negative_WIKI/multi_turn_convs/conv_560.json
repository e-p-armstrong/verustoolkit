    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API to send funds from a single address or identity. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `sendcurrency` API is designed to provide more control when sending from and to **multiple** addresses or identities, not just a single one. It's meant to give users more flexibility and power when managing their transactions. If you're looking to send funds from a single address or identity, you might want to look into other APIs or methods that are more suited for that purpose.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification! I have another question. What happens to the revocation identity after an ID is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter an ID is revoked, the revocation identity **loses all control** over the revoked ID, including the ability to change the revocation identity itself. This is a change from the previous behavior, where the revocation identity could still make changes to the ID after revocation.",
