    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit confused about how Verus works. Can you explain how Verus only allows developers to create new tokens and blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not accurate. Verus enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. This means that users without extensive development knowledge can still create their own tokens and blockchains. Verus is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to everyone, not just developers.\n\n**User:**\nI see, thanks for clarifying that. How do I create a new blockchain on Verus that is not merge-mineable or interoperable with other blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, that's not possible. Verus enables users to create new blockchains that are merge-mineable and interoperable with other blockchains in the Verus network. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon, starting with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities. The idea behind Verus is to create a connected and interoperable network, so creating a blockchain that's not merge-mineable or interoperable wouldn't fit with that vision.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I understand. What's the purpose of DeFi liquidity pools on Verus if they don't provide any incentives to miners and stakers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's not correct. Verus DeFi liquidity pools do provide fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols. Miners and stakers play a crucial role in maintaining the network, and the DeFi liquidity pools provide them with the incentives they need to continue doing so.",
