    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm new to Verus and I'm considering using the mining software provided by the project. But I want to make sure it's safe to use. Is the mining software provided by this project completely safe and virus-free?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhile the software itself is not malware, some antivirus programs like Avast and Kaspersky may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. It's essential to understand the risks and use the software responsibly. So, while it's not inherently malicious, you should exercise caution when using it.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering about the stability of the software. Is version 0.5.5c of the software completely stable and reliable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not. This is experimental and unfinished software, and you should use it at your own risk. There's no warranty for any kind of damage, and you should be aware of the potential risks involved. Upgrading to version 0.5.5 or greater is highly recommended, as it includes a portability fix for a fault on some CPUs. So, it's not a good idea to rely solely on version 0.5.5c.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. One more question. I was wondering about the licensing terms of the software. Is the software proprietary, and can I only use it under certain conditions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is not proprietary. The license terms explicitly grant permission to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software, without restriction, as long as the enclosed copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. This is an open-source license that allows for free use and modification of the software. So, you're free to use and modify the software as you see fit, as long as you include the necessary copyright and permission notices.",
