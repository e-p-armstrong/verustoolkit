    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've got some questions about the recent release of v1.0.7. I was wondering, why did the PBaaS and DeFi functions remain paused on Mainnet after the release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, PBaaS and DeFi functions have resumed on Mainnet with the release of v1.0.7. The upgrade is highly recommended for Mainnet and mandatory for continued Testnet use. All LP fees from exiting a DeFi basket's primary currency will now be properly burned into those currencies before conversion operations take place. So, you should be good to go!\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I was thinking of launching a PBaaS chain with zero block reward emissions. Is it safe to do that immediately after upgrading to v1.0.7?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAlthough it's technically possible to launch a PBaaS chain with zero block reward emissions, it's not recommended until everyone is on v1.0.7 or later and it's announced that such PBaaS configurations are well supported on the network. Launching a chain with zero emissions before that might cause issues with cross-chain function for about a month. So, it's best to wait a bit before doing that.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the warning. What if I upgrade to v1.0.7 and launch a PBaaS chain with a non-zero block reward emission? Will I have issues with cross-chain function then?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, if you upgrade to v1.0.7 and launch a PBaaS chain with a non-zero block reward emission, you should not have issues with cross-chain function. The potential issues mentioned in the release notes only apply to PBaaS chains with zero block reward emissions. So, you're good to go with a non-zero emission chain!",

If you choose to do so anyhow, your chain should properly launch, but for about the next month, you may have issues with cross-chain function, unless you understand and plan appropriately. If launching a chain with zero emissions is important to you, and you seriously can\u2019t wait, please discuss with someone in development or support to understand your options. We don\u2019t believe that this is a critical early use case, so we actually don\u2019t expect it to be an issue for anyone.",
