    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still learning about Verus and currencies. Can anyone create a currency with a specific name, without needing an ID of the same name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name, and the controller of that ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. You can't just create a currency with any name without having the corresponding ID. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Another question I had was, is it possible to create a currency without preallocating funds to it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not possible. When defining a currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch. Additionally, there needs to be a certain amount of VRSCTEST preconverted to the new currency in order to launch it. So, you can't just create a currency out of thin air without putting in the necessary funds.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Can I create new tokens for a currency after it has launched without a centralized issuance option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not currently possible. After a currency has launched, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. So, if you want to create more tokens for your currency, you'll need to have a centralized issuance option in place.",
