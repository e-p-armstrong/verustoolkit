    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've got a couple of questions about using the Verus Desktop. Can I use a currency with the same name as a PBaaS chain, like BTC or ETH, in the Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use a currency with the same name as a PBaaS chain in the Verus Desktop, at least not in this testnet release. If a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, you won't be able to use the same name for a PBaaS chain. However, this limitation is considered errata and will be resolved before mainnet availability. \n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been wondering, is the Verus Desktop software considered finished and stable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus Desktop software is explicitly labeled as \"experimental and unfinished software\" and comes with a disclaimer warning users to \"use at your own risk\". This implies that the software is still in development and may have issues or bugs that need to be addressed. So, while it's available for testing and feedback, it's not yet considered a finished or stable product.",
