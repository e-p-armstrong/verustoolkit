    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there! I've got some questions about the Verus DeFi protocol. Specifically, how do the liquidity pools handle miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol actually addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This way, the protocol prevents MEV and front-running, making it a more secure and fair system for all users.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Another question I had was about what happens to fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool when a new blockchain is launched with a bridge converter liquidity pool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This is because the bridge converter liquidity pool runs on the new blockchain, providing seamless connectivity. So, the fees stay on the new blockchain, benefiting its users and ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question. If I launch a new blockchain with a crowdfunding currency, what happens if I don't reach the minimum participation levels?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the minimum participation levels are not met by the start time of your blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. So, you don't have to worry about losing your funds if the crowdfunding effort doesn't reach its goals. The system is designed to be fair and secure for all parties involved.",
