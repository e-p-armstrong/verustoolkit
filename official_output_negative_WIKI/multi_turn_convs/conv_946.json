    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with the Verus public testnet, and I was wondering why it only allows converting between two specific currencies, and doesn't support cross-chain conversions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misinformation going on! The Verus public testnet actually enables 100% liquid conversion between any currencies, including cross-chain conversions, at any volume. Conversions are fully decentralized and require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network. The Verus protocol calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread. You can try it out and see for yourself!\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds awesome! But, I've also heard that creating a new blockchain and currency on the Verus public testnet requires permission from the Verus team. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true! The Verus public testnet is not a centralized system, and anyone can create a new blockchain and currency on it without needing permission from the Verus team. The Verus protocol enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between currencies. You can create your own chain and currency without any restrictions!\n\n**User:**\nThat's amazing! But, I've also seen that it requires 1 VRSCTEST per block of notarization to make a chain. Is that correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct! According to the chain definition, a minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization is required, and VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet to make a chain. So, it's actually much more accessible than you thought!",
