    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how decentralized currencies work in version 1.0.1. Specifically, how do they handle identity registrations and fees?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn version 1.0.1, decentralized currencies actually burn fees during identity registrations, which affects the supply and available future registrations on that currency. This is different from centralized currencies, where the fee for registration is sent directly to the identity of the currency. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I also had a question about centralized currencies in version 1.0.1. What happens to a centralized currency when its endblock is set?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the endblock of a centralized currency is set in version 1.0.1, it does not remain a centralized currency. Instead, it converts to a decentralized currency, losing its special control and capabilities. So, basically, it becomes more like a decentralized currency, with no central authority controlling it. Do you have any more questions about decentralized or centralized currencies in version 1.0.1?",

            "### What\u2019s New\nIn addition to the full PBaaS protocol and all capabilities previously described, version 1.0.1 will also include some new capabilities that were previously not in the PBaaS protocol. The capabilities basically extend the idea of a centralized currency to include the ability to launch temporarily centralized currencies, including those that can issue identities. This is achieved by setting the \u201cendblock\u201d on a centralized currency launch of either a token or liquidity basket, enabling:\n 1) Minting of currency on demand by the identity of the currency as part of the `sendcurrency`command.\n 2) Burning a liquidity basket currency, but instead of affecting the supply/reserve ratio as normal burns do, the identity of a centralized currency can also burn currency to affect the reserve ratio weights of the currency.\n 3) Registering identities on a currency. When an identity is registered on a centralized currency, the fee for the registration is not burned into the currency, but sent directly to the identity of the currency. This is true for token or liquidity basket currencies. For decentralized currencies, fees are burned, which on a liquidity basket, puts them into the liquidity pool for all LPs to share in earnings, and for a standard token, reduces the supply and available future registrations on that currency.\n 4) In v1.0.1, setting the endblock of a centralized currency causes all centralized capabilities of the same ID to end, converting it in whatever state it currently is in a decentralized currency with no special control over it after that occurs by any identity on the network.\n 5) v1.0.0 did not allow a decentralized non-liquidity token to register identities. v1.0.1 does.",
