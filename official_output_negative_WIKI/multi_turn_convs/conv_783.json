    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new blockchain on k, but I've been told that it doesn't support fractal technology and can only have one blockchain at a time. Is that correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's actually a misconception! k is actually fractal, which means it can support an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. This allows for the creation of multiple blockchains on the k platform. You should be able to create a new blockchain on k without any issues.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great news! I have another question, though. What happens if you try to revoke a locked identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRevoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. This means that even if an identity is locked, it can still be revoked, and its locked status will be cleared as a result.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But what if the locked identity tries to revoke itself? Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. This is a security feature to prevent unauthorized revocations. So, if an identity is locked, it will need to be revoked by an authorized party, rather than being able to revoke itself.",
