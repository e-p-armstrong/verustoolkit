    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the implications of setting `proofprotocol` to 2 in \"mycoin\". Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to clarify. So, you're wondering what setting `proofprotocol` to 2 means for \"mycoin\", right?\n\n**User:**\nExactly! I'm not sure what the implications are.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWell, setting `proofprotocol` to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID) has a specific effect. It means that only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. So, not just anyone can create new coins in \"mycoin\". The control is limited to the designated chain ID controller.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any other questions about this setting or \"mycoin\" in general?",
