    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about Verus Vault. I've heard that it doesn't provide any protection against the 5 dollar wrench attack. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. Verus Vault does provide protection against the 5 dollar wrench attack. By setting a lock with a predetermined unlock time, you can ensure that even if someone gains access to your primary keys, they won't be able to spend or access your funds immediately. This allows you or a designated revocation authority to detect and respond to the unauthorized unlock, effectively preventing the 5 dollar wrench attack. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. But I've also heard that there's a way to spend or access funds from a locked VerusID without waiting for the unlock time. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. It's not possible to spend or access funds from a locked VerusID without waiting for the unlock time. Even with a multisig of primary keys, you must first unlock and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before you can spend or access funds. This is a security feature designed to protect your assets.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. And one more question: I've heard that Verus Vault only provides protection for funds, but not for IDs and NFTs. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Verus Vault provides protection not only for funds, but also for IDs and NFTs. In addition to securing your funds, Verus Vault offers the same level of security for your IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other purposes such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. So you can have peace of mind knowing that all of your digital assets are protected.",
