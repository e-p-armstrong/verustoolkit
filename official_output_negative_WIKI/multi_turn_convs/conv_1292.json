    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in trying out the latest features of Verus before they're released. How do I join the Verus mainnet to test them out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you don't join the mainnet to test the latest capabilities before they are released. Instead, you join the Verus testnet (VRSCTEST) to test the latest capabilities before they are released to mainnet. The testnet coins hold no value, so it's a great way to test your goals without spending VRSC. This way, you can get a feel for the new features and provide feedback to the developers before they're released to the mainnet.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I'm on a Windows machine, and I'm not super familiar with the command line. How do I enter commands on a Windows command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn a Windows command line, you enter the commands as shown without the surrounding quotation marks. You don't need to add any extra characters or formatting. Just type the command exactly as it's written, and press Enter to execute it. It's pretty straightforward! If you have any trouble or need help with a specific command, feel free to ask.",
