    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `getcurrencyconverters` API and I was wondering, can I use it to retrieve all currencies, regardless of their reserve amounts or ratios?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, you can't. The `getcurrencyconverters` API has specific filters in place to only return currencies that meet certain criteria, such as having at least 1000 VRSC in reserve and a reserve ratio greater than 10%. It's not designed to return all currencies, unfortunately.",
