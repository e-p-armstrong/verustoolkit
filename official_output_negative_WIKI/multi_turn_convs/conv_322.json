    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about Verus and its relationship with Komodo. If the community chooses not to use the Komodo notary service, what happens to the stability of the chain tip?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe stability of the chain tip is not affected by the community's decision to use or not use the Komodo notary service. PBaaS chains will always follow their proof of power protocol and lock to their witnessed tips as well. This means that the stability of the chain tip is ensured by the PBaaS chains' own protocol, regardless of the use of the Komodo notary service.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. But, I'm still a bit curious. Can PBaaS chains ever follow a chain tip that is not their witnessed tip?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, PBaaS chains will always follow their proof of power protocol and lock to their witnessed tips. This means that PBaaS chains will never follow a chain tip that is not their witnessed tip. So, you can rest assured that the chain tip stability is maintained through the PBaaS chains' own protocol.",
