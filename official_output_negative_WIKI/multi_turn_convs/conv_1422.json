    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about DeFi protocols and I have a question about Verus. How does Verus DeFi protocol handle miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi protocol actually addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This approach helps to prevent the issues that often arise with MEV and front-running.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also heard that Verus has bridge converter currencies. Do these currencies have limited flexibility compared to other currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies. You can use them just like any other currency on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nI see. How do fees work when using the liquidity pool on a new blockchain? Are they sent back to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool on a new blockchain are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. Instead, there is seamless connectivity between the chains, allowing for easy and efficient transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Finally, I was wondering about launching a new blockchain or bridge. Is it possible to do so without meeting the minimum participation requirements?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, if the minimum levels of worldwide participation in the preferred currencies on-chain are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. This ensures that there is sufficient support and liquidity for the new blockchain or bridge.",
