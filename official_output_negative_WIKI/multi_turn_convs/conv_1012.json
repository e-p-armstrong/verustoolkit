    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with Verus and I'm really excited about its potential. But I have to ask, is this software ready for production use and guaranteed to work without any issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. This software is still experimental and unfinished. It's provided \"AS IS\" and \"without warranty of any kind\", which means there is no guarantee it will work correctly or without issues. Additionally, it's not intended for mainnet use and should only be used with test chains. So, while it's great that you're excited about Verus, it's not yet ready for prime time.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. I was thinking of creating a chain definition with 5 eras. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, I'm afraid not. There is a limit of 3 eras when defining a chain. So, you won't be able to create a chain definition with 5 eras. Maybe you could consider breaking your chain into smaller segments or finding an alternative solution? I'd be happy to help you brainstorm if you need some ideas.",
