    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in launching my own token or currency using Verus. Can you walk me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus is a permissionless platform, which means that you can launch a token, liquidity basket currency, or even an entirely new blockchain economy without needing permission from a central authority. This allows for decentralized and community-driven initiatives, unlike centralized launches that require approval from a single entity. Would you like to know more about the specifics of launching a token or currency on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great, but can I only launch tokens on the Verus mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you're not limited to launching tokens on the Verus mainnet. As an example, Verus was used to launch a token on an old testnet, which was then exported to Ethereum's Goerli testnet using the existing bridge. This flexibility allows for testing and development on various networks before moving to the mainnet. You have the freedom to choose where you want to launch and test your token or currency. Do you have any more questions about launching a token or currency on Verus?",

            "4) **Permissionless Chain, Token, and Liquidity Basket Currency Launches**: Whether you are looking to crowdfund an effort in a manner much like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, sell identities to which you expect to add value or that are sub-IDs of a very cool root ID, or launch an entirely new blockchain economy and blockchain that starts with all of the Verus technology and a bridge to Verus and Ethereum from day 1, Verus is probably the best platform for you. In fact, as we were planning for the next testnet and wanted to have our own version of DAI to use in the bridge, since we want only decentralized currencies in the live mainnet bridge, we used a command to launch a token on the old testnet, exported it and all its supply to Ethereum\u2019s Goerli on the existing bridge, and that will be the DAI proxy/simulant that we will use on the new testnet. It saved us all some time, proving that Verus PBaaS will also be the easiest, most efficient way to launch even an Ethereum ERC20, whether that ERC20 represents a token, DeFi basket, or even another PBaaS blockchain \ud83d\ude42",
