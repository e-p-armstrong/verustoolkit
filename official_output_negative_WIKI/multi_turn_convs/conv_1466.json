    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've downloaded the Verus package and I'm trying to verify it. I was wondering, how can I verify the download using a password instead of a signature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you cannot verify the download using a password instead of a signature. A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is included for each download, and these packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". The verification process involves extracting the downloaded archive, verifying the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extracting the archive to the desired directory.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I understand that. But can I verify the download using any identity instead of \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot verify the download using any identity instead of \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". The packages have been signed with the specific identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\", and the verification process requires using this exact identity to verify the signature.\n\n**User:**\nAlright, I'll make sure to use the correct identity. What happens if the result of the verification command is \"false\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the result is not \"true\", it implies that the signature is not valid, which could indicate a problem with the download or the verification process. In that case, you may want to try re-downloading the package or checking the verification process to ensure everything is correct.",
