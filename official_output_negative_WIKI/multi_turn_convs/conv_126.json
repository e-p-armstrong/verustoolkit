    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to download and run Verus software, but my antivirus software keeps flagging it as a virus. Why do Avast and Kaspersky flag Verus software as a virus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion here. Avast and Kaspersky do not flag Verus software as a virus. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is mining software that might be installed by a third party to exploit the user's PC. This is not an indication that the software is malicious, but rather a warning to the user. It's always a good idea to be cautious when downloading software, but in this case, Verus is a legitimate project.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But how can I be sure that the Verus download I'm getting is authentic and not tampered with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you need to follow these steps: \n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the CLI command `./verus verifyfile` or `./verus verifyhash` to verify the signature. The result will be `true` if the signature is valid. This ensures that the software you're downloading is genuine and hasn't been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nI've also seen some updates to the CLI version. Is it mandatory to upgrade to CLI version v0.7.2-7?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the CLI upgrade v0.7.2-7 is not mandatory. It is a non-mandatory upgrade that includes fixes necessary to continue participating in the current testnet. Mainnet features remain unchanged from v0.7.2-6. So, you can choose to upgrade or stick with the previous version, depending on your needs.",
