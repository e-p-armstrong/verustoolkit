    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating a new blockchain and currency on the Verus mainnet. Can you tell me how to do it without incurring any fees or costs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I need to correct you - it's not possible to create a new blockchain and currency on the Verus mainnet without any fees or costs. According to the Verus protocol, there is a standard protocol fee of 0.01% for conversions, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network. This fee is necessary to incentivize the miners and stakers to secure the network and validate transactions.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was also wondering, can I create a blockchain with more than 3 eras on the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot create a blockchain with more than 3 eras on the Verus testnet. According to the chain definition, there is a maximum of 3 eras allowed.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. Do I need VRSCTEST in my wallet to create a new chain on the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you do need VRSCTEST in your wallet to create a new chain on the Verus testnet. The chain definition specifies that VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet to make a chain.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question - can I launch the mainnet by running the command `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot launch the mainnet by running the command `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST`. This command is used to launch the testnet, not the mainnet.",
