    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm having some trouble with Verus-Desktop. How do I change Verus-Desktop from Lite Mode to Native Mode?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that. To change Verus-Desktop from Lite Mode to Native Mode, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\nFirst, make sure you have the latest version of Verus-Desktop installed. Then, go to the Verus-Desktop settings and click on the \"Mode\" tab. From there, select \"Native\" as your preferred mode.\n\nNext, you'll need to import your Lite wallet address into Verus-Desktop native mode. You can do this by clicking on \"File\" > \"Import\" and selecting the \"Lite wallet\" option. Follow the prompts to complete the import process.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions or encounter any issues, you can refer to the Verus-Desktop user guide, which provides step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting tips.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I was also wondering, is it possible to convert my Native wallet address to a Lite wallet address using the resources provided in the guide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the guide provides a link to import a Lite wallet address in Verus Desktop native mode, not the other way around. It's meant to help you transition from Lite Mode to Native Mode, not vice versa. So, unfortunately, you won't be able to convert your Native wallet address to a Lite wallet address using the guide. But if you have any more questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask!",
