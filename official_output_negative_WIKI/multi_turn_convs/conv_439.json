    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a few more questions about using VerusIDs on the marketplace. Can I sell a VerusID or NFT on the Verus marketplace without any transparency, so that the buyer doesn't know who I am?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus ID and NFT marketplace allows for transactions to be executed in a completely decentralized way, with the option to pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address. This means that you can choose to maintain your privacy while still conducting a secure and auditable transaction. Would you like to know more about buying and selling on the Verus marketplace?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks! I've also heard that if I lock my VerusID with Verus Vault, I won't be able to stake my funds on the Verus network. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. According to the Verus Vault feature, even if you lock your VerusID with Vault, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn rewards by doing so. Additionally, you can still receive funds while your VerusID is locked. So, you can use Verus Vault for security and still participate in staking.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question: Do I need to have multiple identities configured to enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you only need to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured to enable these capabilities. You don't need multiple identities for each feature. This makes it easy to set up and manage your VerusID's security and recovery options.",
