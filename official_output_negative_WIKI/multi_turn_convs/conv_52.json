    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm learning more about Verus and I have a question. How do users create centralized tokens on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, users can create decentralized tokens on Verus, not centralized tokens. With Verus, any user with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain. This allows for decentralized token creation, not centralized. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions?\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What is the minimum percentage of asset backing required for a Verus DeFi fractional basket currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum percentage of asset backing required for a Verus DeFi fractional basket currency is 5%, not a fixed higher percentage. ID owners can define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. Do you have any questions about how that works, or would you like to know more about Verus DeFi?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question I have is, can a new blockchain be launched on Verus without a corresponding liquidity pool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, with Verus, a new blockchain launch is accompanied by a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool as part of defining the new blockchain. This allows for simultaneous blockchain and liquidity pool launches, ensuring a seamless experience for users. Does that answer your question? Do you have any more about Verus or its capabilities?",

The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain.
