    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into Verus and I have a few questions. I was wondering, can you explain why Verus only allows developers to create their own token currencies or blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not the case. Verus does not only allow developers to create their own token currencies or blockchains. In fact, any user with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. This is possible without requiring any programming knowledge. So, it's not limited to developers only.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I was also wondering, how do I integrate my own custom DeFi protocol into the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou don't need to integrate your own custom DeFi protocol into the Verus blockchain. Verus already has a built-in DeFi protocol that enables ID owners to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. This protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. One more question. Can I launch a new blockchain without a liquidity pool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, according to Verus, when you launch a new blockchain, you can also launch a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but are bound to the launch of the new blockchain and run on the new blockchain.",
