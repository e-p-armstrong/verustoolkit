    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST from multiple addresses to a single recipient. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I have to clarify that the `sendcurrency` API only allows sending from a single address or all wallet funds (`*`), not from multiple addresses. For example, you can send from a single address (`bob@`) to a single recipient (`alice@`) or from all wallet funds (`*`) to multiple recipients (`alice@` and `bob@`). Unfortunately, sending from multiple addresses to a single recipient is not supported by the `sendcurrency` API.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a bit of a bummer. I was also wondering if anyone can create a currency with any name they want using the `definecurrency` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, to create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name, and only the controller of that ID can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once. So, it's not a free-for-all where anyone can create a currency with any name they want.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. How do you convert VRSCTEST to a new currency that is already active using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API can be used to convert VRSCTEST to a new currency, but the example provided is actually for preconverting to a new currency before it is active, not for converting to an already active currency. To convert to an already active currency, you would use the `convertto` parameter without the `preconvert` parameter.",
