    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to set up an identity on the Verus network. Do you know how I can register an identity without providing a `namereservation` object?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to register an identity on the Verus network without providing a `namereservation` object. This object is required as part of the `registeridentity` command, and it specifies the name, parent, salt, and referral information for the identity. You can't skip this step, so make sure you have all the necessary information ready.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What about specifying a primary address? Is that required when registering an identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you're required to specify at least one primary address in the `identity` object when registering an identity on the Verus network. This address will be used to receive and send funds related to the identity, so it's a crucial step in the process.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been wondering about creating a custom blockchain on the Verus network. Do I need to write custom code to create an independent, connected, interoperable blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need to write custom code to create an independent, connected, interoperable blockchain on the Verus network. Verus allows for on-chain launches and merge mining of such blockchains without requiring any programming. You can take advantage of Verus's built-in features to create a custom blockchain that meets your needs.",
