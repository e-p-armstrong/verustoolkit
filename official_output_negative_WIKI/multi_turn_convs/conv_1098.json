    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been experimenting with the Verus API and I was wondering, can I use the `sendcurrency` API to send real money to someone on the VRSCTEST network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use the `sendcurrency` API to send real money on the VRSCTEST network. The VRSCTEST network is a testnet, and all coins/currencies on it have no value and will disappear whenever the network is reset. The VRSCTEST network is intended for testing and development purposes only, and it's not meant for actual financial transactions. If you need to send real money, you should use the mainnet instead.",
