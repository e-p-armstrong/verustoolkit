    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating my own currency. Can anyone create a currency with any name they want, as long as they have the necessary funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot exactly. To create a currency of a specific name, you need to have an ID of the same name, and the controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name. They can only do so once, too. So, it's not just a matter of having the necessary funds, but also having control of the corresponding ID.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, let's say I do have control of the ID I want to use for my currency. Can I launch a currency without funding the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't launch a currency without funding the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. This is a requirement for launching a currency. Additionally, you need to have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And what about creating new tokens? Is it possible to create new tokens through decentralized issuance options?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible to create new tokens through decentralized issuance options. At present, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option.",
