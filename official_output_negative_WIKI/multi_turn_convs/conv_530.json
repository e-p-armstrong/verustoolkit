    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm planning to launch a new currency on the Verus network, but I'm not sure about the requirements. Can you explain why I need to fund my currency with 100 VRSCTEST before launching it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, it's not 100 VRSCTEST, but rather at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch. Additionally, the currency must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. Do you have any questions about this process or would you like more information on launching a currency on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I've got another question. How do I convert VRSCTEST to GOLD after the GOLD token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you can issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches, at which point, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about the conversion process?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Is it possible to create new tokens in a decentralized manner after the GOLD token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. After the GOLD token launches, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. Decentralized token creation is not possible after the GOLD token launch. Do you have any more questions about token creation or Verus in general?",
