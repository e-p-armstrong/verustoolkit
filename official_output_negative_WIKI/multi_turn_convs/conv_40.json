    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard that VerusIDs are vulnerable to the 5-dollar wrench attack. Is that true? How do VerusIDs prevent this attack?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, VerusIDs can be revoked and recovered by their revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. This allows for a decentralized solution to the 5-dollar wrench attack. For example, setting a 24-hour unlock delay on a locked ID provides a safeguard against unauthorized access, as the revocation authority can revoke and recover the ID if an unauthorized unlock occurs. So, VerusIDs are not vulnerable to the 5-dollar wrench attack.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been told that Verus Vault provides less security for IDs and NFTs compared to other solutions. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Verus Vault actually provides the same level of security for IDs and NFTs as it does for funds, which is a high level of protection. It offers a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, including time locks for various purposes such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This means that Verus Vault provides strong security for all your assets, including IDs and NFTs.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. Is it possible to export an ID to a PBaaS chain without using the `exportid` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `exportid` command is required to export an ID to a PBaaS chain. The correct command to do this is:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nThe `exportid` command is necessary to specify that the ID should be exported to the PBaaS chain.",

            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.
