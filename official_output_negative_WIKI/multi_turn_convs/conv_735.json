    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still trying to understand how Verus conversions work. Do they not involve mining and staking in the consensus protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus conversions do involve mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol. All DeFi AMM conversions are verified via mining and staking, which ensures that all conversions in a single liquidity basket are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block, resulting in the same price for all participants in all directions of conversion.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I was under the impression that currencies and identities on Verus were not primitives at L1, but rather, were validated and verified through some other means.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, currencies and identities on Verus are indeed primitives at L1, and they are validated and verified on UTXO transactions. These UTXO transactions check all inputs and outputs, similar to how single-currency L1 blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin check the native currency inputs and outputs of transactions.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, can currencies on Verus only be sent within the Verus network, or can they be sent to other networks like Ethereum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, currencies on Verus can be sent back and forth to other multi-currency capable networks, including other independent PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s. This allows for seamless interaction and transfer of value between different blockchain networks.\n\n**User:**\nAnd finally, I was wondering about \"mapped currencies\" on Verus. Are they not 1:1 mappings to existing currencies on Ethereum, but rather some other type of relationship?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, \"mapped currencies\" on Verus are indeed 1:1 mappings to existing currencies on Ethereum. For example, a \"mapped currency\" could map 1:1 to an existing currency like DAI on Ethereum, allowing for easy transfer and use of the new \"mapped currency\" on Verus, or sending it back to Ethereum and using it as the original currency.",
