    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing some rumors about the notification oracle technology causing issues on the Verus network. Is it true that it caused all Verus network functions to be disabled?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not entirely accurate. The notification oracle technology did not cause all Verus network functions to be disabled. In fact, it only selectively disallowed cross-chain operations, while leaving same-chain operations unaffected. This means that all functions on the Verus network, except for launching PBaaS chains or Ethereum bridges, are fully functional and unhampered.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. What happens if someone tries to launch a PBaaS chain while the oracle notification is active?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf someone tries to launch a PBaaS chain while the oracle notification is active, all nodes following the oracle will reject such an action without incident until the notification is removed. This means that the launch attempt will be prevented, but it will not cause any issues or incidents on the network.\n\n**User:**\nI've been putting off upgrading to v1.0.5, is it safe to delay the upgrade since the network will not be affected?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI would not recommend delaying the upgrade to v1.0.5 indefinitely. Although the network will not be affected immediately, it will become incompatible with Verus versions prior to 1.0.5 once the notification is removed and someone launches a PBaaS chain that issues a cross-chain challenge. Although there is a suggested deadline of Monday, May 29th, at 19:00 UTC to upgrade, it is still important to upgrade as soon as possible to avoid any potential issues. It's better to be safe than sorry!",

This means that all functions on the Verus network, except for launching PBaaS chains or Ethereum bridges, are fully functional and unhampered.",
            "Because we have the notification oracle technology, we triggered a rip-cord notification selectively for cross-chain that made all nodes listening to the oracle, which we expect to be near 100%, disallow cross-chain operations without affecting same chain operations. That means that all functions on the Verus network, except launching PBaaS chains or Ethereum bridges are fully functional and unhampered in any way at this time. If someone tries to launch a PBaaS chain while this oracle notification is active, all nodes following the oracle will reject such an action without incident until the notification is removed.This release, v1.0.5, properly calculates the aptly named \u201cmagic number\u201d for each chain, in the correct way on the mainnet network, and as long as the notification is set, is fully compatible with current versions on the network.Once everyone has had a chance to upgrade to v1.0.5, the network/community should agree to remove the notification from the oracle and allow PBaaS launches without false rejection of cross-chain challenges. Once we do that, and when someone launches a PBaaS chain that issues such a challenge, the network would become incompatible with Verus versions prior to 1.0.5.From our perspective, we are not aware of urgent efforts to launch a PBaaS chain in the next few days by anyone who cannot wait. All things considered, we believe that we can at least wait until the community discussion on Saturday, and that a strawman deadline would be **Monday, May 29th, at 19:00 UTC** for everyone to have upgraded. If you are urgently wanting to launch a PBaaS chain, have a plan, and are prepared to do so sooner, we invite you to join the community meeting on Saturday at 19:00 UTC and let everyone know.",
