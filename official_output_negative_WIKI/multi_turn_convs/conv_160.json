    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient. I was wondering if you could explain how to do it without specifying the amount to be sent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `sendcurrency` API does require specifying the amount to be sent. You can't leave it out. For example, to send VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@), you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nAs you can see, the amount (10 in this case) is explicitly specified in the command. Unfortunately, it's not possible to use the `sendcurrency` API without specifying the amount.",
