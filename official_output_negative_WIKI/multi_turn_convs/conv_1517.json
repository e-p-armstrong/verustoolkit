    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have a few more questions about Verus and PBaaS chains. Is it possible to use the same named currencies as a PBaaS chain if they are already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, it is not possible to use the same named currencies as a PBaaS chain if they are already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH. This is because of a current limitation in the testnet release, which will be addressed before mainnet availability. You'll have to wait a bit longer for that feature.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for letting me know. I also have a question about the software itself. Is the software provided with a warranty that guarantees it will work without any issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. So, you'll need to use it at your own risk.",
