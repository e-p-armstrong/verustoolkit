    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm thinking of downloading the Verus software, but I'm a bit concerned about viruses. Will I be safe from viruses if I download the Verus software from the provided links?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI completely understand your concern! The links provided are actually VirusTotal scan results, which show that some antivirus software might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software includes mining capabilities, which might be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, this does not mean the software is malicious or contains viruses. It's essential to review the resources provided to understand the false positives. You can rest assured that the software is safe to download and use.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks! I've also been wondering, is Verus ID a centralized digital identity system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus ID is not a centralized digital identity system. It is a fully decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity system that will disrupt today's centralized systems. VerusIDs are designed to give you complete control over your digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**User:**\nI'm currently using the RC2 version of Verus. Will I be able to use this version on the mainnet after the network activation on December 15th?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the current version (RC2) is a release candidate, and while it's considered fully ready for testing, it's not an official release. You should upgrade to an official release before the network activation on December 15th, which is expected to happen at block 800200. It's essential to upgrade to ensure a smooth transition to the mainnet.",
