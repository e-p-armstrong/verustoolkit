    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some Verus configuration options I'm trying to understand. Can you help me out? Specifically, what does the OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER option do when set to 0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER option is not set to 0. When not set on a gateway, top-level ID and currency registration happen on the launch chain. So, it's not about setting it to 0, but rather about whether it's set or not. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I've also got a question about the OPTION_NFT_TOKEN option. Does it create a multi-satoshi NFT token?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the OPTION_NFT_TOKEN option creates a single satoshi NFT token, which tokenizes control over the root ID. So, it's a single satoshi token, not a multi-satoshi one. Do you have any more questions about these options or Verus configuration in general?",
