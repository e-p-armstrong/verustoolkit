    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been using the `getreceivedbyaccount` command to get the total amount received by an account, but I'm not sure if it's still valid. Is the `getreceivedbyaccount` command still a valid and recommended way to get the total amount received by an account?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, the `getreceivedbyaccount` command is deprecated, which means it's no longer recommended for use. It's still present in the documentation for reference, but it's not the best choice for getting the total amount received by an account. You should consider using alternative methods instead.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I was also wondering about the \"account\" argument in the `getnewaddress` and `getreceivedbyaccount` commands. Can I pass any string as the \"account\" argument to these commands?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't pass just any string as the \"account\" argument to these commands. In both cases, the \"account\" argument MUST be set to the empty string \"\" to represent the default account. Passing any other string will result in an error. You need to be careful with the input to avoid issues.",
