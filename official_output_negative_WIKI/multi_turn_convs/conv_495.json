    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a few more questions about VerusIDs and currencies on the Verus blockchain. Can IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies launch their own currencies on the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch their own currencies on the Verus blockchain. Only Native IDs, registered directly from a blockchain, can launch currencies. IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies can still be valuable for other purposes, such as revocation and recovery IDs, personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses, and more. Do you have any other questions about VerusIDs and currencies?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I was thinking about the Ethereum bridge converter. Are *.veth gateway IDs not available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's incorrect. *.veth gateway IDs are available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter, and they can even create Ethereum-mapped currencies. The registration of .veth IDs is priced to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity. It's a great way to connect your Ethereum assets to the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question about the fees for registering .veth IDs. Do all fees for registering .veth IDs go to the mining and staking fee pool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. All fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool, go to the bridge converter liquidity basket. This helps to maintain the health and liquidity of the bridge, making it easier for users to move assets between chains.",
