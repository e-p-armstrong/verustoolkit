    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a question about launching a PbaaS chain. Can I use the `refundfailedlaunch` command to refund contributions made to a successful PbaaS chain launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `refundfailedlaunch` command is specifically designed to refund contributions made to a **failed** PbaaS chain launch, not a successful one. The correct command for this scenario is:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME\n```\nYou should only use `refundfailedlaunch` when a chain launch has failed, not when it has been successful.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I also had a question about the software itself. Is this software guaranteed to work without any issues or damages?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. There is no guarantee that it will work without any issues or damages. In fact, the disclaimer explicitly states that the authors or copyright holders will not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software. It's essential to understand that you use the software at your own risk, and you should take necessary precautions to ensure your digital assets are secure.",
