    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been using Verus for a while now, and I was wondering about the warranty on the software. What kind of warranty does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software does not come with any warranty, express or implied. It is provided \"as is\", without any guarantees or promises of performance, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This means that you use the software at your own risk, and we don't provide any warranty or guarantee.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. What happens if I encounter any issues or damages while using the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. This means that you use the software at your own risk, and you cannot hold the authors or copyright holders responsible for any issues or damages that may occur. We're not responsible for any problems that might arise, so please be careful when using the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've noticed that sometimes Avast and Kaspersky flag the software as malware. Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Avast and Kaspersky do not necessarily flag the software as malware. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is a mining program that could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not actually malware. It's just a precautionary measure taken by the antivirus software, but rest assured that our software is safe to use.",
