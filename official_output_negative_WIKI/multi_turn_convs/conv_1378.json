    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating a currency with Verus. Can I create a currency with any name I want, without needing an ID of the same name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no. To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. So, if you want to create a currency with a specific name, you'll need to have an ID with that same name.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, can anyone create a currency of a specific name, not just the controller of the ID with the same name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, only the controller of the ID with the same name can create a currency of that specific name. So, if you want to create a currency with a certain name, you'll need to be the controller of the ID with that same name.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And what about after a currency is launched? Can anyone create new tokens of that currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, after a currency is launched, only a centralized issuance option is available to create new tokens of that currency. So, once a currency is created, only the designated central authority can create new tokens of that currency.",

The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTES",
