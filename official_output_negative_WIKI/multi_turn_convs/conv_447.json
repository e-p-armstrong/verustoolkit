    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I need some help with sending VRSCTEST. How do I send VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@) using the `sendcurrency` API, but also convert it to BTC in the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@), you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nHowever, if you want to convert VRSCTEST to BTC, you would need to use a different command. Converting VRSCTEST to BTC requires a separate step, and you can't do it directly while sending funds from one address to another.\n\nFor example, you could use a command like this to convert VRSCTEST to BTC:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions about these commands or need further assistance!\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I have another question. Do testnet coins/currencies have value and will they persist even after VRSCTEST is reset?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. The testnet is meant for testing and development purposes, and the coins used on it are not meant to have any real value. They are simply a tool to help developers and users test the functionality of the Verus network. So, don't worry about losing any value when the testnet is reset!",
