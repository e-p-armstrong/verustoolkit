    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `zcrawkeygen` command to send and receive confidential values on the blockchain. How do I do it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to help! However, I have to clarify that the `zcrawkeygen` command is actually deprecated. It only generates a zcaddr, zcsecretkey, and zcviewingkey, but it doesn't allow you to send and receive confidential values on the blockchain. The output of `zcrawkeygen` is a JSON object containing these three keys, but it doesn't provide a means to perform transactions.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the `zcrawreceive` command? How does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `zcrawreceive` command is also deprecated, I'm afraid. It doesn't encrypt notes, but instead decrypts an encrypted note and checks if the coin commitments are in the blockchain. The output of `zcrawreceive` is a JSON object containing the decrypted amount, note plaintext, and an \"exists\" result indicating whether the coin commitments are in the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nI'm still trying to figure out how to send confidential payments on the blockchain. Can I use the `zcsamplejoinsplit` command to do it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the `zcsamplejoinsplit` command doesn't send confidential payments on the blockchain either. It performs a joinsplit and returns a JSDescription. The note about delivering confidential payments in-band on the blockchain refers to a future RPC call, not the `zcsamplejoinsplit` command. I apologize for any confusion. If you have any more questions or need help with something else, feel free to ask!",
