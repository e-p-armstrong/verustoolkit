    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've got some questions about the recent update to VerusIDs. How does it affect Coinbase shielding, which I thought was required for all coinbases from the past that have not yet been shielded?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the update has changed that. Coinbase shielding is no longer required for any coinbases from the past that have not yet been shielded. This means that all unshielded coinbases from the past are now shielded by default.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great news! I also had a question about using IDs for staking. Can IDs still be used only for storing funds, but not for staking, after the update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. With the update, IDs can now be used for both storing and staking funds. Staking will work on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds.\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `updateidentity` command, and I was wondering how it works with regards to changing the case of characters in a VerusID name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `updateidentity` command can now change the case of characters in the name of a VerusID, but only in the global locale.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to the revocation identity after an ID is revoked? Does it still have any control over the revoked ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter an ID is revoked, the revocation identity will lose all control over the revoked ID, including the ability to still change the revocation identity itself, which it used to retain. The recovery identity will now have full control over the revoked ID.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I was wondering about the stability of the Verus software. Is it fully tested and stable, with a warranty for any kind of damage?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and it's used at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage.",
