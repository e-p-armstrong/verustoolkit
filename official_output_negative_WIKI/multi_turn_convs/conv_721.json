    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a token, centralized currency, or liquidity basket AMM on the Verus network. Can you walk me through how to launch these features off-chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can't launch these features off-chain on the Verus network. Verus has added capabilities for on-chain launches of token, centralized currency, and liquidity basket AMMs. This means that these features are launched directly on the Verus blockchain, not off-chain. Would you like more information on how to launch these features on-chain?\n\n**User:**\nI see. Another question I had is, is it possible to program independent, connected, interoperable blockchains on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not necessary to program these blockchains on the Verus network. Verus has added the capability for on-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming. This means that you can easily create and connect blockchains without needing to write custom code.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about buying and selling VerusIDs and NFTs on the Verus network. Can I do this through a centralized intermediary?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs through a centralized intermediary on the Verus network. You can buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, executing transactions in a completely decentralized way, without any intermediary necessary. You can advertise your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. This way, you have full control over the transaction and don't need to rely on a middleman.",
