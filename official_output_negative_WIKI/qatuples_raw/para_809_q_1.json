    "Why are Avast and Kaspersky flagging the software as malware?",
    "Avast and Kaspersky are not flagging the software as malware. They are flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is mining software that may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive detection, and the software is not actually malware.",
