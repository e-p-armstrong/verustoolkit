    "Can you explain why you need to wait only 10 blocks after receiving the coinbases before being able to move them?",
    "You actually need to wait 100 blocks (minutes) after receiving the coinbases before being able to move them, not 10 blocks. This is because the coinbases are mined coins that are not yet staking, and the protocol requires a certain number of blocks to be mined before they can be spent.",
