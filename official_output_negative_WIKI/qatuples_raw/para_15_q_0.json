    "What is the error message I'll get if I've already installed the necessary libraries when running `./verusd` on a Linux distro?",
    "The error messages mentioned are actually indicators that the necessary libraries are not installed. If you've already installed the necessary libraries, you shouldn't receive these error messages. The error messages `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` and `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory` are specifically indicating that the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries are not installed.",
    "# error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory\n# error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory\n\nWhen running `./verusd` on a Linux distro (eg Debian or Devuan), not all dependencies may be installed by default, resulting in the errormessage `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` or `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory`.\n\nTo solve this you need to install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries:\n`sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`\n\nSolution supplied by: Oink.vrsc@\n\nNote: revision date 2021-12-01.",
