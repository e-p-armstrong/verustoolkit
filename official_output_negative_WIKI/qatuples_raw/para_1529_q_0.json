    "Can you explain why upgrading to a quantum secure address will only secure the latest 100 transactions sent to my identity name/address?",
    "Actually, upgrading to a quantum secure address will retroactively secure **all** transactions sent to your identity name/address, not just the latest 100. This means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity, the upgrade will secure all 1000 of them.",
    "s as well. That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.",
