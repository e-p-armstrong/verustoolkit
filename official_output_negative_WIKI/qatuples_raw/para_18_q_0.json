    "Why do you need to use backslashes (`\\`) instead of double quotes (`\"`) when formatting commands on the Windows command line?",
    "That's not correct. When formatting commands on the Windows command line, you need to substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character, and substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters. This is because the Windows command prompt (`cmd.com`) has different formatting requirements than Linux and MacOS.",
    "# Remarks on Windows command line formatting:\n\nThe CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS. On the native windows command prompt (`cmd.com`) the formatting is different.\n\n* For windows substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character.\n * For windows substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters.\n\nNote: this only applies to giving commands from the windows command prompt. Verus Desktop will accept commands as listed.\n\nCreated by Oink.vrsc@\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-03-02.",
