    "Can I use the `verus` command without replacing `<userinput>` with my specific userdata?",
    "No, you need to replace `<userinput>` with your specific userdata when using the `verus` command. For example, if the text directs you to use `\"<Public Address>\"`, you should replace that with your actual public address, including the quotes.",
    "# Question: I followed the procedure and am still having problems with my wallet.To completely reset your wallet in the event of a fork, particularly if you've already followed [this procedure](#!faq-allos/faq-allos19_what_should_i_do_if_i_end_up_on_my_own_fork_because_of_a_network_issue_or_having_an_old_version_of_the_wallet.md), follow the steps below.### Verus `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata & `VRSC.conf` standard locations\n * Linux:\t\t`~/.komodo/VRSC`\n * Mac OS: \t`~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`\n * Windows 10: \t`%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`\n * OS independent through Verus Desktop: Click `help`, `Show Verus data folder (default)`### Important General Information`verus command \"<userinput>\"` needs to be entered literally, with `<userinput>` replaced by your specific userdata. So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address,\nso it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`.## Procedure\n1. Open your `VRSC.conf` file for editing.\n2. Add a line to `VRSC.conf` containing\n (mac or linux)\n `exportdir=/home/<username>/`\n (or on windows)\n `exportdir=c:\\Users<username>\\Desktop\\`\n3. Save the file and stop verusd for Windows-Desktop or Agama, just exit and wait for it to close completely. For the linux cli run `./verus stop`, or for the windows cli run `verus stop`.\n4. Once your wallet is finished closing make a backup of your `wallet.dat` file somewhere safe. `wallet.dat` is located in the same directory as your configuration file (see above). To make the backup just copy it to another directory, make sure to leave the original there for the time being.\n5. Now restart your wallet by launching Verus Desktop, Agama or running verusd for the CLI.\n6. Now we'll export the wallet (this produces a different kind of file from what we did above).",
