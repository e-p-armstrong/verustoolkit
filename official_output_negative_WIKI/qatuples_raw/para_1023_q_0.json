    "Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag Verus software as malware or viruses?",
    "Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), but this is not because Verus software is malware or a virus. Instead, these warnings are triggered because Verus is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about these false positives.",
