    "Why does the Verus Coin Foundation recommend installing antivirus software from Avast and Kaspersky to ensure safe downloads?",
    "The Verus Coin Foundation does not recommend installing antivirus software from Avast and Kaspersky to ensure safe downloads. In fact, the text states that Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program), which is a warning that the software may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. The Verus Coin Foundation provides a way to verify the downloads using a signature and checksum to ensure their authenticity.",
