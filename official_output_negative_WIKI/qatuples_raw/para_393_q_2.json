    "Why do Avast and Kaspersky flag the software as a virus?",
    "Avast and Kaspersky do not flag the software as a virus. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program), which is a warning that the software is mining software that may be installed by a third party to exploit the user's PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not actually malware.",
