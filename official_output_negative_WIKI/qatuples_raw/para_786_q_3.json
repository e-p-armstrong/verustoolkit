    "Can I use any type of ID to create a new currency with unlimited supply in this release?",
    "No, in this release, you can use any type of ID or sub-ID to create a new kind of currency, but it will always have a 1 Satoshi supply, not unlimited supply. This type of currency is called tokenized ID control and gives the holder power over the ID that issued it.",
    "This release fixes a mainnet issue that may, in rare cases, cause a node to deadlock.\nIt also adds the following new features to mainnet:\n- Auto TLS encrypted connections between nodes on mainnet and testnet, no action needed, but you can require that all connections be encrypted by starting the daemon with \u201c-tlsenforcement\u201d.\n- A new \u201c-idindex\u201d flag that enables 3 new APIs to lookup identities by their primary addresses or revocation and recovery addresses, `getidentitywithaddress`, `getidentitywithrevocation`, and `getidentitywithrecovery`.\n Generally improved multithreading within the daemon.\n- These improvements allow anyone to now write applications to easily graph or display public relationships between identities, transparent addresses, and transactions without compromising the privacy of private addresses, messages, or transactions between identities using name@:private endpoints, z-addresses or communicating via off-chain channels.For testnet, this is RC2 of the PBaaS protocol and has some significant and important advances and changes. In addition to a great deal of progress hardening for mainnet, v0.9.4 introduces the following new features to the PBaaS testnet:\n- All features above for mainnet\n- NFT mapped tokens and tokenized ID control - In v0.9.4, as with v0.9.3, you can use root identities to create any kind of currencies, *.veth IDs to create Ethereum mapped currencies, and what is new in v0.9.4 is that you can now use any type of ID or sub-ID to create a new kind of currency that will always have a 1 Satoshi supply and enable anyone holding it to have power over the ID that issued it. This type of currency is called tokenized ID control and can be treated like a super NFT over all copies of the source ID on all chains that were exported to other chains after the currency was created. Once the Ethereum contracts are upgraded with this capability, *.ve",
