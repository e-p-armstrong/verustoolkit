    "How do I backup my wallet by simply copying the `wallet.dat` file?",
    "You cannot backup your wallet by simply copying the `wallet.dat` file. While the `wallet.dat` file is an important part of your wallet, it's not the recommended way to backup your wallet. The preferred method is to export your wallet using the `Export native wallet backup` option in Verus Desktop or the `z_exportwallet` command in the CLI. This will create a complete backup of your wallet, including your plaintext private keys.",
