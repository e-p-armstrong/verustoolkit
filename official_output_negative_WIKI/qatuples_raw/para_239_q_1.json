    "Can I use the `importaddress` command to spend funds from an address?",
    "No, you cannot use the `importaddress` command to spend funds from an address. The `importaddress` command adds an address or script that can be watched as if it were in your wallet, but it cannot be used to spend funds. It's meant to monitor the address, not to control its funds.",
