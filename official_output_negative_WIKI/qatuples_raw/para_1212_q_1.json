    "How do you set the `proofprotocol` to PROOF_CURRENCYID when defining a new currency?",
    "According to the text, setting `proofprotocol` to 2 means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins, which is actually PROOF_CHAINID, not PROOF_CURRENCYID. There is no information about how to set it to PROOF_CURRENCYID because it's not mentioned in the text.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
