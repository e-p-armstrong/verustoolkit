    "How do I send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the `sendcurrency` API, and convert it to a reserve currency like USD at the same time?",
    "You can't convert VRSCTEST to a reserve currency like USD directly when sending it from a single address to a single recipient. However, you can send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the `sendcurrency` API, and then convert it to a fractional basket currency, like VRSC-BTC, which can later be converted to a reserve currency like BTC.\n\nHere's an example of sending VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nAnd here's an example of converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```",
