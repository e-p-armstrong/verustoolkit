    "Can I still login as Root User after setting `PermitRootLogin` to `yes` in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file?",
    "No, you shouldn't be able to login as Root User if you set `PermitRootLogin` to `no` in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file. Setting it to `no` disables root login, which is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to your system. If you set it to `yes`, then you would be able to login as Root User, but this is not recommended for security reasons.",
    "Disable login with Root User\n(make sure your newly created user login works and has sudo rights)\n `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`\nFind: PermitRootLogin yes\nAnd set to\nPermitRootLogin no\nApply new settings:\n `sudo systemctl restart sshd`\n\n(submitted by @karero, corrected by @Glennp, edited by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nNote: last revision date 2022-08-19.",
