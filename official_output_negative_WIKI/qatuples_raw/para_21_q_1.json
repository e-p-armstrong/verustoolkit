    "How can I use the formula to guarantee that I'll find a block within a certain timeframe?",
    "You can't. The formula calculates the average time to find a block, not a guaranteed timeframe. It's a statistical estimation based on the network hashrate, local hashrate, and block time. Mining is a probabilistic process, and there's always an element of luck involved.",
    "[gimmick: math]()\n\n# Question: I'm mining since XYZ with XYZ, why I haven't found a block yet?\n\n$$ Average Time To Find One Block = ( \\frac{NetworkHashrate}{LocalHashrate} ) * BlockTime $$\n\nOne block = 6 coins (as now)\nNetworkHashrate = retrieved by `getmininginfo` command from </>CLI\nLocalHashrate = retrieved by `getmininginfo` command\nBlockTime = 60 seconds (average)\nnote: The above formula assumes you are already mining and your hashrate is already included in the `NetworkHashrate`. For very large LocalHashrate calculations (what-if-I-had scenario) add it to the NetworkHashrate yourself.\n\nReal example with - 31 threads AMD Ryzen 5950x @ 4.4Ghz -\n\n$$ Average Time To Find One Block = ( \\frac{851125882237}{46159950} ) * 60 $$\n$$ Average Time To Find One Block = 1,106,317 seconds (307 hours or little under 13 days) $$\n\nBear in mind that these are average times to find a block. In real life you may hit a block much sooner or later after finding the last. In the long run it averages out to the values predicted.\n\n(submitted by @TexWiller, edited by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nnote: last revision date 2023-06-21",
