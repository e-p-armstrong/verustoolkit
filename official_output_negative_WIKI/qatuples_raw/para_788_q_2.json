    "Yes, the RC1 cross-chain witness and notarization protocol was enhanced in RC2. The enhancement includes requiring notarizations to be posted publicly before being confirmed, allowing notaries to recognize and potentially prove invalidity of signatures made with stolen keys.",
    "- Bridgekeeper is now available for permissionless bridge notarization and selectable in the GUI on the mining page. For CLI, we will make a Node application available for testing in the next few days.\n- RC1 cross-chain witness and notarization protocol enhanced in RC2 as follows:\n - In RC2, any notarization to be confirmed must be first posted publicly to allow for potential to prove invalidity, and then later confirmed. In the prior protocol, a witnessed notarization could be posted to a chain and accepted when first seen. Upon analysis and discussion with @allbits and others, we realized that the attack vector of even stolen notary/witness keys combined with an in-secret 51% combined hash/stake attack could be prevented if we changed the protocol to first require posting the ready to finalize data and allow notaries who recognize that there is a signature on chain for something they don\u2019t agree with (likely stolen key), to simpl",
