    "How do I shield my Verus coins using the Verus GUI wallet?",
    "The text does not mention using a GUI wallet to shield Verus coins. Instead, it provides instructions on how to shield coins using the Command-Line Interface (CLI) wallet. To shield coins, you need to use the `verus` command with specific options, such as `z_shieldcoinbase`, and provide your z-addr as an argument.",
    "# Shielding Verus Coin via the CLI.Attention: Read it completely before use.Note: Shielding is no longer required for coinbase rewards after block 800200. Earlier timelocked coins will still need to be shielded in order to use them.### Important General Information`verus command \"<userinput>\"` needs to be entered literally, with `<userinput>` replaced by your specific userdata. So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address,\nso it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`.#### General remarks on CLI wallet:On Windows command line enter the commands as shown without the surrounding quotation marks\nIn Linux shell preceed the commands without surrounding quotation marks with `./`\nIn MacOS shell preceed the commands without surrounding quotation marks with `./`\nExample: the windows version `verus listtransactions` transforms in Linux or MacOS to `./verus listtransactions`.#### General remarks on Windows command line formatting:The CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS.\nFor windows substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character.\nFor windows substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters.## Procedure:You must first \"shield coins\" (send from a transparent R-addr to a shielded zaddr) to be able to use them in staking, when they first unlock.\nThis is part of the Zcash protocol itself. The commands below assume you are in the Verus source code directory`verus z_shieldcoinbase`You can either use an existing zaddr or use a new zaddr. To make a new zaddr:`verus z_getnewaddress`Use the address the above command outputs in the `z_shieldcoinbase` commandTo shield all coinbase in your wallet, you can use `\"*\"` (quotes are important) and zaddr that is getting the funds:`verus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\" <YOUR zs-ADDRESS>`",
