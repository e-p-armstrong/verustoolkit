    "Does Verus only support on-chain launches of Token AMMs?",
    "No, Verus supports more than just on-chain launches of Token AMMs. According to the text, Verus also supports on-chain launches of Centralized Currency and Liquidity Basket AMMs, as well as other capabilities such as on-chain launches and merge mining of independent blockchains, on-chain self-sovereign identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles.",
    "The good news is that since we have the new Verus Notification Oracle technology, we can enable everyone running on the current testnet to remain connected as all cross-chain transactions to and from PBaaS chains will resume flowing. We are still seeing an error in BridgeKeeper, but since this release includes a mainnet security update and addresses all other known issues on testnet, we\u2019ll release this immediately and update Bridgekeeper as soon as possible. In order to merge mine PBaaS chains with Verus or the Ethereum bridge to Goerli going forward, you will need to update to v0.9.9-2, which everyone should run for mainnet anyhow.Once you update, please feel free to resume merge mining all PBaaS chains and Verus. You will need to wait for the BridgeKeeper update to be able to merge mine and stake with Ethereum\u2019s Goerli.Thanks for all your testing! We\u2019ve learned a great deal from this upgrade, and although it may feel like a delay that we took the time to learn and address it in place on the public network before moving on, this learning and consequent hardening will ensure the mainnet release will be more hardened than ever. Next steps are to upgrade auto notarization to be resilient to anything like this level of buildup over weeks automatically and prepare the mainnet release. Join us in testing everything in the #pbaas-development channel. Contribute as you learn and build, and let's all make history together!\n### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
