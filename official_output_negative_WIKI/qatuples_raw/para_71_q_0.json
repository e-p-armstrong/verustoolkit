    "What is the mining algorithm used by VerusCoin, and is it vulnerable to 51% attacks?",
    "The mining algorithm used by VerusCoin is VerusHash 2.1, which is a PoW/PoS 50/50 algorithm. This algorithm is designed to be CPU targeted, non-discriminatory, and CPU/FPGA equalizing. Moreover, it's **Proof of Power**, which makes it 51% attack resistant.",
