    "Can you explain why you need to set `proofprotocol` to 1 to allow anyone to mint new coins in \"mycoin\"?",
    "The text doesn't mention setting `proofprotocol` to 1 to allow anyone to mint new coins. In fact, it says that setting `proofprotocol` to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID) allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. There is no mention of setting `proofprotocol` to 1 or its effects.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
