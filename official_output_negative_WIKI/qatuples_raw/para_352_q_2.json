    "What is the command to define a new currency with a `proofprotocol` of 3?",
    "There is no information about a `proofprotocol` of 3 in the provided text. The text only mentions `proofprotocol` set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID, and explains its implications. There is no mention of a `proofprotocol` of 3 or its effects.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
