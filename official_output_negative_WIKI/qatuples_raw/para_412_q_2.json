    "Can I extract the archive to any directory without verifying the signature first?",
    "No, you should not extract the archive to any directory without verifying the signature first. The instructions explicitly state to extract the downloaded archive, then verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and only then extract the archive to the desired directory. This is a security measure to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the download.",
