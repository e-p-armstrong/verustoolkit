    "Can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies, regardless of their reserve ratio or amount?",
    "No, the `getcurrencyconverters` API is designed to filter currencies based on specific criteria. It only retrieves currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It does not return all currencies, regardless of their reserve ratio or amount.",
