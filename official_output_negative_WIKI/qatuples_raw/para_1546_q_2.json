    "Are Avast and Kaspersky flagging the Verus software as a virus?",
    "No, Avast and Kaspersky are not flagging the Verus software as a virus. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that you are installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. These warnings are false positives.",

These are warnings that you are installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC.\nTo find out more about the false positives, review the following resources:\nhttps://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/\nhttps://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/\n# IMPORTANT SECURITY/PRIVACY UPDATE\nThis update incorporates a fix for the Zcash protocol issue described in: https://z.cash/support/security/announcements/security-announcement-2019-09-24/In addition, this version also includes updates to Sapling functionality, including the Sprout to Sapling migration APIs added to the Zcash protocol up to and including version 2.0.7-3 of Zcash. The issue fixed by this update does not expose any funds to theft or counterfeit, but it does fix a vulnerability that an attacker may exploit to probe for information regarding a specific node's control over private keys. Since the issue resolved does not put funds directly at risk, this update is considered CRITICAL, not mandatory. We recommended that all users upgrade to this version of the Verus CLI or GUI wallet immediately and discontinue use of previous wallets.# Notable Changes\n- Integrated Zcash updates from Sapling release to 2.0.7-3\n- Added Sprout to Sapling upgrade API\n- Including support for PBaaS multi-chain test network with permissionless blockchain launches, reserve currency conversion protocols, merge mining, and easy cross-chain transactions.",
