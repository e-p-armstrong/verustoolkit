    "What is the purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to 1 in the `definecurrency` command for \"mycoin\"?",
    "The `proofprotocol` is actually set to 2, not 1, and it means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. Setting `proofprotocol` to 2 sets it to PROOF_CHAINID, allowing the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
