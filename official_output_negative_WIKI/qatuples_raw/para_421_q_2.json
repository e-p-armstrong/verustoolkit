    "Can I use the Verus API to retrieve all currencies that have exactly one listed currency as a reserve?",
    "No, the Verus API only retrieves currencies that have all listed currencies as reserves, not just one. The correct command to retrieve currencies with BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold is:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis command will return all currencies that meet the conditions specified in the API, including having all listed currencies as reserves.",
    "verters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nWill return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
