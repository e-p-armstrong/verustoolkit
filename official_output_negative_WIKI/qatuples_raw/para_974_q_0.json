    "How do I use the `setidentitytimelock` command to lock an ID forever?",
    "You can't lock an ID forever using the `setidentitytimelock` command. The command allows you to set a time unlock delay, set a lock until a specific block height, or unlock a delayed timelock on a VerusID under your control. You can specify a block height to lock the ID until that block is reached, but you can't lock it forever.",
    "## New Command and API for Verus Vault - setidentitytimelock\nv0.9.0-2 introduced a new command and RPC API, \"setidentitytimelock\". setidentitytimelock may be used to set a time unlock delay, set a lock until a specific block height, or unlock a delayed timelock on a VerusID under your control.You can use setidentitytimelock in one of two ways:\n```\nverus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":1796500}' (returntx)\n```\nor\n```\nverus setidentitytimelock '{\"setunlockdelay\":1440}' (returntx)\n```\nor\n```\nverus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":0}' (returntx)\n```\nThe first example will lock the ID until the block specified. If the block specified is in the past, the ID will not be locked.\nThe second example will set a 1440 block unlock delay, which will be needed to wait before spending funds controlled by the ID after unlocking the ID (about one day unlock time).\nThe third example will unlock an ID that has been locked with an unlock delay, and the unlock time will be set to the block height at which the ID was unlocked + the originally set unlock delay.",
