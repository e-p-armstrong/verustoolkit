    "What's the purpose of the testnet fork for the mainnet upgrade?",
    "There is no testnet fork for the mainnet upgrade. In fact, the text states that a testnet fork would not be relevant for the mainnet upgrade. Instead, accessing the v0.9.3 testnet requires resetting the local testnet by deleting the vrsctest and pbaas data folders.",
    "This update includes the first protocol release candidate for mainnet PBaaS, VerusID protocol upgrades, and Verus DeFi. In addition to some functional fixes and full web site support for mapped currencies and simple commands for mapping Verus currencies to any ERC20 currencies on Ethereum with provable, auditable 1:1 mapping and cross chain send/receive. In addition this new protocol upgrade changes some parameters of the Verus Proof of Power consensus algorithm, enabling smoother starts, restarts, and general operation of PBaaS chains, regardless of their native currency supply or emission schedule. As these consensus parameter changes would require either a testnet fork, which would not be relevant for the mainnet upgrade or a reset, accessing the v0.9.3 testnet requires that you reset your local testnet by deleting the vrsctest and pbaas data folders from the locations described below.As part of this release, we will be launching the new Ethereum bridge and enable full use of Ethereum mapped currencies on the Goerli Ethereum testnet (note that we were previously using Rinkeby). This makes it easy for any currency definition to become a fully decentralized, auditable stable coin, simply by mapping to DAI, USDT, USDC, or another stable coin on Ethereum. In addition, the new website for Metamask support and use from Ethereum now displays all mapped currency options, even those added when someone exports a currency definition to Ethereum, either as a mapped currency or for using any Verus or PBaaS currency as an ERC20.This release also resolves an issue with setting max preconversion amounts on currency launches and addresses a number of minor protocol issues found as a result of the active community testing support we are seeing on testnet.",
