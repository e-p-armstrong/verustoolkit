    "Is it possible to list all identities on the blockchain with the `listidentities` command?",
    "No, the `listidentities` command only lists the identities in your wallet, not all identities on the blockchain.",
    "Create your commitment with the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registernamecommitment Name youraddressorid referrerfriendlyname@\nThat will respond with something like:\n{\n \"txid\": \"377576f8ada1acc2aeb013ddf7a9ad86756cb990d4c5fc70b5a9a0fca43d727e\",\n \"namereservation\": {\n  \"name\": \"Name\",\n  \"salt\": \"7b981f0a1ff2593167ef078150d0116335a7f329f9403b0abaeca30a42d8876a\",\n  \"referral\": \"iSJLKp1hvn51Zg2Y6FBKjzLs9AAy7fomWN\",\n  \"parent\": \"\",\n  \"nameid\": \"iDXx9FPrAS5k2XCGss6FFmDQQMsts63uUg\"\n }\n}\n```\nYou then wait for the commitment to be mined into a block, then use the information returned above as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registeridentity '{\"txid\":\"377576f8ada1acc2aeb013ddf7a9ad86756cb990d4c5fc70b5a9a0fca43d727e\", \"namereservation\": {\n  \"name\": \"Name\", \"salt\": \"7b981f0a1ff2593167ef078150d0116335a7f329f9403b0abaeca30a42d8876a\", \"referral\":\"referrerfriendlyname@\"}, \"identity\":{\"name\":\"Name\", \"primaryaddresses\":[\"RKo5u8N1sStZu81fU8kaxhoDcFcJmNEwSp\"], \"minimumsignatures\":1, \"privateaddress\":\"zs14y0aa096em2as6n4fauyumqeywz45rfpze38c39fksgtjsac9vmms7fmstcylpaalm7rseu8838\"}}'\n```\nAs long as you have enough funds and you are registering a new identity on the blockchain, you will be able to use your new identity in place of an address as soon as the transaction created by the registration command is mined into the blockchain.\nYou may list the identities in your wallet with the command `listidentities`, and you may display specific identities with the command `getidentity`. If you have the authority, or use identities under your control as revocation or recovery authorities for other identities, you may also revoke and recovery identities as well.",
