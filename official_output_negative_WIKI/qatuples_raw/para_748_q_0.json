    "How do `*.veth@` IDs create 1:1 ERC20 mapped currencies on the Verus network?",
    "`*.veth@` IDs have the ability to create 1:1 ERC20 mapped currencies on Ethereum, not the Verus network. They, along with root `vrsctest` IDs, can be used to create these mapped currencies on the Ethereum blockchain.",
    "`*.veth@` IDs have the ability, along with root vrsctest IDs, to make 1:1 ERC20 mapped currencies on Ethereum. They can also be used to create Tokenized ID control tokens (see notes for v0.9.4-1), as all types of IDs can, but if they are used to do that, they will have used their currency creation ability for that rather than an ERC20 mapped currency.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. Drop by #pbaas-development to start building your vision on Verus and help prepare PBaaS for mainnet!### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):\nThe currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent\n`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration",
