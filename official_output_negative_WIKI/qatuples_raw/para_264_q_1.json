    "How can I use the `z_listunspent` command to list all spent shielded notes on the blockchain?",
    "The `z_listunspent` command does not list all spent shielded notes on the blockchain. Instead, it returns an array of unspent shielded notes with between `minconf` and `maxconf` (inclusive) confirmations. It can also be used to filter notes sent to specific addresses.",
