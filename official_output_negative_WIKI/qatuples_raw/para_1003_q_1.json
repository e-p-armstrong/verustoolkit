    "Can anyone mint new coins in a currency with `proofprotocol` set to 2?",
    "No, not anyone can mint new coins. Only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins when `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. This is a specific permission granted to the controller, not a general ability for anyone to mint new coins.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
