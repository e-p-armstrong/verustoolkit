    "Can I calculate the days to maturity by simply subtracting the current block height from the blockstomaturity?",
    "No, you can't calculate the days to maturity by simply subtracting the current block height from the blockstomaturity. The correct formula to use is blockstomaturity / 1440 = days to maturity (unlocking). This formula gives you the number of days until the immature block will mature.",
    "# Question: How do I know when an immature block will \"unlock\" (mature)?\n\n## Procedure:\n1. Get the values of the current block height (\"blocks\") and the \"blockstomaturity\" the distance to maturity of the transaction in question. (i.e. the number of blocks between current block height and where it unlocks. You can see the number is decreasing all the time, and if you add it to the current block height you'll see a constant.)\n2. Apply this formula: blockstomaturity / 1440 = days to maturity (unlocking)\n  e.g. 925558/1440=643 days\n\n(submitted by @J Oliver Westbrook, edited by @elvinsophus )",
