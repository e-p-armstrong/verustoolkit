    "What happens when you set the `proofprotocol` to 1 in a currency definition?",
    "The question is flawed because it doesn't specify what `proofprotocol` 1 would do. In the provided text, it's shown that setting `proofprotocol` to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID) allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. There is no information about what `proofprotocol` 1 would do.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n## Testnet Reset Instructions\n**Please delete the following directories before launching the testnet:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/VRSCTEST\n~/.verustest\n```",
