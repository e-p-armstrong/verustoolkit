    "How do I use the `getbalance` command to get the balance of a specific address in my wallet?",
    "The `getbalance` command actually returns the total amount in the wallet, not the balance of a specific address. To get the balance of a specific address, you should use the `getcurrencybalance` command instead. For example, to get the total amount received by address \"myaddress\", you can use `verus getcurrencybalance \"myaddress\"`.",
