    "The question assumes that mycoin can only be converted to with GOLD, but the text actually states that mycoin can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. To create mycoin, you would use a command like:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines a new token called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST.",
