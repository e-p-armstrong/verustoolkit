    "What happens to the 100 Verus cost of acquiring a Verus ID, does it go to a central authority?",
    "No, the 100 Verus cost of acquiring a Verus ID does not go to a central authority. Instead, the entire cost of an ID goes back into the network, either as referral fees or as mining and staking fees. No one besides people participating in the network as miners, stakers, or ID referrers take any proceeds from the cost of an identity.",
    "Verus IDs will cost Verus to acquire, 100 Verus per ID to be exact, which can be discounted to 80 Verus with referral of an existing Verus ID. The interesting twist is that all of the cost of an ID goes back into the network, either as referral fees, which are a way to get discounts or possibly even make money through referrals and built into the identity transactions themselves, or as mining and staking fees. No one besides people participating in the network as miners, stakers, or ID referrers take any proceeds from the cost of an identity. If you refer someone new and they purchase an ID with your ID as a referral, they will receive a 20% discount on the ID. In addition:1. You will receive 20 Verus directly\n2. The person who referred you, if there is one, will receive 20 Verus\n3. The person who referred person b, if there is one, will receive 20 Verus, and\n3. The miner or staker will receive the remainder of the discounted 80 Verus costAs you might expect from looking at the fact that anywhere from 20 to 100 Verus goes to miners and stakers of Verus for each new identity once identities hit mainnet, some Verus blocks may have VERY high rewards for some time. The best thing about that is that regardless of how much the Verus blockchain rewards miners over and above the pre-determined coinbase reward, it will be as a result of the **on-chain economy**, paid for by people buying identities with **no inflation** of the money supply\\! If you or your friends missed the early days of the Verus launch, **you don't want to miss this** new opportunity to be mining, staking or referring now **Verus IDs are activated on the mainnet\\!**.## VerusPay#### Blockchain-integrated payment gateway for accepting Verus Coin (VRSC) in a WooCommerce ecommerce store",
