    "How does the new CHIPS test chain on testnet support 1-minute block times?",
    "The new CHIPS test chain on testnet actually supports 10-second block times, not 1-minute block times. This was made possible by CHIPS developer @Biz, who modified and tested the Verus PoP algorithm to support this faster block time. In the future, the block time and PoW averaging window for any PBaaS chain's PoP consensus will be configurable between 10 seconds and 2 minutes.",
    "This release also includes a new capability for testnet, which was pioneered by CHIPS developer @Biz, who worked to modify and test the Verus PoP algorithm to support 10 second block times, which the CHIPS chain uses to enable its game application focus. These new parameters will enable the CHIPS blockchain to move to being an interoperable, merge mineable PBaaS chain with a 10 second blocktime when PBaaS goes live on mainnet. To learn how to test the new CHIPS test chain on testnet, visit the #pbaas-development channel, as the support in v0.9.4-5 is not as complete as it will be in the next and hopefully final testnet reset. In that next version, blocktime and the pow averaging window for any PBaaS chain\u2019s PoP consensus will be able to be configured between 10 seconds and 2 minutes in addition to its notarization frequency as part of the chain definition, enabling a greater variety of PBaaS use cases, transaction throughput, and application capabilities.As a reminder, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services , using your metamask, converting or sending cross chain through the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the #pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for mainnet and start building your vision today!",
