    "What is the default liquidity threshold for the `getcurrencyconverters` API?",
    "The text does not mention a specific default liquidity threshold for the `getcurrencyconverters` API. However, it does mention that the API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves, which suggests that these conditions are the threshold for the API.",
