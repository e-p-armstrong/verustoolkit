    "What does it mean if the result of the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command is `false`?",
    "The question is based on a flawed premise. According to the text, the result will be `true` if the signature is valid, but it does not mention what it means if the result is `false`. However, it's reasonable to assume that if the result is not `true`, then the signature is not valid, and the download may be tampered with or corrupted.",
