    "Why is it recommended to use the Verus wallet for solo-mining setups?",
    "Actually, it is not recommended to use the Verus wallet (GUI and CLI) for solo-mining setups. This is because the Verus wallet does a lot more than mining, and it's better suited for pool-mining.",
    "# Windows pool-mining on low priority.## Links to VRSC miners:[Miners download page](https://verus.io/getVRSC.html)## Procedure:In order to let your mining not interfere with other processes running on your PC, we'll need to deprioritize\nthe mining process. This will result in your miner throttling down whenever your PC needs processing power.\nPeople have reported to be able to use CPU-heavy applications, like games, without the miner interfering, with\nthis method.Because the Verus wallet (GUI and CLI) does a lot more than mining, it is not recommended to use this for a\nsolo-mining setup. This is tested on Verus NHEQminer and Verus CCMiner on Windows 10.First thing you will need is pool-mining software. The link is supplied above this procedure. Download your\npreferred miner, extract it to your prefered location and configure the batchfile with the pool of your choice\nand your own mining address.Now we'll need to adjust the batchfile to run on low priority:##### NHEQMINER:- change to the folder you extracted the download\n - edit the `start.bat`\n - Scroll down to the line, that needs to be adjusted:\n   `nheqminer.exe -v -l %PoolHost%:%Port% -u %PublicVerusCoinAddress%.%WorkerName% -t %Threads% %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9`\n - adjust the line so it looks like this:\n   `%windir%\\system32\\cmd.exe /c start \"NHEQminer VRSC\" /Low \"%THIS_DIR%\\nheqminer.exe\" -v -l %PoolHost%:%Port% -u %PublicVerusCoinAddress%.%WorkerName% -t %Threads% %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9`\n - save and exit the file\n - run `start.bat` to start mining##### CCMINER:",
