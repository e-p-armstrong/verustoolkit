    "Does the auto-arbitrage feature in v0.9.6 release benefit only miners and stakers?",
    "No, the auto-arbitrage feature is designed to benefit not just miners and stakers, but also blockchain users and liquidity providers (LPs). Miners and stakers can capture guaranteed arbitrage opportunities, blockchain users can set limit orders and have them filled at market prices, and LPs and users of liquidity baskets can get close to market prices on their conversions. The feature is designed to create a win-win situation for all participants.",
    "v0.9.6 also includes support for new parameters `-arbitragecurrencies=[\u201cVRSCTEST\u201d,\u201dvETH\u201d]` and `-arbitrageaddress=valid R-address, pubkey, or ID`. They\u2019re exciting, but don\u2019t try to use them just yet. They are for testing right now, and are preparing for an \u201cauto-arbitrage\u201d feature already supported in the protocol, but which we hope to have in the daemon before mainnet PBaaS activation that combines decentralized on-chain marketplace offers for currency with liquidity basket import processing to provide miners and stakers the opportunity to commit some amount of funds from their node wallet in common currencies to spot and leverage guaranteed arbitrage opportunities when making a block. These opportunities arise between orders on chain and liquidity basket pricing that if leveraged to earn, actually result in P2P crowdsourcing of liquidity for all baskets across the network, both from the blockchain itself as well as miners and stakers, while benefiting all participants in the following ways:\n- Miners and stakers can capture guaranteed arbitrage opportunities and arbitrage with any currency that they choose from their wallets.\n- Blockchain users can set limit orders and have them filled if they are near the market price for a currency, or if the market moves in their direction.\n- LPs and users of liquidity baskets for conversion get as close to market prices as possible on their conversions, never releasing funds from a basket before an on-chain, MEV-resistant auction takes place for the pricing of those assets.Although this release is likely to be robust enough for a mainnet, we have come this far with quality and will not rush for a few days earlier upgrade. We still plan to review and complete a small number of hardening items before PBaaS 1.0 is ready for its mainnet release.",
