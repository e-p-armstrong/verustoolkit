    "# Compile Monkins Verus enhanced CCMiner for various hardware\n\nRead it completely before using.\n\n## Important General Information\n\nThis guide is aimed towards Debian based Linux distributions. If you are using a different kind of distribution\n(eg RPM-based, like CentOS) you will need to install the dependancies using a procedure that fits your\nspecific distribution.\n\nThere are 3 active branches in ccminer github repo:\n `ARM`       (for 64bit ARM chips with AES intrinsic)\n `Verus2.2`    (standard x86-64 pc's)\n `Verus2.2gpu`   (GPUs)\n\nNote: Replace `ARM` in the `git clone` line below with the branchname above you want to use.\n\n## Procedure:\n\nInstall dependencies (specific for Debian-based distributions):\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libjansson-dev automake autotools-dev build-essential git\n```\nFor GPU-miner compilation additional sources are required (Not needed for CPU or ARM):\n```bash\nwget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.2/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.2.89_440.33.01_linux.run\nsudo sh cuda_10.2.89_440.33.01_linux.run\n```\nDownload the source and compile:\n```bash\ngit clone --single-branch -b ARM https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer.git\ncd ccminer\nchmod +x build.sh\nchmod +x configure.sh\nchmod +x autogen.sh\n./build.sh\n```\nAnd finally starting the miner (Change pool, address & workername to your own liking):\n```bash\n./ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.donator -p x\n```\n\nInfo from @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining.\n\nNote: last revision date 2021-04-20.",
