            "How do I use Verus Vault to instantly access my locked VerusID and spend my funds without any delay?",
            "You can't. With Verus Vault, a locked VerusID requires an unlock delay, which is a predetermined time period that must pass before the ID can be unlocked and funds can be accessed or spent. This delay is a security feature that prevents unauthorized access to your funds and allows for decentralized recovery of your assets in case of a security breach.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",

            "Is it true that Verus Vault is a centralized solution that relies on a single entity to protect and recover my funds?",
            "No, that's not correct. Verus Vault is a decentralized solution that allows you to protect and recover your funds without relying on a central authority or bank. The revocation and recovery authorities can be assigned to trusted identities, which can be separate from the primary keys, providing an additional layer of security and decentralization.",
