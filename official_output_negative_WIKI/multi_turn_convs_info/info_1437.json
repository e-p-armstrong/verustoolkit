            "Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky detect Verus software as a virus?",
            "Antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky do not detect Verus software as a virus. Instead, they may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is mining software that could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and the software is safe to use.",
