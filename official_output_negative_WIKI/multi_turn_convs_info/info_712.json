            "No, it is not possible to reduce the timelock period on a Verus Vault locked ID in version v0.7.4. In fact, this release fixes the issue that allowed the timelock period to be reduced, ensuring that the timelock period remains fixed and secure.",
            "**The result will be true if the signature is valid.**\n```\ntrue\n```\n# ANNOUNCING HIGHLY RECOMMENDED NON-MANDATORY, CRITICAL FOR NOTARIES AND POOLS UPDATE, v0.7.4.Version v0.7.4 can improve a node\u2019s synchronization and this version also upgrades and resets the Verus testnet, preparing it for the testnet launch of the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge and bringing Verus PBaaS multi-chain, multi-currency, Verus Vault ID timelocking, Verus MEV-resistant DeFi, and the Ethereum bridge much closer to a mainnet ready state.This release fixes all known functionality issues reported from the previous testnet including some related to currency and blockchain launches, as well as being incorrectly able to reduce the timelock period on a Verus Vault locked ID. It also includes the ability to export an ID from one chain to another, using the \u201cexportid\u201d:true parameter in sendcurrency, enabling cross-chain use of VerusIDs. With this release, we will be resetting the Verus testnet. To use the new testnet, you must make sure to delete the vrsctest and .verustest/pbaas or VerusTest\\pbaas folders beforehand.In addition to being prepared for the Ethereum bridge launch, this release adds some new testnet capabilities, including the ability to send to IDs cross chain and export IDs from chain to chain using the `\u201cexportid\u201d:true` parameter with `sendcurrency`. IDs only need to be exported once and can then be used and managed directly as a forked ID on the destination chain.## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n  ```",
