            "Why do Verus downloads come with a warning that they might be viruses?",
            "Verus downloads do not come with a warning that they might be viruses. The warnings you might see from antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky are false positives, indicating that the software is a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which means they detect mining software that could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. These warnings are not because Verus downloads are viruses, but rather because they include mining software.",
