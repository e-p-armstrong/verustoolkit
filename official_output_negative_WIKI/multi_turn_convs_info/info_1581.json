            "Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky never flag the Verus software as a potential threat?",
            "Actually, Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which are warnings that the software is mining software that could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a common false positive, and there are resources available to clarify this.",

            "How do I verify the download of Verus CLI without using the provided text file or signature?",
            "You can't. The recommended method is to verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. This ensures the authenticity and integrity of the download. There are CLI examples provided to help with this process, such as `verifyfile` and `verifyhash`.",
