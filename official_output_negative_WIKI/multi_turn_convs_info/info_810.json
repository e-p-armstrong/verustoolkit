            "If you don't update to v0.9.5 or later by block 2291830 (approximately 11:00 PM UTC, Saturday, November 19th, 2022), you will NOT be able to reliably stay synchronized to the Verus mainnet.",
            "**The result will be true if the signature is valid.**\n```\ntrue\n```\n Announcing v0.9.5-2, RECOMMENDED UPDATE FOR MAINNET - CRITICAL FOR CONTINUED TESTNET USEYOU MUST BE UPDATED TO v0.9.5 OR LATER BY BLOCK 2291830, AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 PM UTC, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 19th, 2022 TO RELIABLY STAY SYNCHRONIZED TO THE VERUS MAINNET. WHILE THERE MAY BE A MAINNET PBAAS UPGRADE BEFORE THAT DATE, WE RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT UPGRADED YET, THAT YOU DO SO NOW.As with all v0.9.5-* releases, this release updates the Komodo notaries to season 6, with an activation height of 2291830, at approximately 11:00 PM UTC, Saturday, November 19th, 2022.## What\u2019s New\nFor mainnet, this release labels spendable transactions for the getaddressutxos RPC API, which is used by Verus Mobile. This update is critical for users that have not upgraded to v0.9.5+ before block 2291830.For testnet, v0.9.5-2 introduces minor notarization fixes that will be important for those intending to launch and witness PBaaS chains.## Ethereum Bridge\nAlthough its deployment has been delayed, there are no technical blockers, and we still expect the Ethereum bridge to be brought back up on the new Verus testnet within the next day or two. When it is up, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services/, and use your metamask to convert or send cross-chain to the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.",
