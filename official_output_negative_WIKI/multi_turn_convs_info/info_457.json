            "How does the Verus protocol charge a 1% protocol fee for conversions between currencies?",
            "The Verus protocol actually charges a standard protocol fee of 0.01% for conversions between currencies, not 1%. This fee goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network.",
            "Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. Sending currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies is as easy as sending a cryptocurrency in less advanced systems today, except that the new Verus protocol enables you to include another blockchain as part of your destination and convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price along the way. All conversions are fully decentralized, require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network, and calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization of any size to make a currency with its own blockchain, support it in world class wallets, develop its own applications, and use it for payments worldwide that can be converted to the reserve currency without ever having to leave the blockchain network. Each blockchain is independent and connected through the Verus Reserve protocol.",
