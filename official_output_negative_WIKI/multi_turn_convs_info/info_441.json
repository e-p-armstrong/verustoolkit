            "Is it possible to create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name?",
            "No, it is not recommended to create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. In fact, it is explicitly advised against doing so. This is because using an i-address as a currency name can cause problems and confusion, especially when trying to refer to the currency or identity. The protocol does not prevent creating such an ID, but it will not be supported for creating currencies.",
            "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies.
