            "You can't get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for all blocks in the blockchain using the `getcurrencystate` command. The command only allows you to get the currency state for the most recent block, a specific block, or a range of blocks with a specific period between them. For example, you can use `./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate` to get the currency state for the most recent block, or `./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep` to get the currency state for a range of blocks.",
