            "Can I use the `sendreserve` command to send VRSCTEST directly to a wallet on another chain without converting it to the native currency of that chain?",
            "No, you cannot use the `sendreserve` command to send VRSCTEST directly to a wallet on another chain without converting it to the native currency of that chain. The `sendreserve` command is used to send reserve currency to an address on another chain, and it will arrive as reserve currency. If you want to send VRSCTEST to an address on another chain and convert it to the native currency of that chain, you need to use the `tonative` option, like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```\nThis will send the VRSCTEST and convert it to the native currency of the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain at the current market price.",
            "**Sending unconverted VRSCTEST to an address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain for later conversion to/from the native coin.**\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000}'\n```**Sending reserve to another chain and converting a coin from reserve to that chain's native currency at the current market price.**\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```**Sending reserve currency to an address on the current PBaaS reserve chain with no cross-chain operation, Reserve currency on a PBaaS chain is equivalent to and convertible between the native VRSCTEST currency, but may also be sent to and used on PBaaS reserve chains.
