            "Why do I need to pay attention to the \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" warnings from Avast and Kaspersky when installing Verus?",
            "The \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" warnings from Avast and Kaspersky are not necessarily a problem. These warnings are triggered because Verus is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, in this case, you are intentionally installing Verus, so these warnings are false positives. You can review the resources provided to learn more about these false positives.",
