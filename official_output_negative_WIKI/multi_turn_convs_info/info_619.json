            "How does the cross-chain bridging technology in v0.9.9 rely solely on notary witnesses for transaction validation?",
            "The cross-chain bridging technology in v0.9.9 does not rely solely on notary witnesses for transaction validation. Instead, it enables cryptographically provable, cross-chain bridging across Verus and all PBaaS and other connected blockchains in the network, either combined with or independent of the need for notary witnesses. This means that while notary witnesses can be used to speed up cross-chain transactions, the technology also provides a security fallback against misbehaving notary witnesses, making it possible to operate without them if needed.",
            "4. **Bridging Blockchain Networks Without Witnesses**: v0.9.9 is the first release of any blockchain protocol anywhere that we know of which enables cryptographically provable, cross-chain bridging across Verus and all PBaaS and other connected blockchains in the network, either combined with or independent of the need for notary witnesses. With notary witnesses, cross-chain transactions complete faster, but they are also checked against cryptographic evidence, making it difficult to impossible for anyone, including notary witnesses to take any action, even colluding with validators that would go against the wishes of the most chain power. We have been referring to this new cross-chain consensus technology as \u201cauto-notarization\u201d, as that is what it actually is, but it would also be accurate to call it Proof of Proof of Power, as that is how it works. For purposes of ensuring everyone understands the state of the technology, it is fully functional and we have taken great care to ensure it is sufficiently secure, but we have not yet had the protocol proven to an academic standard. Because of that, while it provides a security fall-back against misbehaving notary witnesses and will be fully functional and we believe sufficiently secure without notary witnesses on release, we currently recommend toconsider the protocol unproven at this time and that any serious PBaaS chains be launched with operational notary witnesses until further notice.",
