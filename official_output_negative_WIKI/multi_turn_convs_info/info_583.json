            "You don't need to start the Verus daemon before stopping it to update to a new version. In fact, the instructions explicitly state to stop the Verus daemon (`./verus stop`) before renaming the old binaries, unpacking the new ones, and starting the daemon again with the new version.",

            "No, you should not skip step 12. After updating the Verus daemon, it's possible that the `VRSC.conf` file may have been overridden, which means the daemon might not know where to find your blockchain data.
