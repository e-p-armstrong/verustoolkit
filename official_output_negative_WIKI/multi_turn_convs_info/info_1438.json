            "Can I use a currency like BTC or ETH as a PBaaS chain in the Verus Desktop?",
            "No, you cannot use a currency like BTC or ETH as a PBaaS chain in the Verus Desktop if it is already supported in the Verus Desktop. This is a limitation of the current testnet release, but it will not be a limitation when the mainnet is available.",

This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.### DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
