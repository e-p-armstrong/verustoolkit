            "How does the \"burn\" parameter in the \"sendcurrency\" API increase the on-chain price for all holders of a currency?",
            "The \"burn\" parameter in the \"sendcurrency\" API actually decreases the supply of a currency, not increases the on-chain price for all holders. When \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent (which must be a token or fractional currency) is officially removed from that currency's supply. This can lead to an increase in the on-chain price for all holders of a fractional currency, but that is an indirect effect, not a direct result of the \"burn\" parameter.",
            "# Enhancements to TestNet Protocols for Increased Scale, Currency Burn Functions, and Centralized Fractional Currencies\nVersion v0.7.1-3 is not yet considered hardened for mainnet, but has increased scale over previous versions in addition to the ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency. This allows price neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. This version also enables a new parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API called \"burn\". If \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent, which must be a token or fractional currency is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.# An end to front running\nConversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.",

            "No, that's not correct. In fact, the conversion rate between currencies is always the same for all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is no spread between the conversion to and from a currency, and all transactions in an aggregation of import blocks are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions, with all converters getting the same price in each direction.",

            "The currency controller doesn't profit from the automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. The automatic reductions enable price-neutral minting by the currency controller, which means that the controller can mint new currency without affecting the price.
