            "Can you explain how Verus PBaaS Reserve technology allows organizations to create their own blockchain without any requirements for notarizations or a minimum amount of VRSCTEST?",
            "Actually, Verus PBaaS Reserve technology does require a minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations and a minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization to create a chain. Additionally, VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet to make a chain. This is a necessary part of the process to ensure the integrity and security of the blockchain network.",
