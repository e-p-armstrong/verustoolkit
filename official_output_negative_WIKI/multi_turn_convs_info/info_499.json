            "How can I verify downloads without using the provided txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature?",
            "You can't. The txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is necessary for verifying downloads. The verification process involves extracting the downloaded archive, verifying the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extracting the archive to the desired directory.",
