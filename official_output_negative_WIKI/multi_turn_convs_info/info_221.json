            "The Verus API doesn't retrieve currencies based on an exact amount of VRSC in reserve. Instead, it retrieves currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. The correct command to retrieve currencies with BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold is:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```",

The API only retrieves currencies that are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, along with other conditions.
