            "Actually, creating a new token requires preconversion of VRSCTEST to GOLD. Specifically, 1000 VRSCTEST must be preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch the token. So, it's not possible to create a new token without preconversion of VRSCTEST to GOLD.",

You can park your conversion until the token launches by sending a `sendcurrency` command with the `preconvert` option set to 1.
