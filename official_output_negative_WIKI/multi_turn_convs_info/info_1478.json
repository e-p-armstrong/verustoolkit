            "You don't. Verus ID and NFT Marketplace are designed to execute transactions in a completely decentralized way, without any intermediary necessary. You can buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed directly, peer-to-peer, without the need for a centralized authority.",
