            "How can journalists use Verus ID signatures to make deep-fakes more convincing?",
            "That's not correct. Verus ID signatures can actually be used by journalists to counter the potential for deep-fakes to make the truth harder to find. By signing photos, videos, and content with Verus ID signatures, journalists can establish a reputation for authenticity and ensure that their work is verified as genuine.",
            "For example, using Verus ID signatures, it\u2019s possible for any journalist anywhere to sign photos, videos, and content, establish a reputation for authenticity, and counter the potential for deep-fakes to make the truth harder to find. Open source projects can now create their own identities and digitally sign their binary releases, ensuring that not only can a file be verified by hash as the one downloaded from a particular server, but by signature as the actual file initially signed by the developer or release engineer. Signatures also form the basis for any attestation of one party to the validity of another. In fact, there are so many applications for digital signatures, from things listed already, to physical entry systems, to workflow applications, to new earning opportunities that a full discussion of use cases would overwhelm these release notes.In any case, we are happy to release digital signatures for all, and we hope you enjoy using this new, simple capability, maybe even think of a new use case you\u2019d like to pursue yourself as a business opportunity on the Verus Network!# Verus ID\nVerus IDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system.
