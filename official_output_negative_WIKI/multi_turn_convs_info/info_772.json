            "What's the expected timeline for fixing the remaining issues in the PBaaS protocol before its mainnet release?",
            "Actually, there are no known changes required, and all functions should work as intended. The release is expected to be the final PBaaS protocol that will be released on mainnet, with no anticipated changes before mainnet release.",
            "That said, this release fixes all reported issues in all community testing. Community developers, including myself are grateful for all of the testing many have contributed to to date. It has made it possible to get incredible test coverage across all network capabilities, and we appreciate all of your participation and pushing of boundaries. This release is expected to be the final PBaaS protocol that will be released on mainnet. There are no known changes required, and all functions should work as intended.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the #pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for mainnet release in the next couple weeks and start building your vision today!## Verus PBaaS and DeFi RC6 - BUG BOUNTIES\nAt this time, we are not aware of any bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross chain protocols on this version of testnet. We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release. While we don\u2019t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people (7 still unclaimed) who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended. If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.",
