            "Can I sell a VerusID or NFT on the Verus marketplace without any transparency, so that the buyer doesn't know who I am?",
            "Actually, the Verus ID and NFT marketplace allows for transactions to be executed in a completely decentralized way, with the option to pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address. This means that you can choose to maintain your privacy while still conducting a secure and auditable transaction.",
            "### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.",

            "Is it true that I can't stake my funds on the Verus network if I lock my VerusID with Verus Vault?",
            "No, that's not correct. According to the Verus Vault feature, even if you lock your VerusID with Vault, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn rewards by doing so. Additionally, you can still receive funds while your VerusID is locked.",
