            "What's the deal with the Verus Mainnet Protocol upgrade? I heard it's happening on July 1st.",
            "Actually, the Verus Mainnet Protocol upgrade is happening at block 1053660, which is expected to occur on June 14th, not July 1st. It's crucial to upgrade by then, or you may need to resynchronize the blockchain if you're running in native mode.",
            "**MAKE SURE TO UPGRADE BY June 14TH, OR YOU MAY NEED TO RESYNCHRONIZE THE BLOCKCHAIN IF YOU ARE RUNNING IN NATIVE MODE.**At block 1053660, the Verus Mainnet Protocol will upgrade to the new Komodo Notary Nodes for Komodo dPoW notarization, season 4, and a number of new capabilities, as well as a change to the Verus Proof of Power staking and mining hash will go live on the Verus mainnet as well.## The network upgrade will activate the following features:\n- Added support for season 4 Komodo notary node operators- Coinbase shielding will no longer be required on any coinbases from the past that have not yet been shielded.- Staking will now work on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds.- A new `sendcurrency` API for the command line provides more control when sending from and to multiple addresses or identities.- `updateidentity` will now be able to change the case of characters in the name of a VerusID in the global locale.- Revocation identity will now lose all control over an ID after revocation, including the ability to still change the revocation identity itself, which it used to retain. After revocation now, the recovery identity will have full control over the revoked ID.- Staking and hashing consensus protocol updates with VerusHash 2.2## Notable Changes:\n- Fix Komodo S4 notary count\n- `sendcurrency` does not require coinbase funds to be shielded.# Disclaimer",

            "No, that's not true. With the upcoming upgrade, staking will now work on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds. This is actually a new feature being added with the upgrade.",
