            "No, Verus blockchain launches don't require a centralized authority to manage the liquidity pool. In fact, the liquidity pool can be either fully decentralized or centralized, giving flexibility in the launch setup. The bridge converter currencies are bound to the launch of the new blockchain and run on it, with all fees earned on the new blockchain, ensuring seamless connectivity.",
