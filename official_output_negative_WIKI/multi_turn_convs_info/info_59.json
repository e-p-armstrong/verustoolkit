            "How do decentralized currencies issue IDs without any payment or fees?",
            "Decentralized currencies do not issue IDs without any payment or fees. In fact, for fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, which reduces the supply and raises the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves. This means that there is a cost associated with ID registration, which is paid in the form of the fractional currency.",
            "All fractional and centralized {\u201cproofprotocol\u201d:2} currencies can now issue as a decentralized operation, or with centralized currencies, sell, IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, permission from the currency identity required, which means the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity, or even referrals required, which means that an identity registration must have a referral and co-signature of a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.\nFor fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone.\nThe minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself, or in one of its reserves, for example USDC or DAI.\nMore than the minimum price can be paid for ID registration, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.\nEach currency, either centralized and/or fractional, can have multiple levels of referral support (limit of 5 levels), meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies, or be sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.",
