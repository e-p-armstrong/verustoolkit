            "Why do the antivirus software Avast and Kaspersky correctly identify the Verus software as malware?",
            "Avast and Kaspersky do not correctly identify the Verus software as malware. They may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which are warnings that the software is mining software that could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, this is a false positive, as the Verus software is legitimate and not malicious.",
