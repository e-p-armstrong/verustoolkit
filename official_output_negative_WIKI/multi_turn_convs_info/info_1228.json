            "How can I create a new token without converting any VRSCTEST to the new token?",
            "Unfortunately, that's not possible. To create a new token, you need to have a certain amount of VRSCTEST preconverted to the new token. For example, to launch GOLD, you need 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD. This is part of the mining process, where mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new token.",

I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option.
