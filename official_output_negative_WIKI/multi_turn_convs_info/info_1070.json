            "You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. In fact, it's generally advised not to do so, as it can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used. The protocol doesn't prevent making an ID with an i-address as its name, but it's not supported for creating currencies.",

Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies.
