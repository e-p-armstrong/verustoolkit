            "You can't make a new identity in Verus without paying fees. To register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity, in which case the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money is automatically spent along with your registration.",
            "## Making a new identity\nArguably, the hardest part of the new Verus identity technology is just making your first identity, especially without a GUI. Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ \u2018[{\u201caddress\u201d:\u201dalice@\u201d, \u201camount\u201d:100}]\u2019\n```\nor\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100\n```\nMaking a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. To prevent this name \u201cfront running\u201d, you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration.

            "Can anyone replace your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead?",
            "No, the Verus ID system is designed to prevent \"name front running\" by requiring a two-step process to create an ID. First, you must commit to a name, which registers your commitment but keeps the name secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. This prevents someone else from replacing your purchase of an ID with their own purchase of the same name.",
