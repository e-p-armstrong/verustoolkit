            "Can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies, regardless of their reserve amounts or ratios?",
            "No, you cannot. The `getcurrencyconverters` API has specific filters in place to only return currencies that meet certain criteria, such as having at least 1000 VRSC in reserve and a reserve ratio greater than 10%. It does not return all currencies, unlike what you assumed.",

BTC ETH:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n  ```\n  Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
