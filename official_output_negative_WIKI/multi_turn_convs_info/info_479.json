            "Can you explain why it's perfectly fine to use an i-address as the actual name of an ID when creating a new currency?",
            "Actually, it's not recommended to use an i-address as the actual name of an ID when creating a new currency. This is because using an i-address as the name of an ID can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used, and will not be supported for creating currencies. The naming system will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations to reduce user confusion.",
            "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies.

            "No, that's not possible in the current testnet release. If a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, you won't be able to use the same name for a PBaaS chain.
