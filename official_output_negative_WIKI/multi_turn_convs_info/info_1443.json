            "Can IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies launch their own currencies on the Verus blockchain?",
            "No, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch their own currencies on the Verus blockchain. Only Native IDs, registered directly from a blockchain, can launch currencies. IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies can still be valuable for other purposes, such as revocation and recovery IDs, personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses, and more.",
            "While Native IDs, those registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, will be able to launch currencies on that blockchain, and if on Verus, actual independent blockchains, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, but will still be valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features, for proofs, for brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login, and will have the ability to cross-prove common ownership with other IDs as well.The exception to non-native IDs creating currencies, is that *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter and will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. Registration of .veth IDs will be priced at a level to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.All of these features are currently enabled on the v0.9.2 new testnet.
