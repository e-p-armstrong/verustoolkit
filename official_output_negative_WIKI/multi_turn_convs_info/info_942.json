            "Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which are warnings that you are installing mining software that may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. These false positives can be reviewed in the resources provided.",
