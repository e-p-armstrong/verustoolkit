            "Why do Avast and Kaspersky consider Verus mining software to be a virus?",
            "Avast and Kaspersky do not consider Verus mining software to be a virus. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is mining software and may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is not an indication that the software is malicious, but rather a cautionary measure to inform users of the software's purpose.",
