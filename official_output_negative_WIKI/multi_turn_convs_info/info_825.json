            "What is the purpose of the `checkifverusdisrunning.sh` script, and how does it work?",
            "The `checkifverusdisrunning.sh` script checks if the `verusd` daemon is running, and if it has stopped, it emails the user. It doesn't actually start the daemon if it's not running, as you might think. It only sends an email if the daemon has stopped.",
            "# Linux Bash Scripts To Make Mining Life Easier.\nFollowing are some bash scriptse to help make managing your Linux-based CLI miner a bit easier. Prereq is to install mailutils (postfix) and configure with your server's FQDN and set inet_interfaces=localhost in the postfix/main.cf file.### Important General Information\n`VRSC Wallet & data location` on Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC`\nfor wallet version prior to 0.5.7, replace verusd with komodod.## Scripts:#### MINER SRVC MONITOR & ALERT IF DOWNChecks for the verusd daemon and if it has stopped emails you.##### checkifverusdisrunning.sh```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nif pgrep -x \"verusd\" > /dev/null\nthen\n  TRUE=\"1\"\nelse\n  echo \"Merry Miner Has Stopped Mining!!! HELP!!\" | mail -s \"OUTAGE: Merry\" -a \"From: user@yourqualifieddomain.tld\" you@youremail.tld\nfi\n```#### ALERT ON NEW BLOCKS MINEDPrereq: Create a file called txHistory.txt and put 0 in it, saved to your home folder.\nThe script then compares the current wallet TX count and compares to the txHistory file...\nso first run it will enter the right number in that file overwriting your 0.\nOnly emails you if the number changes.##### checkfornewblocks.sh```bash\n#!/bin/bashhistoricalcount=$(cat /home/user/txHistory.txt)\nlivecount=$(/home/user/verus-cli/verus getwalletinfo | grep txcount | sed 's/[^0-9]*//g')if (($livecount > $historicalcount))\nthen\n  echo $livecount > /home/user/txHistory.txt\n  echo \"Merry Miner Has Mined a Total of $livecount Blocks! Woot!\" | mail -s \"Merry's Blocks: $livecount\" -a \"From: user@yourqualifieddomain.tld\" you@youremail.tld\nelse\n NOCHANGE=\"1\"\nfi\n```#### WALLET BACKUP TO SECURED EMAIL (PROTONMAIL SUGGESTED)For this script I recommend setting up a new Protonmail account with no association to any other service or your name, 2FA secure it.#### Schedule script in CRONTAB",
