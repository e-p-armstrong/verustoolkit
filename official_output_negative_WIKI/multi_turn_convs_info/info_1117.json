            "How does Verus's mining and staking fee model create a risk of weakening blockchain security?",
            "Actually, Verus's Fee Pooling technology is designed to strengthen blockchain security, not weaken it. It does this by preserving the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, thus addressing concerns about blockchain security.",
            "- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",

            "What is the main purpose of Verus Vault, and how does it work?",
            "Verus Vault is not just for theft-resistant workflow of identity management, as you might think. It's a more comprehensive solution that enables various use cases such as trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, estate planning, and more. Verus Vault works by providing advanced time-locking capabilities for identities, which can be combined with the revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID to create a robust and secure identity management system.",
