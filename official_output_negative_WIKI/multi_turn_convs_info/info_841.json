            "How do locked VerusIDs prevent against the 5 dollar wrench attack, since the revocation and recovery authorities can just circumvent the lock?",
            "Actually, the lock on a VerusID is designed to work in conjunction with the revocation and recovery authorities. The lock requires a predetermined unlock time to pass before the funds can be accessed, giving the revocation and recovery authorities time to detect and respond to any unauthorized unlocks. This means that even if someone tries to unlock the ID using the primary keys, they will still have to wait for the unlock time to pass, during which time the revocation and recovery authorities can intervene and prevent the unauthorized access.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet\nWith an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite.

            "Can you only create new identities, currencies, and blockchains on the Verus testnet using programming?",
            "No, you don't need to know how to program to create new identities, currencies, and blockchains on the Verus testnet. The testnet provides an easy-to-use GUI for basic operations, and a command-line interface for more advanced functions, allowing you to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without needing to write any code.",
