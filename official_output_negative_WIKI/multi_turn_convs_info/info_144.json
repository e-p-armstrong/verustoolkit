            "Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky consider Verus software to be malicious?",
            "Antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky do not consider Verus software to be malicious. They may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software includes mining capabilities that could be used to exploit your PC if installed by a third party without your knowledge or consent.",

            "No, you cannot continue to use the old version of Verus after block 800200. The Verus mainnet protocol will hardfork at block 800200, and this update is mandatory to remain on the Verus mainnet. If you don't upgrade by December 15th, you may need to resynchronize the blockchain if you are running in native mode.",
