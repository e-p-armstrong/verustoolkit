            "Can you explain why all decentralized currencies with a `proofprotocol` of 2 require a central authority to issue IDs?",
            "Actually, the opposite is true. All fractional and centralized currencies with a `proofprotocol` of 2 can now issue IDs as a decentralized operation. This means that no central authority is required to issue IDs. Instead, the currency identity itself can create and co-sign the transaction, or referrals can be required, which would necessitate a referral and co-signature from a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.",
            "All fractional and centralized {\u201cproofprotocol\u201d:2} currencies can now issue as a decentralized operation, or with centralized currencies, sell, IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, permission from the currency identity required, which means the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity, or even referrals required, which means that an identity registration must have a referral and co-signature of a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.\nFor fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone.\nThe minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself, or in one of its reserves, for example USDC or DAI.\nMore than the minimum price can be paid for ID registration, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.\nEach currency, either centralized and/or fractional, can have multiple levels of referral support (limit of 5 levels), meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies, or be sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.",

            "How do fully decentralized fractional currencies handle ID registration fees?",
            "Fully decentralized fractional currencies handle ID registration fees by burning the specific fractional currency, which reduces the supply and raises the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves. This means that the ID registration fee is not sent to a central authority or entity, but rather is used to reduce the supply of the fractional currency and increase its value.",

            "No, it is not possible to set a maximum price for ID registration for fractional currencies. Instead, the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves (e.g. USDC or DAI).
