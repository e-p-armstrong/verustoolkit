            "Why do I need to use the Veruscoin foundation's address when configuring the miner to connect to a mining pool?",
            "You don't need to use the Veruscoin foundation's address when configuring the miner to connect to a mining pool. In fact, the instructions explicitly state to \"make sure to use your own address!!!!\" when editing the `PublicVerusCoinAddress` line in the `start.sh` file. This is so that the mining rewards are sent to your own VerusCoin address, not someone else's.",
            "Now we need to configure things so the miner connects to a mining pool (listed on the download page, below the miner download) and mines to your address. In the instructions below I will use the VerusCoin community pool and the address for the Veruscoin foundation. make sure to use your own address and if desired the details of a different pool:\n 5. click `start.sh` and open with `TextEdit.app`\n 6. On the 2nd line, change `PoolHost=` into `Poolhost=pool.verus.io`\n 7. On the 3rd line, change `Port=` into 'Port=9999'\n 8. On the 4th line, change 'PublicVerusCoinAddress=' into `PublicVerusCoinAddress=RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ`\n    (make sure you use your own address!!!!)\n 9. On the 5th line, change `WorkerName=` into `WorkerName=MacOS` (or any name you want to identify your system)\n\nIn the next step we will set how many processor threads the miner will use. Make sure to use less threads than your processor has virtual cores. If you allow the miner to use all cores, your system will become sluggish at times, or it may even become completely unresponsive:\n 10) On the 6th line, change `Threads=` into `Threads=7` (fill in the amount of virtual cores you want to use)\n 11) Save and exit the file.\n\nWe have all the settings ready to go, but the file we just edited is not executable right now.\n 12. Click `Start.sh` and click `copy \"Start.sh\"`\n 13. Click in an empty space in you folder and click `Paste items`, which will result in a new `start copy.sh` file.\n 14. rename `start copy.sh` to `start.command`\nNow we have an executable file that will run when you doubleclick.\n 15. Doubleclick `start.command` and your machine will start mining.\n\nCreated by Oink.vrsc@.\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-02-26.",
