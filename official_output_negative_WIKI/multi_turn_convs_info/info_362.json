            "Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky not flag the software as malicious?",
            "Actually, Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program). These warnings are not because the software is malicious, but because it is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not malicious.",
