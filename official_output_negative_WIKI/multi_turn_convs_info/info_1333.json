Instead, it ensures that all notarizations are ultimately determined by miners and stakers, and finalized by witnesses who must follow the most power (stake+work) rules based on the protocol. The protocol requires alternating miners and stakers to post 3 consecutive, agreeing, progressing cross-chain notarizations, without intervening disagreement, to finalize a chain tip. This approach ensures maximum decentralization and a high cost to launch a DoS attack on the cross-chain protocol.",
