            "How do Verus blockchain launches always require a central authority to manage the launch process?",
            "Verus blockchain launches do not require a central authority to manage the launch process. In fact, they offer a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. This means that the launch process can be managed in a decentralized manner, without relying on a central authority.",

Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.

            "Can you explain why Verus blockchain launches always result in participants losing their pre-conversion funds if the minimum participation levels are not met?",
            "That's not correct. If the minimum participation levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. This means that participants will not lose their funds, but rather receive a refund if the minimum participation levels are not met.",
