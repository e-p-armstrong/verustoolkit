- content: You are checking whether a provided question and answer make sense if asked by themselves, with no additional information. You need to check for vague wording that a reader cannot interpret correctly, and questions that lack key context and would not be possibly answerable even if asked of someone with complete, masterful knowledge of the general subject matter of the question.

Evaluate the provided question-answer pair step-by-step. Following this, at the very end of your response, your "final judgment" or "final answer", you will write "Pass" or "Fail" or "Reword". A test passes if it "makes sense" and does not lack key context; it "Fails" if it lacks key context, AND the question is not specific or clear, it fails. If it lacks context but the question is specific, pointed, and grounded, then it needs to be reworded to have the context-needing terms (i.e., vague reference to "the text") removed. If it has no problems, it passes. 

I want you to especially check for vague references to "the text", "passage", and "book" that do not mention which book is being discussed. If no book is specifically named, the question and answer should not mention books or texts, etc.

Please now apply this method to the provided text and question, and write out your reasoning and thought process.

Question: What is the main theme of this book?
Answer: The main theme of the book is philosophical principles of chemistry, as opposed to experimental or practical data. This is evident from the line "In former times sciences like bridges, could only be built up by supporting them on a few broad buttresses and long girders. In addition to the exposition of the principles of chemistry, it has been my desire to show how science has now been built up like a suspension bridge, supported by the united strength of a number of slender, but firmly-fixed, chains, which individually are of little strength, and has thus been carried over difficulties which before appeared insuperable." This shows that the book focus is on philosophical principles rather than experimental data.'

### Question Context Validation
#### Special Term Context Check: specifically check for use of the terms "book", "text", "passage", and "excerpt" without context about which specific thing is being discussed. This question asks about "this book" without stating which book this is.
#### Text and Author Specificity: The question asks what the main theme of "this book" is, without mentioning which book is being referred to. It does not ask about any "author" or similar without providing context. Because of the vague reference to "this book", this fails.
#### Scope and Precision: The question asks about the "main theme" of the entire book, which is a broad question. Someone could feasibly know what the "main theme" of the book is, but when paired with a vague reference to "this book", this question is both vague and broad, and thus fails this step.

### Answer Context Validation:
#### Special Term Context Check: specifically check for use of the terms "book", "text", "passage", and "excerpt" without context about which specific thing is being discussed. This answer references "the book" without stating which book it is talking about.
#### Specificity and Clarity: The answer states what the main theme of "the book" is, without mentioning which book is being referred to. It does not reference any "author" or similar without providing context.  Because of the vague reference to "this book", this fails.
#### Answer-Only Context Issues: Confirm that the answer does not introduce new and vague context that the question does not. The answer mentions "the book", but this was already introduced by the question. The question''s doing so was flawed, but the answer still does not introduce new, vague context that the question does not. So this passes.

### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:
#### Evaluation: Some checks related to the question or answer failed. So this question and answer should be reworded if they can be, or fail otherwise. "What is the main theme of this book" asks a specific thing about a specific object (the book) so the question is precise. The question (and the answer) only lack context in mentioning *which* book they refer to. Therefore they will both be reworded.
#### Final judgement: Reword.

### Question Rewording (using text details as reference):
Question: What is the main theme of Principles of Chemistry, by Demitry Mendeleev?
Answer: The main theme of Principles of Chemistry is philosophical principles of chemistry, as opposed to experimental or practical data. This is evident from the line "In former times sciences like bridges, could only be built up by supporting them on a few broad buttresses and long girders. In addition to the exposition of the principles of chemistry, it has been my desire to show how science has now been built up like a suspension bridge, supported by the united strength of a number of slender, but firmly-fixed, chains, which individually are of little strength, and has thus been carried over difficulties which before appeared insuperable."

### Question Context Validation
#### Special Term Context Check: This question does not use terms like "book", "text", "passage", or "excerpt" without context, as it directly asks about Mendeleev''s view on a specific topic.
#### Text and Author Specificity: The question is specific and clear about what it''s asking regarding Mendeleev''s views on solutions.
#### Scope and Precision: The question is precise and focused, asking about Mendeleev''s considerations on a specific scientific topic.

### Answer Context Validation:
#### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "book", "text", "passage", and "excerpt" without context about which specific thing is being discussed. The answer references "his book" but fails to specify which book it is referring to.
#### Specificity and Clarity: While the answer is clear on Mendeleev''s view, it lacks specificity by not naming the book ''Principles of Chemistry''.
#### Answer-Only Context Issues: The answer introduces a vague reference to "his book", which is not specified in the question, thus lacking context.

### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:
#### Evaluation: Some checks related to the question or answer failed. So this question and answer should be reworded if they can be, or fail otherwise. The question is precise and relevant, but the answer introduces a lack of context by not specifying the book. This requires a rewording of the answer to include the specific reference. The question passed its checks and will remain untouched.

#### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "book", "text", "passage", and "excerpt" without context about which specific thing is being discussed. This question asks about "this passage" without stating which passage this is (or what book it belongs to).
#### Text and Author Specificity: The question fails to mention which passage or book is being referred to, leading to a lack of context.

#### Answer-Only Context Issues: The answer does not introduce new vague context that the question does not. However, both the question and answer lack necessary context.

### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:
#### Evaluation: Some checks related to the question or answer failed. So this question and answer should be reworded if they can be, or fail otherwise. Both the question and answer lack specific context about the "passage", making it impossible to determine which passage from ''Principles of Chemistry'' they are referring to. The question is precise in asking for a main theme but fails due to lack of context. Since context cannot be determined, even knowing what book the question is asking about, context cannot be added with rewording.
