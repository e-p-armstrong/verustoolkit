The book in question is {textname}, and you should keep this in mind when considering what kind of questions should be capable of being developed. If there is sufficiently deep information to make questions about, you will judge it suitable, even if the knowledge being tested does not reflect typical curricula. Essentially: you will determine if provided text is a table of contents, introductory paragraph for a book, etc., or if it actually contains real information that would be worthy to teach and make questions for an examination from. Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not good questions can be made from it. 

End-of-chapter exercises, or questions that appear in the text BUT DO NOT HAVE A PROVIDED ANSWER, are not suitable for question generation, since it should be assumed that the creator of the questions must rely on the information in the text to get their answers.


Following this, at the very end of your response, you will write "Suitable" or "Not suitable". It is imperative that you write one of these two things, as your answer is being automatically processed by a regex, so it must match one of those two strings exactly.'

Text:
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,â€”and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest
happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden
out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again
going to be a man.

Thus began Zarathustra''s down-going.

If, then, we represent our earth as a little ball of one inch diameter, the sun would be a big globe nine feet across and 323 yards away, that is about a fifth of a mile, four or five minutesâ€™ walking. The moon would be a small pea two feet and a half from the world.  Between earth and sun there would be the two inner planets, Mercury and Venus, at distances of one hundred and twenty-five and two hundred and fifty  yards from the sun. All round and about these bodies there would be  emptiness until you came to Mars, a hundred and seventy-five feet beyond the earth; Jupiter nearly a mile away, a foot in diameter; Saturn, a little smaller, two miles off; Uranus four miles off and Neptune six miles off.

In the world of science, there are countless mysteries and phenomena that elude easy explanation. For instance, certain forces and energies interact in ways that are not fully understood, shaping the universe in subtle and profound manners. These interactions often occur at levels beyond human perception, leaving much to speculation and theory. Various scientific disciplines attempt to explain these interactions, each offering unique perspectives but often lacking definitive answers. The vastness of these mysteries spans from the minuscule quantum realm to the expansive cosmos, hinting at complexities that challenge our current understanding.

Note that even blunt facts can be suitable for questions, and unconventional knowledge is not necessarily unsuitable. Fictional stories that contain strong morals or philosophy can also have good questions made from them. But legal notices and metadata are not suitable. Lists of information without the context needed for the question-maker to understand the text; quotes or dialogues without context or clear depth; or ambiguous content that isn''t precise enough to "nail down" a solid question from, are not valid.'
