    "How does Verus plan to handle distributed storage for large amounts of data, and what are the key requirements and goals for this system?",
    "Verus recognizes that traditional blockchain architecture is not well-suited for storing large amounts of data due to the massive duplication across the distributed network. Instead, Verus is exploring alternative distributed storage solutions, such as the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and Open DHT, to provide a more efficient and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data.\n\nThe key requirement for Verus is that mobile devices should be able to participate in the operation of the network. To achieve this, Verus is evaluating IPFS, which is a peer-to-peer file system based on the Kademlia protocol, and Open DHT, an efficient C++ library designed for use with small devices.\n\nVerus applications will assume that off-chain content is stored in IPFS and can be retrieved using hash commitments on the Verus blockchain to represent and index content. To ensure that content is available when needed, content owners must ensure that it is pinned in IPFS until it is no longer needed.\n\nIn the future, Verus aims to provide a more integrated and automatic storage solution that is blockchain-metered, allowing for more efficient and seamless data storage and retrieval. This could involve cross-blockchain integration with a decentralized payment/pinning solution or offering a simple service that charges in Verus to store and automatically pin content for specific lengths of time in IPFS.\n\nOverall, Verus's goal is to provide a scalable, efficient, and decentralized storage solution that can support the needs of decentralized applications (dApps) and other use cases, while also ensuring that mobile devices can participate in the network.",
    ", non-repudiable records and public key management, they are not the best solution for storing large amounts of data, due\nto their massive duplication across the distributed network. Instead, a better model for distributed storage would look something like the Interplanetary File System, or IPFS, which\nis a peer-to-peer file system based on the Kademlia [18]19 protocol in an implementation\nthat currently works well enough to use as storage for create/read/delete operations using\nhash commitments on the Verus blockchain to represent and index content.\nWhile we are evaluating the IPFS, we are also looking at other distributed hash table\nsolutions, such as Open DHT [26]. A key requirement for the Verus network is that mobile\ndevices be able to participate in its operation. Open DHT is an efficient C++ library intended\nfor use with small devices. IPFS does not yet seem to have much support for mobile at this\ntime, though it does have a Javascript library that can be used from the browser or mobile\napcancations [24].\nUntil IPFS is supplanted with another implementation, Verus applications will assume\nthat when off-chain content is needed, it should be retrieved from IPFS, and for future\ncompatibility, we will add a storage and version specifier. In order to store supporting poll\nor other content for dApps, the content owner must ensure that the content is pinned in\nIPFS, until it is no longer needed. By Phase IV, or earlier if there is significant demand,\nwe expect to either support or provide a blockchain-metered storage solution that is more\nintegrated and automatic to use for poll makers. Two options for such a system include\na cross-blockchain integration with a decentralized payment/pinning solution, or to offer\na simple service that charges in Verus to store and automatically pin content for specific\nlengths of time in IPFS.\n3.3.4",
