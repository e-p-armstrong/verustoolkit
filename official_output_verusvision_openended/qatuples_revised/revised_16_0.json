    "How does Verus approach privacy on its blockchain, and what are its goals for enabling private transactions on mobile devices?",
    "Verus is committed to ensuring privacy on its blockchain, dispelling the common misconception that all blockchain transactions are private. In reality, most blockchain transactions, including those on Bitcoin, are publicly visible, including the public addresses involved. To address this, Verus utilizes zk-SNARKs technology to enable provably anonymous transactions, ensuring that votes or transactions remain private unless disclosed by the voter or sender. This technology allows for verifiable transactions while maintaining the privacy of the parties involved.\n\nIn terms of mobile devices, Verus aims to support private transactions, known as z-transactions, on mobile phones. Currently, due to the high memory requirements of zk-SNARK transactions, mobile phones are not capable of generating these transactions. However, as zk-SNARK technology advances and becomes more efficient, Verus plans to integrate these improvements into its chain, enabling z-transactions and all Verus features on mobile devices.\n\nIn the interim, Verus will focus on providing a mobile wallet for transparent transactions, with the ultimate goal of enabling full privacy features on mobile devices as soon as possible. By doing so, Verus is committed to providing a secure, private, and accessible blockchain experience for its users.",
    "There is a fair amount of confusion among the public about privacy on the blockchain. One\ncommon belief is that Bitcoin transactions are private, when in fact all Bitcoin transactions,\nas well as the public addresses between which value is transferred, are public information [21].\nAs with the Verus token and its blockchain, poll autochains will also support zk-SNARKs\nto ensure that votes which have not been disclosed by a voter remain provably anonymous\nto all other parties, while still being verifiable by the person who holds the keys to the\naddress that cast them. Currently, based on standard smartphone hardware specifications\nand the memory requirements of zk-SNARK transactions, mobile phones cannot generate\nz-transactions. In coming releases of new Zcash technology this year, the z-transactions will\nbe more efficient and still provide the same privacy guarantees. When these technologies\nare available, we will work to support them on the Verus chain, as well as use the increased\nefficiency to enable z-transactions and all Verus features on mobile devices as soon as possible. Until that is available, we will work to provide a mobile wallet for Verus transparent\ntransactions.\n3.3.7Content Classification",
