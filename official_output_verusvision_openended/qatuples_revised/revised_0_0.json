    "How does the Virtue system in Verus enable participants to contribute to the classification and rating of content, and what benefits do miners receive from participating in this process?",
    "The Virtue system in Verus is a mechanism that allows identities with Virtue to participate in intrinsic polls, which are used to classify and rate content across Verus applications. These polls are made available to participants through a statistical lottery, and their participation is weighted by their measure of Virtue.\n\nBy participating in these polls, individuals can help the system classify and rate content, enabling a rating system that allows users to set preferences for the types of polls they wish to see. This approach promotes a decentralized and community-driven approach to content moderation, rather than relying on censorship.\n\nMiners also play a crucial role in this process by provisioning autochains for these intrinsic polls. In return, they receive rewards, which are equivalent to those received for setting up autochains for commissioned polls. The content for these polls is sourced from other polls, and is used to classify and rate those polls for easier discoverability and a better user experience.\n\nOverall, the Virtue system is designed to promote a decentralized and community-driven approach to content moderation, while also incentivizing participation and rewarding contributors.",
    "Once Virtue is activated, the Verus network itself will run specific, intrinsic polls that will\nbe regularly available to identities with Virtue, based on a statistical lottery and weighted\nby their actual measure of Virtue. Participating in these polls, which will be used to classify\ncontent and perform basic, human verification functions, enables participants to help the\nsystem classify and rate content across Verus applications, enabling a rating system rather\nthan censorship to allow each voter to set preferences for the ratings of polls they may wish\nto see.\nMiners who provision autochains for these intrinsic polls will get the same rewards as\nminers setting up autochains for commissioned polls. The content for these polls will be taken\nfrom other polls and will be used to classify and rate those polls for easier discoverability\nand the user experience of poll services.143.3.6Privacy",
