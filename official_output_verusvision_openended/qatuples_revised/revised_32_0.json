    "How does Verus aim to bridge the gap between centralized and decentralized identity systems, and what role do autochains play in enabling large-scale applications on the Verus network?",
    "Verus aims to provide a decentralized identity system that is compatible with centralized forms of identity, enabling people to optionally support Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations. This is achieved by supporting traditional forms of ID, such as biometric and government-issued IDs, via centralized or decentralized verification. However, these forms of ID are not required to establish or use decentralized identities on the Verus network.\n\nIn addition, Verus introduces autochains, which operate parallel to the main Verus chain and enable large-scale applications, such as polls or elections, to run simultaneously without congestion or excessive fees. Autochains allow users to provision their own secure blockchains, spawning dynamic parallel chains that can process thousands or potentially millions of transactions per second when needed. These autochains operate by proof of stake, providing security isolated to their direct user population, and are backed by Verus notarization and block time synchronization, ensuring the full weight of the PoW/PoS security layer and delayed proof of work (dPoW) notarization.\n\nThe vision of Verus is to create a decentralized identity system that is compatible with existing centralized systems, while providing a secure and scalable platform for large-scale applications. By leveraging autochains, Verus aims to enable secure, decentralized, and scalable solutions for various use cases, including polls, elections, and beyond.",
    "ovide as strong verification as today\u2019s centralized systems. At the same time, we\nbelieve it is important for practical reasons to enable compatibility with centralized forms of\nidentity and to enable people to optionally support KYC in identities. To enable a smooth\nbridge between centralized and decentralized identity systems, today\u2019s ID systems, including\nbiometric and government issued IDs, will be supported via centralized or decentralized\nverification to enable use of Verus identity in situations that require conformance to knowyour-customer (KYC) regulations. Theseforms of ID, however, are not required to establish\nor use even strong, decentralized identities on the Verus network.\nVerus autochains, will operate parallel to the main Verus chain and enable large-scale\napplications \u2013 such as polls or elections \u2013 to run simultaneously without concern for congestion or excessive fees. Autochains will enable poll application users to provision their\nown secure blockchains just by using the application \u2013 spawning dynamic parallel chains\nthat can process thousands (or potentially millions) of transactions per second when needed.\nAutochains will operate by proof of stake, enabling each chain to have security isolated to\nits direct user population. Autochains will also be backed by Verus notarization and block\ntime synchronization \u2013 providing the full weight of its PoW/PoS security layer as well as the\nKomodo platform\u2019s delayed proof of work (dPoW), to provide notarization all the way back\nto the full power of the actual Bitcoin blockchain.\nFor Phase II, what we expect to be an extended development phase, we will work to\nimplement autochains and their first application in the world. We will eventually use them\nto create, secure, scale, and perform polls for everything from classifying online content,\nto identifying real public opinion, to actual, real-time elections for ",
