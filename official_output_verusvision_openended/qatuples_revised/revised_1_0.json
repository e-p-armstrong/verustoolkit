    "What are the key features of Verus autochains, and how do they provide security and scalability? Additionally, what is the vision of the Verus Project, and how does it aim to enable societies and organizations to make decisions based on a more honest understanding of the public's actual beliefs?",
    "Verus autochains are a novel blockchain technology that provides unprecedented layered security and scalability. Here's how they work:\n\n**Security:** Verus autochains are layered over proof-of-work (PoW) and delayed proof-of-work (dPoW) security, all the way back to the real Bitcoin blockchain through Komodo. This means that each autochain has multiple layers of security, making it extremely difficult for a 51% attack to occur. In fact, on a Verus autochain, a 51% attack is more like winning a poll, as it requires consensus from a majority of voters.\n\n**Scalability:** Each poll or transaction on a Verus autochain is conducted on its own, automatically-created-and-validated blockchain, operating under its own visible validation rules. This means that each autochain can operate independently, without affecting the performance of other autochains, making the system highly scalable.\n\n**The Vision of Verus:** The Verus Project aims to use highly decentralized blockchain technology to enable all people to safely, anonymously, and confidently express their opinions on any issue. The project envisions a system where users can share their knowledge in a public forum, query a population of humans (or eventually both AIs and humans), and earn cryptocurrency in exchange for their contributions to collective knowledge.\n\n**Goals:** The primary goal of the Verus Project is to enable societies and organizations to make decisions based on a more honest understanding of the public's actual beliefs. To achieve this goal, the project prioritizes confidentiality, transparency, decentralization, and the development of a core platform that can leverage fully transparent blockchain technologies. By doing so, Verus aims to create a system that can be trusted, and that can facilitate decision-making based on accurate and unbiased information.",
    "\u2022 Secure \u2014 Our novel autochains \u2013 dynamic, security isolated, proof-of-stake (PoS)\nblockchains \u2013 are layered over proof-of-work (PoW) and delayed proof-of-work (dPoW)\nsecurity, all the way back to the real Bitcoin blockchain through Komodo.\nBy default, the first layer of security is run by the actual voters, themselves. Together,\nthis provides unprecedented layered security both in the autochain and in delayed\nproof-of-work, leveraging the network with the most hash power in the world.\nWe like to think that \u2013 on a Verus autochain \u2013 a 51% attack is called winning a poll.\n\u2022 Scalable \u2014 Each poll is conducted on its own, automatically-created-and-validated\nblockchain, operating under its own visible validation rules.2Our Vision for Verus Foundational ApplicationsThroughout history, understanding what a population truly thinks or feels has been an\ninvaluable capability. The manipulation of that understanding can, and has, repeatedly\nchanged the course of history.\nThe Verus Project plans to use highly decentralized blockchain technology to enable all\npeople to safely, anonymously, and confidently express their opinions \u2013 on any issue. Verus\nusers will be able to share their knowledge in a public forum, query a population of humans\n(or eventually both AIs and humans), quickly and effectively, and \u2013 importantly \u2013 earn\ncryptocurrency in exchange for these contributions to collective knowledge.\nA primary goal of the Verus Project is to enable societies and organizations to make\ndecisions based on a more honest understanding of the public\u2019s actual beliefs. To achieve\nthis goal, we consider the need for both confidentiality and transparency, to ensure that \u2013 first\nand foremost \u2013 the system can be trusted. It is also critical to prioritize decentralization and\ndevelop a core platform that can leverage fully transparent blockchain technologies, while\nrunning many applications that ",
