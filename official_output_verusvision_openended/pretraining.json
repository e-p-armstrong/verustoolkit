{"text": "Privacy, Community, Power\nVerus consensus non emitur\n\u201cTrue consensus cannot be bought\u201d - anonymous\n\nMichael J. Toutonghi\n\nMichael F. Toutonghi\nJune 12, 2018\n\nAlex R. English\n\n\fJune 12, 2018\nAbstract\nThe Verus Project aims to establish a secure, privacy-centric, fairly-distributed\ncryptocurrency. But \u2013 beyond this currency \u2013 Verus seeks to become much more than\na zero-knowledge privacy coin, one with two completely new highly-decentralizing proof\nof work and proof of stake algorithms.\nIn addition to payments, decentralization, and privacy features, Verus Project\nplans include its direct use as a currency for provisioning scalable and secure public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), for Verus applications built upon these parallel\nchains to scale. What this will do is simple: It will enable all people \u2013 as well as\nall nodes on the Verus network to participate in and benefit from a decentralized,\nblockchain service economy.\nThis paper details the Verus vision and describes the function of Verus as its own\nplatform, and also as a member of the Komodo platform ecosystem, in the context of its\nfirst applications. Verus core applications will provide a foundation to build additional\napplications and services, which will leverage Verus\u2019 automatically created blockchains,\ncalled autochains. Autochains \u2013 or PBaaS \u2013 will be provisioned and notarized by the\nVerus blockchain miners and stakers, in exchange for Verus currency.\nAutochains will be validated through proof-of-stake by their user populations. In\naddition to extremely scalable, dynamic, publicly-secured autochain applications, this\nwill add a dynamic isolation and security component to applications that can also\ncreate, manage, and verify transactions on the main Verus chain or any other Komodocompatible, Crypto-Conditions [17], Interledger Protocol [25] enabled blockchains.\nThe ways we apply this technology to our world \u2013 to our biggest contemporary\nchallenges \u2013 has the potential to completely remake the fabric of our society.\n\n1\n\n\fPreface\nHuman progress leapt forward with the invention of money. Money enabled worldwide,\ntrade-based economies to move from a primitive, barter-based system to a consensus-based\nvaluation and accounting of verifiable, storable, divisible, and scarce commodities as early\ncurrencies of exchange.\nEven in recent times, actual or perceived scarcity and authenticity of source, whether\ngenuine gold, an original giant coin of Micronesia [27] \u2013 or government backed notes with\ntrusted fiscal management and the ability to exchange for oil \u2013 provide the foundation of\nvalue upon which, ultimately, human resources are bought and sold.\nWhat blockchain does is straightforward. It enables the creation of cryptographic tools\nand applications that do nothing less than provide us with a new future of programmable\nmoney. This programmable money integrates directly with existent accounting functions\nand, eventually, with all automated services. Blockchain technologies provide humans with\na new, verifiable solution to ensure scarcity, authenticity of source, inbuilt transferability,\nfungibility through privacy, and programmable rules. More than that, fully peer to peer,\npublic blockchains disintermediate and provide tools that offer the opportunity to revitalize our economic systems and societies, potentially creating a more equitable and honest\neconomic framework for all.\n\nAbout This Document\nThis vision paper is not intended as a technical reference, but as a vehicle to communicate\nour vision, our plans, and our thinking \u2013 as we work on realizing the true potential of Verus.\nAll technologies described are based on a clear understanding of methods intended to\nimplement each solution but \u2013 as with any project \u2013 the specific implementation details will\nbe refined as we actually realize their functionality. To supplement this vision paper, we\nwill follow soon after its initial release with a white paper, describing the new technologies\ndeveloped for Verus Coin\u2019s initial launch, what benefits they provide, and provide details of\ntheir implementation. We will continue to supplement this vision paper with white papers,\nas appropriate, for each completed phase of Verus Coin\u2019s development, in the future.\nAs of this point, we have completed Phase 1, having released Verus Coin with zero\nknowledge privacy, two brand new algorithms combined for simultaneous CPU-mineable\nproof of work (POW) and fair proof of stake (POS) consensus, in-wallet mining and staking\non PCs, leverage of and support for advanced Komodo platform technologies, and wallets\nand miners for every major PC operating system.\n\n2\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nInformation vies for our attention in today\u2019s digital world, trying to convince us of what\nproduct to use or which politician to believe. We are watched and measured as we react to\nthat information, in order to convince us what to buy or to believe. This is an active process\nthat exploits our lack of online privacy \u2013 combined with weaknesses in human psychology \u2013\nin order to make profit; extracting value from, even affecting our behavior, learning about\nand influencing each of us individually to open our wallets or add our voices to another\u2019s\nagenda.\nNo single person can digest and fully understand \u2013 let alone verify \u2013 a fraction of the\ninformation thrust at us in daily life. We are told to give up on the notion of privacy and to\ntrust networks of companies with our most private data, our identity, our credit histories, our\nlocation, our habits. We are also told that our voices are lost in the digital sea of information.\nYet how is this the same sea through which we are laser-targeted based on correlating our\nbehaviors to learn so much about us, individually? What if these technologies could be\nturned towards the benefit of society, first \u2013 and then allowed to support businesses, in that\ncontext?\nWe on the Verus team believe it is possible to support businesses and governments\nrequirements with digital systems that: 1) respect your privacy, 2) give you control over\nyour data, and 3) enable you to speak your mind with the anonymous authority of an\nauthorized voter or member of a community, in a way that can directly be heard and affect\nactual change.\nBefore we explain how, it would help to understand the shared beliefs behind our vision\nfor Verus. These beliefs underpin everything we build into the Verus network:\n1. We believe that every human has ideas, knowledge, and value to contribute to our\nsociety. By using technology to reward people for their contributions, we can enable\neach of our verifiable, yet anonymous voices to be heard as a collective truth.\n2. We believe that those who contribute positively over time to the system should be\nrewarded for that contribution and provided with ongoing incentive.\n3. We believe that a world-scale, peer-to-peer system that can enable humans to be\nqueried directly, confidentially, verifiably \u2013 and in a transparent manner \u2013 can directly\nprovide populations of people and the world with valuable, transformative tools.\nWith Verus, we will introduce digital tools to enable us all to build a better world\ntogether. We will monetarily incentivize \u2013 with our technologies \u2013 behavior that strengthens\ncommunities and institutions. This is the thing that\u2019s missing in the online world today:\nFiscal incentive for communal behavior built into the very fabric of its function.\nThe Verus Project\u2019s tools will make it easy to create an identity \u2013 or multiple identities\n\u2013 on the Verus multi-blockchain system, which can accumulate value and even have multiple\npersonas, each to represent a facet of your identity as a whole. This reflects how we might\nexpress identity in our personal or professional lives, where some situations call for provable credibility, yet others require no more information than what you might reveal when\nencountering a casual stranger.\n3\n\n\fEach identity will have its own, unique address. Unless its owner reveals information\nto link two or more identities, it is cryptographically hard \u2013 meaning virtually impossible\n\u2013 to correlate one identity to another. At the same time, the owner of an identity can still\ncryptographically verify statements made about identities under their control, attesting to\nidentity properties (such as passport, age, height, citizenship, photo, etc.) as strongly as\nis possible with today\u2019s digital technology. As part of the Verus vision, to be described in\nmore detail in later phases, we intend to support fully decentralized verification of identities\nthat can provide as strong verification as today\u2019s centralized systems. At the same time, we\nbelieve it is important for practical reasons to enable compatibility with centralized forms of\nidentity and to enable people to optionally support KYC in identities. To enable a smooth\nbridge between centralized and decentralized identity systems, today\u2019s ID systems, including\nbiometric and government issued IDs, will be supported via centralized or decentralized\nverification to enable use of Verus identity in situations that require conformance to knowyour-customer (KYC) regulations. Theseforms of ID, however, are not required to establish\nor use even strong, decentralized identities on the Verus network.\nVerus autochains, will operate parallel to the main Verus chain and enable large-scale\napplications \u2013 such as polls or elections \u2013 to run simultaneously without concern for congestion or excessive fees. Autochains will enable poll application users to provision their\nown secure blockchains just by using the application \u2013 spawning dynamic parallel chains\nthat can process thousands (or potentially millions) of transactions per second when needed.\nAutochains will operate by proof of stake, enabling each chain to have security isolated to\nits direct user population. Autochains will also be backed by Verus notarization and block\ntime synchronization \u2013 providing the full weight of its PoW/PoS security layer as well as the\nKomodo platform\u2019s delayed proof of work (dPoW), to provide notarization all the way back\nto the full power of the actual Bitcoin blockchain.\nFor Phase II, what we expect to be an extended development phase, we will work to\nimplement autochains and their first application in the world. We will eventually use them\nto create, secure, scale, and perform polls for everything from classifying online content,\nto identifying real public opinion, to actual, real-time elections for an organization or \u2013\nconceivably \u2013 a government.\nOur goal is to make these polls easy to use from a PC or mobile device, yet industrial\nstrength and suitable for serious, secure elections. They will leverage the latest cryptographic\ntechnologies for privacy \u2013 known as zero-knowledge proofs \u2013 to preserve confidentiality.\nThey will be:\n\u2022 Confidential \u2014 No one but the voter knows who or what they voted for \u2013 unless the\nvoter discloses. Results of the vote can be withheld until the vote is complete, at which\ntime they can be released to everyone, simultaneously.\n\u2022 Verifiable \u2014 Only voters that are authorized to vote can vote. Each voter can vote\nonly once. Each voter can look at the released results and see that their vote was\ncounted.\n\u2022 Transparent \u2014 Anyone can validate the number of votes counted, and the number\nof votes,each person or selection received.\n\n4\n\n\f\u2022 Secure \u2014 Our novel autochains \u2013 dynamic, security isolated, proof-of-stake (PoS)\nblockchains \u2013 are layered over proof-of-work (PoW) and delayed proof-of-work (dPoW)\nsecurity, all the way back to the real Bitcoin blockchain through Komodo.\nBy default, the first layer of security is run by the actual voters, themselves. Together,\nthis provides unprecedented layered security both in the autochain and in delayed\nproof-of-work, leveraging the network with the most hash power in the world.\nWe like to think that \u2013 on a Verus autochain \u2013 a 51% attack is called winning a poll.\n\u2022 Scalable \u2014 Each poll is conducted on its own, automatically-created-and-validated\nblockchain, operating under its own visible validation rules.\n\n2\n\nOur Vision for Verus Foundational Applications\n\nThroughout history, understanding what a population truly thinks or feels has been an\ninvaluable capability. The manipulation of that understanding can, and has, repeatedly\nchanged the course of history.\nThe Verus Project plans to use highly decentralized blockchain technology to enable all\npeople to safely, anonymously, and confidently express their opinions \u2013 on any issue. Verus\nusers will be able to share their knowledge in a public forum, query a population of humans\n(or eventually both AIs and humans), quickly and effectively, and \u2013 importantly \u2013 earn\ncryptocurrency in exchange for these contributions to collective knowledge.\nA primary goal of the Verus Project is to enable societies and organizations to make\ndecisions based on a more honest understanding of the public\u2019s actual beliefs. To achieve\nthis goal, we consider the need for both confidentiality and transparency, to ensure that \u2013 first\nand foremost \u2013 the system can be trusted. It is also critical to prioritize decentralization and\ndevelop a core platform that can leverage fully transparent blockchain technologies, while\nrunning many applications that respect privacy. With Verus, these applications can leverage\nzero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge \u2013 or zk-SNARKs \u2013 the most\nreliable and tested iteration of proven, zero-knowledge privacy technology available today.\nOur novel approach ensures that this technology can be used at scale, across any population size, throughout the world. Using the tested-at-scale infrastructure and tools of the\nKomodo platform, and Verus planned development of PBaaS \u2013 the Verus developers will\nbuild human organizational tools, including voting and fully self-sovereign identity with a\nreputation system that respects privacy. The goal, here, is a significant one, and these tools\nare planned in a way to allow entire human populations to transparently and directly share\ntheir knowledge and opinions \u2013 without the risk of privacy violation, spin or censorship.\nVerus tools will also leverage human (and eventually non-human) intelligence at scale\nto solve previously challenging problems in a decentralized manner \u2013 financially rewarding\nthose who contribute to their proper function.\nTo serve all people in the world simultaneously with these public, peer-to-peer tools,\nVerus introduces autochains. Autochains are a novel scaling model for blockchain systems.\nAutochains will enable full node miners to provide public blockchain provisioning services.\nThese services will occur in transient, parallel chains, chains that are isolated from congestion,\ndisruption, or interference from the main Verus blockchain. As an autochain operates, it is\n5\n\n\falmost completely parallel and isolated from the main Verus chain, except for the capability\nof posting transactions and proofs to Verus, for results and coordination across applications\nor people.\nBy combining privacy, polls at scale, and identity, Verus can be used to post polls and\nask almost any question of a population or subpopulation of people, receive an honest \u2013 and,\nimportantly \u2013 verifiable answer, and still respect the privacy of the respondents. When even\nthe first support for polling is active on the Verus network, the Verus community will be\nable to vote on the long term direction of the Verus Project, itself.\nOver time, Verus polls \u2013 used for purposes such as determining the accuracy of news\nonline, for research, or even for political polling, will be combined with machine learning\nto enable all of us, as a society, to benefit directly from our collective intelligence without\ntoday\u2019s risks to our individual privacy. Verus will combine auditability and verifiability of\ntransactions with the option of verified, confidential participation \u2013 meaning societies and\norganizations can directly understand what people think, feel, and believe, as populations \u2013\nwithout taking control of their personal data or targeting some individuals, based on their\nanswers or beliefs.\nUltimately, our vision for the Verus Project is to enable us all to directly participate\nin our own worldwide economy. Verus applications will enable any individual to speak up\nwith the power of an authorized participant \u2013 and with the confidence of anonymity \u2013 to\nproduce a verifiable, transparent, and honest flow of information throughout the globe. It\nwill transform the way that anonymity functions in our current technological environment \u2013\nprioritizing cooperation and providing the financial incentive for that cooperation to occur.\n\n3\n\nImportant Verus Concepts\n\nThe longer term Verus Project vision of a better society through public blockchain services\nrelies upon three fundamental pillars \u2013where the correct operation of each strengthens the\nothers in the form of a virtuous circle.\nThese pillars are:\n1. Extreme transaction throughput and scalable decentralized applications with autochains,\nwhich provide public blockchains as a service (PBaaS)\n2. Selectively strong, private identity, and\n3. Open application support with a foundation of polls, voting, and lottery selection\nservices.\nEach of these pillars will help us process human knowledge, understanding, and/or opinion on any content or topic. Together, they will enable direct querying \u2013 with confidential\nand truthful \u2013 answers across an entire population. It will create a secure, public platform\nthat respects privacy, and can potentially serve as the foundation of a more respectful society.\nIt is also important to know about the the concept of Verus Virtue when reading further\nin this document. The best way to think about Virtue for the purposes of this document\nis as a separate currency that can be earned, but not purchased or sold, and is part of the\n6\n\n\fevolution of the Verus proof-of-stake algorithm, slated for later phases of the Verus project.\nProof of Virtue is a technology that will be described in much greater detail and implemented\nin later phases of the Verus project.\n\n3.1\n\nAutochains\n\nWith Verus, we plan to create a platform upon which we will build voting and even election\nsystems that support our vision of enabling a better society through blockchain.\nTo run simultaneous polls across disparate populations on one blockchain-based system,\nwe need another dimension of information \u2013 one that retains privacy, and is anchored to a\nprimary store of value, Verus.\nOne approach to creating another dimension of meaning would be a system of \u201ccoloring.\u201d\nThe Ethereum blockchain system and some layers over Bitcoin or Bitcoin compatible coins\nuse a version of a coloring system. [5][6][7][8]. While, at first glance, this seems like a\nreasonable approach, it is actually a suboptimal solution, at best.\nWith Ethereum and the ICO experiences of 2017 [9][10], we now know what happens when\nyou create one blockchain and overload it with transactions: Congestion and unnecessarily\nhigh fees. Developers have proposed many solutions to this problem of scaling \u2013 including\na move to proof-of-stake systems and sharding (effectively trying to separate the various\n\n7\n\n\ffunctions on a blockchain), or even a move to large systems of parallel chains with a common\ndesign.\nYet instead of implementing a \u201csolution\u201d with colored coins sharing one blockchain, we\nhave decided to take a completely new approach to this problem. Our approach will not\nonly provide an extra dimension of information and an unlimited number of token types,\nor \u201ccolors\u201d, but it will do so with highly scalable PBaaS autochains, which also reward\nVerus miners and node operators as provisioning agents. This is a novel method of scaling,\none which provides significant scale and security benefits through isolation of transaction\nprocessing for each application instance on its own blockchain.\nRather than thinking of Verus as a single blockchain, it is more appropriate\nto think of it as a blockchain-based system, one that is rooted in a primary value\nchain.\nAutochains are exactly what they sound like \u2013 automatically instantiated blockchains\nthat are validated initially \u2013 and when notarizing \u2013 by Verus miners, and otherwise, only by\ntheir users, often a disjoin set from the whole of Verus users. Autochains, once instantiated,\ncan be used indefinitely or can have a finite lifetime to be used for a specific purpose. In\nthis document, we will often discuss autochains in the context of a few concrete applications\nthat we intend to implement on the Verus network. It is important to keep in mind that\ntheir versatility is basically unlimited. Due to their security being inherited from the main\nVerus chain, autochains eliminate perhaps the biggest disadvantage that creating consensusbased distributed ledger applications suffers from: Weak defense against attacks in their\nearliest stages.\nIn Phase II, Verus will define an autochain provisioning protocol, and specific voting\nprotocols, based on blockchain transactions. These protocols will include zero knowledge\nproofs, Crypto Conditions [17], and Interledger Protocol [25] technologies to provide proper\nincentive for all participants to engage in the automatic creation and use of on-demand,\nisolated or public blockchains, ones that rest on a secure, public foundation.\nThe autochain protocol will also provide the ability to place a value on the data generated\nby the autochain\u2019s operation. This value will then either be released to the public or paid\nout, through rewards, to the participants in the creation of that data. This creates a model\nthat incentivizes release of learning and information to the public \u2013 also making applications\nwhich do so much less expensive to run.\nFor Verus poll applications, validation will default to a form of proof-of-stake (PoS),\nwhere all members of the chain are stakers. This is because that security model matches\nexactly the interests of the majority of voters in having an accurate record. Because PoS does\nnot involve powerful mining equipment or competition to solve a cryptographic puzzle, it can\noperate on much less powerful hardware\u2013 even on mobile devices. Since voters, themselves,\nsecure the chain simply by running the voting software, poll chains are generally not affected\nby activity on the main Verus chain (except when posting interledger transactions). In\naddition, an autochain\u2019s operation, independent of scale, adds no overhead or congestion to\nthe main Verus chain\u2019s transaction load \u2013 besides the transactions to provision the poll chain\nand post results back to the main chain itself.\nSince we want to be able to create autochains from clients that may not be running full\nnodes or even own stable IP addresses, full nodes will be incentivized to provide reliable\nstatic node support for autochains. Once they provide this support, they will be recognized\n8\n\n\fby validators on the autochain. They will then be able to use this recognition to boost their\nreputation for selection in future lotteries.\nBy advertising autochain node support on the main blockchain \u2013 along with a stable\npayment address via a transaction \u2013 the node IP can be selected in a random lottery. The\nEigentrust ratings of all nodes can then be recorded by all other nodes that serve the chain\nat regular intervals. Nodes which consistently offer better QoS will get better ratings. Nodes\nthat get poorly rated will still share in the node rewards for the current blockchain \u2013 but\nwill be less likely to be selected in the next node lottery.\n\n9\n\n\f3.2\n3.2.1\n\nThe Virtue Autochain\nRoots of Trust in Distributed Consensus\n\nThe Bitcoin [14] proof of work implementation introduced the world to systems that establish\ntrust, not due to belief in any individual human\u2019s behavior, but based on the tendency of\nhumans to act in their own self-interest.\nThe Bitcoin protocol rewards winners of a contest, referred to as \u201cminers\u201d, in statistical\nproportion to the computing power they employ to \u201cmine\u201d for Bitcoin, as compared to the\ntotal computing power of all miners. For every block of validated transactions added to\nthe Bitcoin blockchain, someone wins a competition to earn the right to define that block\nwhile adhering to specific, verifiable rules. The competition involves verifiably solving a\nstatistical mathematical puzzle that is specific to exactly that block, meaning the same work\ncannot be reused on any other block. The winner of each competition earns the right to\naccurately process the next block of pending Bitcoin transactions and to claim a specific\nmeasure of Bitcoin, called the \u201cblock reward\u201d (plus fees of all transactions in the block that\nwas processed).\nMining competition serves to determine the amount of computing power a would-be\nattacker would have to control in order to mine of blocks that were not earned according to\nthe intended rules, execute transactions that might otherwise be rejected, and prevent certain\ntransactions from executing altogether. Based on the way that miners achieve consensus\non what is the correct chain, forging a false Bitcoin chain to achieve this would require\nan attacker to control more than 50% of the total power of all miners \u2013 both honest and\nbyzantine.\nSince, right now, it is likely infeasible for any single actor to mount such an attack against\nBitcoin, the largest network of hash power today, this type of competition, called proof-ofwork (PoW), currently manages hundreds of billions of dollars of value, sends transactions of\nthat value to anyone, anywhere, at any time, and does this all without any company, bank,\nor trusted third party, of any kind.\nIn addition to enabling secure management of large sums of money, PoW has also sparked\na mining arms race and significant investment in computing power to claim Bitcoins and other\ncryptocurrencies, creating the equivalent of the world\u2019s largest distributed supercomputer\ndoing nothing but the same calculations, albeit on different data, over and over again. As\na result, one side effect of the public blockchains\u2019 PoW security system is massive power\nconsumption and significant ecological cost.\nDue to this, a great deal of research and development has gone into alternative consensus\nmechanisms [11][12][13]. Most serious PoW alternatives center around the concept of proofof-stake (PoS) \u2013 the idea, that by putting something at stake commensurate with the value\nbeing transacted in the transaction flow, a rational staking person, known as a \u201cvalidator,\u201d\nwill choose good behavior within the ecosystem, so as not to lose their \u201cstake.\u201d\nEven though large systems are being built that depend on 100% PoS, there remains\ncontroversy over its robustness when users have incompatible interests, or when an attacker\u2019s\nstake is not valued as highly as the perceived value to be gained by corrupting the system.\nMost modern PoS and PoW systems make a fundamental assumption about all miners; that they are either \u2018byzantine\u2019, and intend to compromise the system as a whole, or\n\n10\n\n\f\u2018rational\u2019, in statistically the same proportions for all participants equally. One need only\nconsider that if there was a way to learn a more accurate statistical function for each participant\u2019s probability of being either byzantine or rational, using such a function to determine\nwho participates in the system\u2019s validation would improve its resistance to attack.\nIn fact, any accurate method of recognizing those who were attempting to strengthen\nthe system \u2013 and thus who could statistically be more trusted than a byzantine or even\naverage participant \u2013 could both decrease the power consumption and ecological cost of\nblockchain security and further strengthen resistance to attack. This then brings up the\nquestion: \u201cHow do we recognize trustworthy participants?\u201d\nSome methods studied and proven effective are the Eigentrust reputation management\nalgorithm [20], and its improved derivative the Eigentrust++ mechanism implemented in the\nNEM blockchain [22]. Originally designed by Sep Kamvar, Mario Glosser and Hector GarciaMolina in 2003, the Eigentrust algorithm is built to function on peer-to-peer networks. It\naims to isolate byzantine actors in said networks by assigning each peer a public, global trust\nvalue based on their history of activity \u2013 clearly displaying a form of \u201crating\u201d for each peer.\nThose with lower ratings are shown not to be trustworthy, and thus, are interacted with less\nby their peers.\nSimply put, the algorithm assumes that if any given peer a trusts any given peer b,\nthen it would also trust the peers trusted by b. Every peer calculates a local trust value\nfor each other peer it has interacted with, based on the either satisfactory or unsatisfactory\ntransactions it has had with each one. These local trust values are determined by each peer,\nand when peer a wants to know if they should trust peer b, say, before making a transaction,\npeer a would ask all other peers it knows to report on their local trust values of peer b and\nweigh their responses according to the trust values peer a has for each of them.\n3.2.2\n\nProof of Virtue (PoV) Reward System\n\nUsing a model similar to the EigenTrust algorithm, Verus will introduce the idea of Proof of\nVirtue (PoV) enhancement to the PoS algorithm initially released in Phase I. In PoV, we\nintend to weight staking contests with both Verus stake and \u201cVirtue\u201d, a special \u201ccurrency\u201d,\nexpected to be tracked on a Virtue autochain, and used as a trust rating of identities within\nthe network.\nIn a similar way to the \u201camount of stake\u201d used when staking, Virtue will add another\ncomponent to the probability of being selected to process a block of transactions on the\nVerus Network. Its probabilities upon introduction will not change returns on the Verus PoS\nsystem, but addresses will gradually be able to improve earnings with a Virtue weighting \u2013\nbased on recorded activity and behavior.\nIn order to ensure that Virtue is both a rare and valued property, which drives correct\nbehavior, it will neither be purchased, nor sold. Verus holders will have opportunities to\nearn a small measure of Virtue, which can then be further increased by staking the Virtue\nitself, when attesting to a fact for the network, validating information, or providing another\nmeasurable benefit to the network.\nSince Virtue will have intrinsic value on the Verus network, there will be methods for\ntransferring it through wallet ownership \u2013 for cases of probate or other necessity \u2013 but such\nbehavior as a tool for trading in virtue will not provide a secure or intended method of\n11\n\n\fexchange.\nThe Proof of Virtue model will effectively be a modified form of PoS that is not based\njust on monetary value, but also on long term measurement of contribution, which will affect\ntrustworthiness and earning power in the Verus network. The intent is to provide opportunities for more people to participate in the growth of a positive functioning network and\nto prevent potential attackers from being able to easily buy their way into an attack, adding\nyet another layer of security.\nWe expect to keep the PoW component as part of Verus security system for an indefinite\nperiod of time. We also expect to leverage the dPoW security of Komodo and its notarization\ninto the Bitcoin blockchain as well.\n\n3.3\n3.3.1\n\nPolls, Voting, and Elections\nThe Importance of Secure Polling\n\nA great deal of research has delved into the best way to achieve confidential, verifiable, and\ntransparent (CVT) elections electronically \u2013 with a few notable systems actually used in\nreal life situations. These attempts, however, have been plagued with significant limitations,\nlimitations that almost always risked either revealing the identity of a voter and thus eliminating confidentiality, or allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate voters, and put the\nvalidity of the vote into question [1].\nThis was shown in one of the first majorly adopted North American electronic voting\nsystems, the Diebold AccuVote TS, which was announced in the year 2000 [4], at a time\nwhen, as a result of the Florida 2000 presidential election, the general public began to\nrecognize numerous flaws in the widely-used punch card voting system [2]. Despite multiple\nstudies discussing electronic voting systems \u2013 studies which clearly warned of security risks\nsuch as insider threats, issues with auditing, and network vulnerabilities \u2013 by 2004, the\nAccuvote TS system was deployed for major political elections in 37 US states [2], resulting\nin multiple serious problems that impact the legitimacy of numerous election results since,\ndue to inherent flaws in its design that were never fully addressed [3].\nFirstly, the \u201csolution\u201d that the system introduced to deal with voters submitting multiple ballots \u2013 and to solve the ballot anonymity problem \u2013 was to issue a single personal\nvoting \u2018smartcard\u2019 to each vote. This smartcard, unfortunately, did not contain a complete\nidentity, but instead contained a common election key among voters that voting machines\nsimply checked to determine if the card belonged in the correct election [2]. The lack of\nany cryptographic unique identification on these cards was a significant security flaw, as\nuser-programmable smart cards and readers almost instantly became commercially available\non the internet for reasonable prices \u2013 making it extremely easy to mass produce homemade\ncopies. Furthermore, due to the lack of a truly secure boot loader, operating system, or application, the system had numerous potential attack vectors, many of which were quite simple\nfor an adversary. For example, any attacker with access to the operating system had the\nability to modify ballot program files through the standard Windows Explorer application\nalready included on each machine.\nThese serious failures in previously adopted electronic voting systems have literally\nchanged the course of history, affecting the outcomes of major political elections that\n12\n\n\fdecide the state of world politics. This highlights the importance of creating a system that\nis truly confidential, verifiable and transparent, and indicates the magnitude of one problem\nwe plan to solve with Verus.\n3.3.2\n\nRunning, Recording, and Scaling Polls - Transient, PoS Chains\n\nUsing autochains, Verus will dynamically create parallel voting chains on demand for each\npoll in its ecosystem. This creates improved, isolated security and allows for scaling in a\nvirtually unlimited manner.\nThe Verus wallet, which will be used for voting, will also have the ability to validate blocks\nthrough proof-of-stake, blocks which, when enabled, will allow voters who are validating the\nelection to earn rewards. These rewards will either be paid in Virtue for intrinsic polls, when\navailable, or from outputs of the payment transaction that instantiated the poll. When a\npoll is complete, results are posted back to the main Verus chain. The chain used to run it\ncan then be archived or deleted, and it is typically abandoned.\n3.3.3\n\nPoll Content and Distributed Hash Tables\n\nWhile blockchains make excellent databases for permanent, non-repudiable records and public key management, they are not the best solution for storing large amounts of data, due\nto their massive duplication across the distributed network. Instead, a better model for distributed storage would look something like the Interplanetary File System, or IPFS, which\nis a peer-to-peer file system based on the Kademlia [18]19 protocol in an implementation\nthat currently works well enough to use as storage for create/read/delete operations using\nhash commitments on the Verus blockchain to represent and index content.\nWhile we are evaluating the IPFS, we are also looking at other distributed hash table\nsolutions, such as Open DHT [26]. A key requirement for the Verus network is that mobile\ndevices be able to participate in its operation. Open DHT is an efficient C++ library intended\nfor use with small devices. IPFS does not yet seem to have much support for mobile at this\ntime, though it does have a Javascript library that can be used from the browser or mobile\napcancations [24].\nUntil IPFS is supplanted with another implementation, Verus applications will assume\nthat when off-chain content is needed, it should be retrieved from IPFS, and for future\ncompatibility, we will add a storage and version specifier. In order to store supporting poll\nor other content for dApps, the content owner must ensure that the content is pinned in\nIPFS, until it is no longer needed. By Phase IV, or earlier if there is significant demand,\nwe expect to either support or provide a blockchain-metered storage solution that is more\nintegrated and automatic to use for poll makers. Two options for such a system include\na cross-blockchain integration with a decentralized payment/pinning solution, or to offer\na simple service that charges in Verus to store and automatically pin content for specific\nlengths of time in IPFS.\n3.3.4\n\nVoting Models and Types of Polls\n\nVerus will support numerous types of polls, those that use weighted or unweighted voting,\nthat seek to expose truth or opinions, and polls that rate and choose collectively. In order to\n13\n\n\fcreate a sensible taxonomy for polls, one that people will understand, we define the following\ntypes of voting:\n1. Multiple choice\n2. Weighted multiple choice\n3. Ranking\n4. Rating\nWe also define the following types of polls:\n1. Polls to classify\n2. Polls to select\n3. Polls to rank\n4. Polls to rate\nWe do not expect Verus to support all voting and poll types in the early phases. In fact,\nuntil Phase IV, the Verus core team plans to focus on known requirements of multiple choice\nand weighted multiple choice voting. During or after completion of Phase IV, expanding\nsupport for voting and poll types will be higher priority.\nEach type of Verus poll may support confidential or public voting, live or delayed poll\nresults, online or offline vote authorization, and lottery selected vote authorization. We will\nroll out working vote models in phases, as well, initially providing solutions for weighted and\nunweighted selection voting, which fits well for both political and opinion polls as well as\ncontent classification and ID verification.\n3.3.5\n\nIntrinsic Polls\n\nOnce Virtue is activated, the Verus network itself will run specific, intrinsic polls that will\nbe regularly available to identities with Virtue, based on a statistical lottery and weighted\nby their actual measure of Virtue. Participating in these polls, which will be used to classify\ncontent and perform basic, human verification functions, enables participants to help the\nsystem classify and rate content across Verus applications, enabling a rating system rather\nthan censorship to allow each voter to set preferences for the ratings of polls they may wish\nto see.\nMiners who provision autochains for these intrinsic polls will get the same rewards as\nminers setting up autochains for commissioned polls. The content for these polls will be taken\nfrom other polls and will be used to classify and rate those polls for easier discoverability\nand the user experience of poll services.\n\n14\n\n\f3.3.6\n\nPrivacy\n\nThere is a fair amount of confusion among the public about privacy on the blockchain. One\ncommon belief is that Bitcoin transactions are private, when in fact all Bitcoin transactions,\nas well as the public addresses between which value is transferred, are public information [21].\nAs with the Verus token and its blockchain, poll autochains will also support zk-SNARKs\nto ensure that votes which have not been disclosed by a voter remain provably anonymous\nto all other parties, while still being verifiable by the person who holds the keys to the\naddress that cast them. Currently, based on standard smartphone hardware specifications\nand the memory requirements of zk-SNARK transactions, mobile phones cannot generate\nz-transactions. In coming releases of new Zcash technology this year, the z-transactions will\nbe more efficient and still provide the same privacy guarantees. When these technologies\nare available, we will work to support them on the Verus chain, as well as use the increased\nefficiency to enable z-transactions and all Verus features on mobile devices as soon as possible. Until that is available, we will work to provide a mobile wallet for Verus transparent\ntransactions.\n3.3.7\n\nContent Classification\n\nWhile Verus is designed to provide invaluable tools to people across the world, any system\nwithout censorship will also inevitably allow the underbelly of humanity to show through.\nThat means that while we would want all people to participate, we recognize that in order\nfor that to provide the most positive experience for all participants, we must use the Verus\npoll system itself to recognize, rate, and classify the content on its network, enabling those\nwho provide such a service through participation in polls to earn, while enabling the selective\nfiltering of content based on value judgements and classification of honest populations.\nWhile we recognize that the best early use case for such capability is in rating and\nclassifying non-intrinsic polls themselves, the ability to classify content is a fundamental\nstrength that Verus will increasingly develop over time. At first, we expect such classification\nto be applied to relatively simple tasks for humans, such as identifying toxic comments, hate\nspeech, or categories of information. Even though these types of classification systems have\nlargely employed machine learning systems running against privately curated training data,\nour vision is for Verus content classification to enable people to earn, as they classify content\nbetter than any machine learning system, but in a way that can be followed by the best\nmachine learning algorithms, and generalized at scale.\n3.3.8\n\nTruth vs. Opinion\n\nWhen classifying content, especially when you start to consider challenging classifications,\nsuch as misleading, propaganda, generally accepted fact, accurate versions of history, vs.\nclassification of what should generally be accepted as toxic or rated content that people could\nreasonably answer objectively, one must consider the difference between fact and opinion.\nSelecting the winner of an election is a matter of expressing an opinion. Classifying content\naccording to level of toxicity is a question of determining the factual answer to the question:\nwhat does the majority of the voting population believe the classification to be. Determining\n\n15\n\n\fwhether an image in one photo is the same image as that from another is a question with\nan objective, if not determinable answer.\nTo ensure that Verus polls support polls that attempt to discover accepted truths, facts,\nand even credible emerging arguments, Verus voters will often be able to stake and either\nearn or lose Verus and in later phases, Virtue, by answering in a manner that matches\nconsensus. For other polls, which are recognized as opinion polls, all answers are equally\nvalid contributions.\n\n3.4\n\nRandom Sampling as a Service\n\nThe Verus system will randomized selection for many of its functions, similar to its Phase I\nPoS block validation system. Blockchain lotteries will be generalized and used for selection\nof participants in randomized polls and in other cases where pseudo-random sampling is\ndesired. The general principles behind Verus lotteries are the same, regardless of whether\nsomething similar to Algorand [29] for guaranteed selection or an original Verus algorithm\nbased on difficulty, such as Verus PoS is used for selection. Lotteries use the blockchain as a\nrandom oracle and are based on the assumption that the exact value of a specific block hash\nfrom a past block in the chain cannot be modified by a byzantine participant to weigh the\nodds in their favor.\n3.4.1\n\nParticipating in a Lottery\n\nSince the Verus network is completely decentralized, all lotteries, including PoS, are potential,\nand there is no central server selecting and sending messages to those who qualified in a\nlottery. When lotteries are implemented as a general feature, if you would like to participate\nin any Verus lottery or poll that is distributing tickets via lottery, you must first determine\nthat you qualify for the poll\u2019s requirements. You will then need to submit a transaction that\nproves that you have a valid claim and spend the output transaction of the lottery ticket to\nyour address using that proof. By default, that spend will authorize you to be a validator\non the autochain for the poll you are participating in, by providing you with the currency\nof that poll. You may validate the poll by leaving your wallet running, getting potential\nrewards in Verus or Virtue for both activities.\nLotteries will be useful for selecting subpopulations based on identity and claims people\nmake about themselves or that others claim about them, which they are willing to share.\nWhile detailed discussion of Verus identity is beyond the scope of this paper\u2019s release, the\nVerus system will provide self-sovereign identity with the ability for identities to make very\nflexible claims and have them attested to by other identities. For example, a lottery may look\nfor males between the ages of 18 to 25 among identities willing to share that information,\nwhich will even be possible to verify as strongly as through a validated passport or driver\u2019s\nlicense. Other polls may not require the same evidence backing claims. Polls may also have\nrestricted voting, such as local political polls, where verification and authorization for the\npoll must be provided explicitly, often by mail to a physical address or in person in the form\nof a QR code or electronically delivered transaction to your Verus wallet.\n\n16\n\n\f3.4.2\n\nProof of Stake Lottery\n\nA block validation lottery is a somewhat different form of lottery which allows you to claim\nthe right to validate a block and its associated reward based on proof-of-stake (for autochains)\nor 50/50 PoW/PoS (for the main chain). The lottery requires that a prior block hash 100\nblocks past combined with a qualifying UTXO of the destination public key hashed with the\nstaking block height and then divided by the UTXO value must be under the current proof\nof stake validation difficulty. By dividing by the UTXO value, Verus weights proof-of-stake\nor proof-of-virtue in proportion to the amount of stake or virtue in the UTXO. If no one who\nqualifies to validate a block is online or no one responds with a submitted block validation\nin a certain amount of time, the blockchain will wait until someone mines a block using\nproof-of-work.\n3.4.3\n\nTicket Harvesting Lotteries\n\nThere will be multiple ways to acquire tickets to participate in any particular poll. The\nmanual ways emphasized so far may include receiving a poll with QR code in post or email\nor perhaps directly from someone taking a poll. In addition to these direct ways to receive a\nvoting ticket, Verus will enable polls to be posted on the poll blockchain as transactions, the\ntickets for which are distributed from its outputs by lottery. This will work when the Verus\nID functionality is available, and will enable polls to require presence of specific claims or\nattestations on an ID, as well as the number of participants to select in the poll by creating\none transaction output for each, which is spendable by a cryptocondition [17] that defines\nthe lottery conditions and random difficulty. The difficulty determines how often a particular\nblock will match any attempt to harvest a ticket from that block.\n\n3.5\n\nMachine Learning Integration\n\nVerus enables humans to share and expose human knowledge through voting mechanisms to\nmake decisions, express opinions, and classify accurately. The data used for that classification, as well as the classifications or decisions themselves provide an ideal source of training\ndata for machine learning systems across any domain of human knowledge or opinion. As\ncorporations gather, sequester, and learn from massive amounts of personal data in order to\ncompete and boost their bottom line, rather than accrue to society\u2019s benefit, these massive\nprivate databases serve to affect and influence human populations by knowing more about\nthem than others, or even than they know about themselves.\nSince Verus enables humans to use voting mechanisms to classify and make decisions,\nand stores the results of this process in IPFS and on the blockchain, we will train machine\nlearning algorithms on these results over time, allowing them to eventually classify and make\ndecisions consistent with human decisions and values at an even higher scale. This will enable\nVerus to perform certain tasks automatically, such as the recognition of false or incorrect\nidentification data among participants in the system, the initial classification or rating of\ncertain content that can be overruled, but may not be appropriate for all audiences, and much\nmore. The end result of this is a more secure and trustworthy network, built on consensus\nand trustless principles, leveraging worldwide human knowledge as a base of information and\nmachines for scale.\n17\n\n\fA major Verus advantage over almost any other system in its use of Machine learning on\nhuman data is the innate privacy it provides to those whose data is used for learning, along\nwith the default that all resulting information be made public, unless those making polls pay\nthe Verus community a going rate to keep the data for themselves. In today\u2019s society, the\ngoal of most machine learning systems is to match consumers with products they are likely to\nbuy and/or manipulate them into an actual purchase, thus generating revenue. This creates\na situation that can create unintended negative consequences when algorithms disregard any\npositive or negative effects its predictive abilities may have on society [23]. For example, if\nthe algorithm recognizes that people with depressive episodes are more likely to gamble, and\nthus buy airline tickets to gambling-oriented locations, such as Las Vegas, it will advertise\nthose airline tickets to those people. In the Verus system, machine learning algorithms will\nbe able to learn from human beings, while being limited to accessing only the data users\npermit, and at the same time, being unable to easily target any specific individual.\n\n3.6\n\nVerus Mobile Polls\n\n18\n\n\fIn addition to a desktop wallet that supports Verus and other Komodo platforms or compatible applications, mobile support is a high priority and will provide yet another layer of\nconvenience for users, enabling them to use, earn, and spend Verus in everyday life. We intend to provide a Verus mobile experience that functions as a wallet, self-sovereign identity,\nprovides easy access to the polling and earning applications, and is intended to server as an\nextensible application browser, capable of supporting additional applications that leverage\nthe Komodo or compatible ecosystems. While we have already begun thinking about and\nstoryboarding design and development of user experiences, we do not expect any mobile\nexperience to be ready until completion of Phase II at the earliest. Even when the first\nmobile experiences are ready, they will not include the support for private transactions that\nwe intend to enable as a foundation for confidential, mobile polling and communications. To\nget a feel for the way we envision Verus experiences working in practice, below is an example\nof some poll screens from early designs.\n\n4\n\nImplementation and Roadmap\n\nAfter researching options from building the technology ourselves to leveraging unreleased\nadvanced projects, to using one of the few well thought through blockchain application\nplatforms, we decided to start building the Verus project as a friendly fork of Komodo and\nits asset chain technology, enabling us to both become a contributing member of and also\nenhance and extend the Komodo platform as Verus builds blockchain platform technologies\nand real world applications of PBaaS.\nBy leveraging proven zk-SNARK zero knowledge privacy technologies and Komodo\u2019s\ndelayed proof of work (dPoW), which notarizes the main Verus blockchain into Komodo\u2019s\nblockchain, which is then notarized into the Bitcoin blockchain, we underpin Verus with a\nfoundation of state-of-the-art privacy, security, and interledger transaction capabilities as\nour baseline. Above that, we have already developed advanced features that further enhance\nsecurity, improve decentralization, and prepare for the implementation of autochains and\nproof of virtue.\nWe will maintain our own open source fork of the Komodo platform and collaborate with\nthe Komodo team when possible to develop new features or capabilities that can be accessed\ncross-chain by projects across the Komodo platform and even other blockchains that are\nsimply compatible with Komodo\u2019s Interledger Protocol implementations. We will maintain\nour development as an open source project and contribute back to the broader open source\ncommunity, as we leverage the contributions of others that have made it possible for us to\nbegin realizing our vision as a community.\nAll that said, roadmaps are never perfect. Unless we significantly underpromise and\nprioritize a date so highly that no feature or capability is important in and of itself, targeting\ntimeframes and milestones without specific target dates allows us to be ambitious in our goals\nand adapt to a changing world as we deliver. Even in Phase I, which we have delivered as\nof the writing of this paper, we adjusted our plan, and in an uncharacteristic turn of events,\ndelivered even more than we had originally planned. We do not expect that to always\nbe the case, and we will focus more on correct and complete phases than specific dates\nwhen possible. Sometimes, as with any major endeavor, the right choice is to recognize an\n19\n\n\funexpected opportunity or obstacle, take two steps to the right or left, and only then proceed\nforward.\nFor the purpose of this whitepaper, we will discuss four phases of the Verus vision. We do\nnot see these four phases as a completion of the vision as much as four phases of an ongoing\nmission to advance Verus and its contribution to society that we can currently express. From\nits inception and throughout the project, the Verus chain will serve as our fungible value\nchain, and use of Verus tokens on this chain will be the core value around which we continue\nto develop the Verus vision.\nThe first Verus chain, which is already available at the time of this white paper\u2019s release,\nincludes zk-SNARKs for privacy, both transparent and private addresses, a brand new CPUmineable hash algorithm for proof of work, a brand new proof of stake algorithm, and a\nunique emission schedule among fair launch cryptocurrency projects. Each phase of our\nproject\u2019s development will introduce capabilities and experiences that provide independent\nvalue on their own, further leverage Verus Coin to power operation, and create a foundation\nupon which to build the next phase.\n\nWe intend and hope for the Verus project to become a worldwide, inclusive community\neffort, which welcomes and rewards those who contribute. Although we articulate these first\nfour phases here, we see these phases as just the beginning, and we hope you will join us by\nparticipating in and contributing to the Verus project to make our world a better place.\n20\n\n\f4.1\n\nPhase I \u2013 Mainnet \u2013 50/50 PoW/PoS \u2013 Time Locks \u2013 Fair\nLaunch\n\nIn phase one, the Verus main network began with a slow start and 15 minutes advance notice\nat 7:15am GMT, Monday, May 21st, 2018.\nThe Verus network began emitting first 0 block reward, rising linearly each block over\nthe course of 7 days until block 10080 to its peak of 384 coins per block. The Verus emission\nschedule is as follows:\nEra 1:\nBlock 0 - 10080 reward: 0 to 384, rising linearly and changing each block\nEra 2:\nBlock 10080 - 53279 reward: 384\nBlock 53280 - 96479 reward: 192\nBlock 96480 - 139679 reward: 96\nBlock 139680 - 182879 reward: 48\nBlock 182880 - 226079 reward: 24\nEra 3:\nBlock 226080 - 1277279 reward: 24\nBlock 1277280 - 2328479 reward: 12\nBlock 2328480 - 3379679 reward: 6\n. . . halving indefinitely every 1051200 blocks (approximately 2 years)\nWe also added another fair twist on the launch that we believe will contribute to a more\nstable value growth in the Verus currency, without any unusual risk of dumping by any single\nparty. During the first 5 months, Verus will have an accelerated reward curve for mining\nand staking, with a halving every month. During the first two months, when the block\nrewards are at or above 192 Verus, mined blocks will have time locked coinbase transactions,\npreventing spending, staking, or transferring of those coins for a period that varies from\napproximately 3 months after the genesis block, based on numbers of blocks, to 2 years and\n3 months. These time locked coins provide a smooth release of the Verus currency supply as\nwell as incentive to all of their owners to support the long term success of the Verus network\nand project.\nFrom the very beginning of its operation, Verus operated with a dual proof of stake /\nproof of work mechanism for all participants. Verus mining with the VerusHash algorithm,\nas of this point, is a CPU-only algorithm, designed with a Haraka512 V2 [30] core to be\nquantum secure and to maximize performance on modern CPUs. While VerusHash was\ndesigned to be CPU-optimized and did not begin life with GPU or ASIC miners capable of\nbeating CPUs in its mining, the Verus developers have no illusions that it is possible someone\nmight develop either a GPU or ASIC-based miner that could be meaningfully superior to\nCPUs.\n\n21\n\n\fTo ensure that such a solution if developed, remains open, jl777, lead developer of the\nKomodo Platform, has offered a 1 Bitcoin bounty to any developer who can make and\npublish in an open manner, a GPU miner for the VerusHash algorithm that can significantly\noutperform the current CPU miner. In order to win the bounty, the source code for the\nminer must be available under open source licensing. To be eligible for the bounty, any\nimplementation must be able to perform 5x better than a modern, high thread-count, high\nclock-rate CPU on a GPU costing under $1000. By bringing up the Verus network this way,\nwe established an immediate, baseline set of functionality, above which we can build out\nour project and community around a functional coin and project, as we stay in sync with\nadvancements in the underlying Komodo platform.\nVerus phase one release was pre-announced on Bitcointalk [28] with zero premine, and\nteam members mined and staked along with everyone else to generate coins. In addition to\ncoins mined by individual team members for their own benefit, the Verus developers intend\nto donate most of their mined and staked earnings to a community Verus foundation along\nwith other donating community members who will join us, in order to support the ongoing\ngrowth and project development by core developers and the community for years to come.\n\n4.2\n\nPhase Two \u2013 Autochains, Polls, Verus Mobile\n\nAs soon as we completed phase one, we entered phase two, which includes release of this\nwhite paper, activation of the community through donations of some of our mined coins,\nand a push to finish planning for, development and release of mobile support, autochain\ncapability, and the ability to setup, and then easily run CVT polls at scale.\n\n4.3\n\nPhase Three \u2013 Identity, and Proof of Virtue\n\nIn phase three, we plan to further improve the mobile experiences, implement the identity system, including support for strong, decentralized identity and attestations, separating\nphoto IDs and other photo content into components that can be separately verified in unbiased human polls. At this point, we intend to support optional KYC strong identities, via\nboth notarization of identities as well as poll-based identity verification. This will also be\nthe first phase that supports Verus chain validation PoV enhanced PoS.\n\n4.4\n\nPhase Four \u2013 Integrated Machine Learning, Content, Storage\n\nIn phase four, Verus will begin to truly leverage the foundation built in phases one, two, and\nthree by focusing on broad content classification capabilities for off-chain content, improving storage management support in its distributed hash table implementations, supporting\nstorage monetization in some way, and providing open source, public implementations of\nmachine learning systems that can learn from data on the Verus network to solve real world\nchallenges of today and tomorrow.\n\n22\n\n\f5\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nThis paper includes predictions, statements of intent, discussion of plans, estimates or other\ninformation that might be considered forward-looking. While these forward-looking statements represent our judgment and expectation of what the future holds, this is not an offer\nor solicitation to purchase any product, good, service, or security. All statements herein\nare subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results of the Verus Project\u2019s\ndevelopment to differ materially. Furthermore, we intend to use the Verus blockchain as\nour open source development platform \u2013 contributing these technologies under permissive\nlicensing for the betterment of society, not focusing solely on profit of anyone affiliated with\nthe Verus project. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance, especially in any financial\ndecision, on these forward-looking statements, which are subject to modification, update, or\nchange for legitimate reasons both within or beyond our control. By expressing our vision\nand goals, the Verus Core developers are not obligating ourselves to revise or publicly release\nthe results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information\nor future events.\n\n23\n\n\fReferences\n[1] S.
