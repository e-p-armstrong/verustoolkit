            "Proof of Virtue (PoV) is a concept introduced by Verus to enhance its PoS (Proof of Stake) algorithm. PoV is inspired by the EigenTrust algorithm and aims to weight staking contests with both Verus stake and \"Virtue\", a special trust rating of identities within the network.\n\nIn the Verus Network, Virtue is a rare and valued property that drives correct behavior. It is not purchasable or saleable, but Verus holders can earn a small measure of Virtue by participating in activities that benefit the network, such as staking, attesting to facts, validating information, or providing other measurable benefits.\n\nThe Virtue system is designed to incentivize good behavior and reward contributors to the network. Over time, addresses can improve their earnings by increasing their Virtue weighting, which is based on their recorded activity and behavior.\n\nVirtue has intrinsic value on the Verus network, and there will be methods for transferring it through wallet ownership, such as in cases of probate or other necessity. However, using Virtue as a tool for trading will not provide a secure or intended method of increasing one's stake.\n\nThe ultimate goal of PoV is to create a more secure and trustworthy network, where participants are incentivized to act in the best interests of the community. By incorporating Virtue into the PoS algorithm, Verus aims to create a more robust and reliable system that rewards good behavior and promotes a positive ecosystem.",
            "Using a model similar to the EigenTrust algorithm, Verus will introduce the idea of Proof of\nVirtue (PoV) enhancement to the PoS algorithm initially released in Phase I. In PoV, we\nintend to weight staking contests with both Verus stake and \u201cVirtue\u201d, a special \u201ccurrency\u201d,\nexpected to be tracked on a Virtue autochain, and used as a trust rating of identities within\nthe network.\nIn a similar way to the \u201camount of stake\u201d used when staking, Virtue will add another\ncomponent to the probability of being selected to process a block of transactions on the\nVerus Network. Its probabilities upon introduction will not change returns on the Verus PoS\nsystem, but addresses will gradually be able to improve earnings with a Virtue weighting \u2013\nbased on recorded activity and behavior.\nIn order to ensure that Virtue is both a rare and valued property, which drives correct\nbehavior, it will neither be purchased, nor sold. Verus holders will have opportunities to\nearn a small measure of Virtue, which can then be further increased by staking the Virtue\nitself, when attesting to a fact for the network, validating information, or providing another\nmeasurable benefit to the network.\nSince Virtue will have intrinsic value on the Verus network, there will be methods for\ntransferring it through wallet ownership \u2013 for cases of probate or other necessity \u2013 but such\nbehavior as a tool for trading in virtue will not provide a secure or intended method of\n11",
