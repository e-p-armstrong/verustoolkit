            "How does Verus plan to handle the potential for negative content on its network, and what is its vision for content classification and rating?",
            "Verus is designed to be a censorship-free system, which means that it will inevitably allow for a range of content, including potentially harmful or negative content. To address this, Verus plans to utilize its built-in poll system to enable users to rate and classify content on the network. This will allow users to earn rewards for participating in polls and will also enable the selective filtering of content based on value judgments and classification.\n\nThe initial focus of this content classification system will be on relatively simple tasks, such as identifying toxic comments, hate speech, or categorizing information. However, Verus's long-term vision is to develop a system that enables people to classify content more accurately than machine learning algorithms, while also being able to be followed and generalized by these algorithms at scale.\n\nThe goal of this system is to provide a way for users to earn rewards while also contributing to a safer and more positive experience for all participants on the network. By empowering users to classify and rate content, Verus aims to create a system that is more effective and accurate than traditional machine learning-based approaches.\n\nUltimately, Verus's vision is to create a system that can distinguish between truth and opinion, and to enable users to make informed decisions about the content they engage with. By leveraging the collective wisdom of its user base, Verus aims to create a more trustworthy and reliable platform for information sharing and collaboration.",
            "While Verus is designed to provide invaluable tools to people across the world, any system\nwithout censorship will also inevitably allow the underbelly of humanity to show through.\nThat means that while we would want all people to participate, we recognize that in order\nfor that to provide the most positive experience for all participants, we must use the Verus\npoll system itself to recognize, rate, and classify the content on its network, enabling those\nwho provide such a service through participation in polls to earn, while enabling the selective\nfiltering of content based on value judgements and classification of honest populations.\nWhile we recognize that the best early use case for such capability is in rating and\nclassifying non-intrinsic polls themselves, the ability to classify content is a fundamental\nstrength that Verus will increasingly develop over time. At first, we expect such classification\nto be applied to relatively simple tasks for humans, such as identifying toxic comments, hate\nspeech, or categories of information. Even though these types of classification systems have\nlargely employed machine learning systems running against privately curated training data,\nour vision is for Verus content classification to enable people to earn, as they classify content\nbetter than any machine learning system, but in a way that can be followed by the best\nmachine learning algorithms, and generalized at scale.\n3.3.8Truth vs. Opinion",
