            "What are the goals and vision of the Verus project in terms of improving the mobile experience, implementing a decentralized identity system, and integrating machine learning and content storage capabilities?",
            "The Verus project aims to create a robust and decentralized ecosystem with a strong focus on identity, content classification, storage management, and machine learning capabilities. \n\nIn terms of improving the mobile experience, Verus plans to enhance its mobile applications to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for its users. \n\nThe project envisions a decentralized identity system that supports strong, decentralized identity and attestations. This system will allow for optional KYC (Know Your Customer) strong identities, which can be verified through both notarization of identities and poll-based identity verification. This will provide users with a secure and trustworthy way to manage their identities and attestations.\n\nIn addition, Verus plans to integrate machine learning capabilities into its ecosystem to enable broad content classification capabilities for off-chain content. This will allow for more efficient and effective management of content on the Verus network. \n\nThe project also aims to improve its storage management support in its distributed hash table implementations, which will enable more efficient storage and retrieval of data on the network. Furthermore, Verus plans to support storage monetization, which will create new opportunities for users to earn revenue from their stored data.\n\nFinally, Verus envisions providing open-source, public implementations of machine learning systems that can learn from data on the Verus network to solve real-world challenges. This will enable the development of innovative solutions that can address some of the world's most pressing problems.\n\nOverall, the Verus project's goals and vision are centered around creating a decentralized, secure, and efficient ecosystem that empowers users to take control of their identities, content, and data.",
            "In phase three, we plan to further improve the mobile experiences, implement the identity system, including support for strong, decentralized identity and attestations, separating\nphoto IDs and other photo content into components that can be separately verified in unbiased human polls. At this point, we intend to support optional KYC strong identities, via\nboth notarization of identities as well as poll-based identity verification. This will also be\nthe first phase that supports Verus chain validation PoV enhanced PoS.4.4Phase Four \u2013 Integrated Machine Learning, Content, StorageIn phase four, Verus will begin to truly leverage the foundation built in phases one, two, and\nthree by focusing on broad content classification capabilities for off-chain content, improving storage management support in its distributed hash table implementations, supporting\nstorage monetization in some way, and providing open source, public implementations of\nmachine learning systems that can learn from data on the Verus network to solve real world\nchallenges of today and tomorrow.225Forward Looking Statements",
