            "How does Verus enable honest and verifiable answers to polls and questions while respecting the privacy of respondents, and what are the long-term goals and vision of the Verus Project?",
            "Verus enables honest and verifiable answers to polls and questions while respecting the privacy of respondents through its unique combination of privacy, polls at scale, and identity features. This is achieved by allowing users to post transactions and proofs to the Verus network, enabling results and coordination across applications or people. This means that Verus can be used to ask almost any question of a population or subpopulation of people, receive a verifiable answer, and still respect the privacy of the respondents.\n\nIn terms of its long-term goals and vision, the Verus Project aims to enable direct participation in the global economy for all individuals. Verus applications will allow anyone to speak up with the power of an authorized participant, while maintaining the confidence of anonymity. This will produce a verifiable, transparent, and honest flow of information globally. The ultimate goal is to transform the way anonymity functions in our current technological environment, prioritizing cooperation and providing financial incentives for that cooperation to occur.\n\nIn the future, Verus polls will be combined with machine learning to enable society to benefit directly from collective intelligence without risking individual privacy. This will have numerous applications, including determining the accuracy of news online, research, and political polling. Overall, the Verus Project envisions a world where individuals can participate in the global economy with confidence, transparency, and honesty, while maintaining control over their personal data and privacy.",
            "almost completely parallel and isolated from the main Verus chain, except for the capability\nof posting transactions and proofs to Verus, for results and coordination across applications\nor people.\nBy combining privacy, polls at scale, and identity, Verus can be used to post polls and\nask almost any question of a population or subpopulation of people, receive an honest \u2013 and,\nimportantly \u2013 verifiable answer, and still respect the privacy of the respondents. When even\nthe first support for polling is active on the Verus network, the Verus community will be\nable to vote on the long term direction of the Verus Project, itself.\nOver time, Verus polls \u2013 used for purposes such as determining the accuracy of news\nonline, for research, or even for political polling, will be combined with machine learning\nto enable all of us, as a society, to benefit directly from our collective intelligence without\ntoday\u2019s risks to our individual privacy. Verus will combine auditability and verifiability of\ntransactions with the option of verified, confidential participation \u2013 meaning societies and\norganizations can directly understand what people think, feel, and believe, as populations \u2013\nwithout taking control of their personal data or targeting some individuals, based on their\nanswers or beliefs.\nUltimately, our vision for the Verus Project is to enable us all to directly participate\nin our own worldwide economy. Verus applications will enable any individual to speak up\nwith the power of an authorized participant \u2013 and with the confidence of anonymity \u2013 to\nproduce a verifiable, transparent, and honest flow of information throughout the globe. It\nwill transform the way that anonymity functions in our current technological environment \u2013\nprioritizing cooperation and providing the financial incentive for that cooperation to occur.3Important Verus Concepts",
