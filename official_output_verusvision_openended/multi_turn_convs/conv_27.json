    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about Verus's plans for creating a platform for voting and election systems. Can you tell me more about how Verus plans to achieve scalability and security in its blockchain-based system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus aims to create a platform that enables a better society through blockchain technology, specifically by building voting and election systems on its blockchain-based system. To achieve this, Verus needs to add another dimension of information that retains privacy and is anchored to a primary store of value, which is Verus itself.\n\nOne approach to creating this additional dimension of meaning is through a system of \"coloring,\" which is used by some blockchain systems like Ethereum. However, this approach has been proven to be suboptimal, leading to congestion and high fees on the blockchain.\n\nInstead of adopting this approach, Verus takes a novel approach to scaling by using highly scalable PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) autochains. This approach provides an extra dimension of information and an unlimited number of token types or \"colors,\" while also rewarding Verus miners and node operators as provisioning agents.\n\nIn essence, Verus is not just a single blockchain, but a blockchain-based system that allows for the creation of multiple blockchains, each with its own application instance. This approach provides significant scale and security benefits through the isolation of transaction processing for each application instance on its own blockchain.\n\nVerus's vision is to create a system that enables secure, private, and scalable voting and election systems, and its approach to achieving this vision is through the use of PBaaS autochains, which provide a novel method of scaling that prioritizes security and scalability.\n\nDo you have any further questions about Verus's approach to creating a platform for voting and election systems, or how PBaaS autochains work?",

            "With Verus, we plan to create a platform upon which we will build voting and even election\nsystems that support our vision of enabling a better society through blockchain.\nTo run simultaneous polls across disparate populations on one blockchain-based system,\nwe need another dimension of information \u2013 one that retains privacy, and is anchored to a\nprimary store of value, Verus.\nOne approach to creating another dimension of meaning would be a system of \u201ccoloring.\u201d\nThe Ethereum blockchain system and some layers over Bitcoin or Bitcoin compatible coins\nuse a version of a coloring system.

While, at first glance, this seems like a\nreasonable approach, it is actually a suboptimal solution, at best.\nWith Ethereum and the ICO experiences of 2017 [9][10], we now know what happens when\nyou create one blockchain and overload it with transactions: Congestion and unnecessarily\nhigh fees. Developers have proposed many solutions to this problem of scaling \u2013 including\na move to proof-of-stake systems and sharding (effectively trying to separate the various7functions on a blockchain), or even a move to large systems of parallel chains with a common\ndesign.\nYet instead of implementing a \u201csolution\u201d with colored coins sharing one blockchain, we\nhave decided to take a completely new approach to this problem. Our approach will not\nonly provide an extra dimension of information and an unlimited number of token types,\nor \u201ccolors\u201d, but it will do so with highly scalable PBaaS autochains, which also reward\nVerus miners and node operators as provisioning agents. This is a novel method of scaling,\none which provides significant scale and security benefits through isolation of transaction\nprocessing for each application instance on its own blockchain.\nRather than thinking of Verus as a single blockchain, it is more appropriate\nto think of it as a blockchain-based system, one that is ",
