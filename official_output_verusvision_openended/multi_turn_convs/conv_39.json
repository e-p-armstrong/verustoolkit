    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about how machine learning is used on human data, and I'm a bit concerned about privacy. How does Verus protect user privacy when using machine learning on human data, and what are the benefits of this approach compared to traditional machine learning systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Verus provides an advantage over traditional machine learning systems by ensuring innate privacy for individuals whose data is used for learning. This is achieved through a system where users have control over the data they permit to be accessed. In contrast, traditional machine learning systems often prioritize revenue generation by matching consumers with products they are likely to buy, which can lead to unintended negative consequences.\n\nIn Verus, machine learning algorithms learn from human beings while being limited to accessing only the data users permit. This approach prevents the algorithms from easily targeting specific individuals, unlike traditional systems that can use predictive abilities to manipulate users. For example, in a traditional system, an algorithm might recognize that people with depressive episodes are more likely to gamble and thus target them with advertisements for airline tickets to gambling-oriented locations. In Verus, such targeted advertisements are not possible.\n\nMoreover, Verus's approach ensures that resulting information from machine learning is made public by default, unless those making polls pay the Verus community a going rate to keep the data for themselves. This approach promotes transparency and accountability, aligning with Verus's vision of creating a system that benefits society as a whole.\n\nOverall, Verus's approach to machine learning on human data prioritizes user privacy, transparency, and accountability, making it a more responsible and ethical alternative to traditional machine learning systems.\n\nDo you have any further questions about how Verus protects user privacy in machine learning, or would you like more information on the benefits of this approach?",

            "A major Verus advantage over almost any other system in its use of Machine learning on\nhuman data is the innate privacy it provides to those whose data is used for learning, along\nwith the default that all resulting information be made public, unless those making polls pay\nthe Verus community a going rate to keep the data for themselves. In today\u2019s society, the\ngoal of most machine learning systems is to match consumers with products they are likely to\nbuy and/or manipulate them into an actual purchase, thus generating revenue. This creates\na situation that can create unintended negative consequences when algorithms disregard any\npositive or negative effects its predictive abilities may have on society [23]. For example, if\nthe algorithm recognizes that people with depressive episodes are more likely to gamble, and\nthus buy airline tickets to gambling-oriented locations, such as Las Vegas, it will advertise\nthose airline tickets to those people. In the Verus system, machine learning algorithms will\nbe able to learn from human beings, while being limited to accessing only the data users\npermit, and at the same time, being unable to easily target any specific individual.3.6Verus Mobile Polls18",
