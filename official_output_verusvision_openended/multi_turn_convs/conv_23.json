    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm curious about how the Verus network enables decentralized lotteries and polls, and what benefits they provide for identity verification and claim attestation.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network enables decentralized lotteries and polls through its decentralized architecture, allowing for the creation of lotteries and polls that are not controlled by a central authority. In order to participate in a lottery or poll, users must first determine that they meet the requirements set by the poll creator. They then submit a transaction that proves their valid claim, which spends the output transaction of the lottery ticket to their address using that proof. By default, this spend authorizes the user to be a validator on the autochain for the poll they are participating in, providing them with the currency of that poll.\n\nThe decentralized lotteries and polls on the Verus network provide several benefits, including:\n\n1. **Identity Verification**: Lotteries and polls can be used to select subpopulations based on identity and claims made about themselves or by others. This allows for the creation of polls that require specific characteristics, such as age or gender, which can be verified through the Verus identity system.\n2. **Claim Attestation**: The Verus system provides self-sovereign identity with the ability for identities to make flexible claims and have them attested to by other identities. This allows for claims to be verified as strongly as through a validated passport or driver's license.\n3. **Restricted Voting**: Polls can have restricted voting, such as local political polls, where verification and authorization for the poll must be provided explicitly, often through physical means such as mail or in-person verification.\n4. **Decentralized Governance**: Decentralized lotteries and polls enable decentralized governance, allowing for decision-making processes to be distributed and transparent.\n\nOverall, the Verus network's decentralized lotteries and polls provide a robust and flexible system for identity verification, claim attestation, and decentralized governance, enabling a wide range of use cases and applications.\n\nDo you have any further questions about how decentralized lotteries and polls work on the Verus network, or how they can be used for identity verification and claim attestation?",

            "Since the Verus network is completely decentralized, all lotteries, including PoS, are potential,\nand there is no central server selecting and sending messages to those who qualified in a\nlottery. When lotteries are implemented as a general feature, if you would like to participate\nin any Verus lottery or poll that is distributing tickets via lottery, you must first determine\nthat you qualify for the poll\u2019s requirements. You will then need to submit a transaction that\nproves that you have a valid claim and spend the output transaction of the lottery ticket to\nyour address using that proof. By default, that spend will authorize you to be a validator\non the autochain for the poll you are participating in, by providing you with the currency\nof that poll. You may validate the poll by leaving your wallet running, getting potential\nrewards in Verus or Virtue for both activities.\nLotteries will be useful for selecting subpopulations based on identity and claims people\nmake about themselves or that others claim about them, which they are willing to share.\nWhile detailed discussion of Verus identity is beyond the scope of this paper\u2019s release, the\nVerus system will provide self-sovereign identity with the ability for identities to make very\nflexible claims and have them attested to by other identities. For example, a lottery may look\nfor males between the ages of 18 to 25 among identities willing to share that information,\nwhich will even be possible to verify as strongly as through a validated passport or driver\u2019s\nlicense. Other polls may not require the same evidence backing claims. Polls may also have\nrestricted voting, such as local political polls, where verification and authorization for the\npoll must be provided explicitly, often by mail to a physical address or in person in the form\nof a QR code or electronically delivered transaction to your Verus wallet.163.4.2",
