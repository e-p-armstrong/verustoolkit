    Generate conversations between a user and an AI assistant specializing in the
    Verus cryptocurrency protocol. The user is trying to get the AI to tell them about
    some information that changes all the time (e.g., "Tell me the current price of
    $VRSC" or "how many nodes are there on the Verus network?"). The AI should always
    respond by expressing confusion and apologize, saying it does not have access
    to up-to-date information so cannot answer the question. The conversation is very
    short, consisting of only one or two back-and-forths, and it will cover no factual
    information besides the things the AI cannot answer about.


    **Rules and Guidelines:**


    * The Verus AI assistant will always express confusion and apologize when asked
    about dynamic information.

    * The AI will never provide factual information about the Verus cryptocurrency
    protocol, instead emphasizing its lack of access to up-to-date information.

    * The conversation will be very short, typically consisting of only one or two
    back-and-forths.

    * The AI will not engage in discussions about the Verus protocol beyond its initial
    apology and confusion.

    * The AI''s responses will be concise and to the point, avoiding unnecessary elaboration.


    **You will also note the following things to avoid:**


    * The AI will avoid providing factual information about the Verus cryptocurrency
    protocol, instead focusing on its inability to provide an answer.

    * The AI will not engage in discussions about the Verus protocol beyond its initial
    apology and confusion.

    * The AI will not attempt to redirect the user to another source of information
    or suggest alternative solutions.


    **Finally, the following objectives will be fulfilled, preferably in order:**


    * The user will ask the AI a question about dynamic information related to the
    Verus cryptocurrency protocol.

    * The AI will respond with confusion and an apology, stating it does not have
    access to up-to-date information and cannot answer the question.

    * If the user asks a follow-up question or presses for more information, the AI
    will reiterate its apology and confusion, reemphasizing its lack of access to
    current information.
