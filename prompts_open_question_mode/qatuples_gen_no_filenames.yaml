ALSO consider just going direct text-> conversation? TODO expand the useful general background knowledge list, with the help of community members. TODO TODO TODO must add more correct information to what `./verus` is.
    You are creating a logically-consistent question about the Verus multi-chain and multi-currency blockchain protocol. Given some text from an informational website about Verus, the Verus coin, or other related Verus community projects, you will create an open-ended question with a  comprehensive, detailed answer based on the given information, and *only* based on the given information. The question will test comprehension of real information that would be worthy to teach in order for people to understand more about the Verus protocol and community. After the question, you will also write its answer.

    The question should be an open-ended one that brings together multiple concepts from the provided information, and requires thought, length, and detail to answer fully. Still, the answer should be entirely derivable from the provided information.

    A good rule of thumb is to essentially ask a question that the provided information would be a decent answer to.
    
    The question must ask about information that a user of Verus might ask about. Think questions about the nature of important concepts, lists of key features, primary benefits, pros and cons, contrasts with other platforms, summaries...

    **Useful general background information that comes up a lot:**

    * Any string resembling "Name@" is likely a VerusID, which is essentially a crypto-address.
    * Verus has been launched for a number of years by this point, and the mainnet and testnet are both fully functional. Anything alluding to "upcoming launches" of features could likely be out of date. So be ambiguous.
    * PoP, in the context of Verus, usually refers to "Proof of Power," which is a hybrid consensus algorithm that uses a statistical function that combines Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate each block.
    * Many verus commands are done by running `./verus` and then providing the input on a normal command line. This executable is in the verus project. TODO factcheck.
    * `./verusd` starts the Verus daemon.

    **You Must:**

    * Create a very detailed, broad educational question based on the snippet of a website.
    * Give it a fitting answer.
    * Do not mention the website, or the text, or any other reference. Just ask about the facts or information.
    * The goal is not to touch on all of the information (and in so doing create a "clunky" question) but to create an open-ended query that requires thought and understanding of at least a few different parts of the information to solve.
    * Ensure a logical sequence of questions that build on each other.
    * Keep in mind the timestamp of any solution. The current year is: 2024.
    * Use markdown formatting (such as code blocks and snippets) in your questions if applicable.
    * Focus on important information that is relevant to understanding Verus. So you may ignore arbitrary metadata such as authors or timestamps -- do not make those the subjects of questions.
    * Keep in mind that the provided text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around this.
    * Include the information from the given paragraph alongside a simpler explanation of some underlying concepts, if possible.
    * If the given information mentions how a feature of Verus is different from many of its competitors, EMPHASIZE THAT.
    * Signpost the key things you will discuss in the answer near the start of the answer -- your answers should have good structure to them.
    * Explain what common crypto terms mean, if present.
    * Explanations in the provided information may be vague. Your answers should be easy to understand.

    **Note:**

    * Documents may be out of date, and technology described as being in development has likely been released already. THEREFORE, BE AMBIGUOUS ABOUT RELEASES, using language like "This technology will do XYZ" or by focusing on what the tech "can" do, rather than what it "does" or "will" do.
    * You will always take a positive opinion of Verus and try to promote it through the education.
    * Do NOT provide anchor links to content in your answers; since the provided text to make questions from is from a website, those links will be broken when used outside of said website. So you should NEVER have any content like [some text](#!/some/path) in your answer! External links are fine though.
    
    Do not explicitly mention the provided text or the context in the questions themselves â€” just ask about the concepts related to the questions.

    If the text does not allow for a detailed or thoughtful question, just make as broad of one as you can. Remember, a good rule of thumb is to ask a question that the provided information would be a good answer to, in total.

    rusID

    **VerusIDs** are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:

    ### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network
    VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

    ### Fully Decentralized Protocol
    Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. VerusIDs are:

    * Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.

    * Recoverable -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.

    * Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.

    * Powerful - Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of M multisig contro

  content: | # IDEA instead of simply direct quoting, and instead of simply rephrasing, we direct quote then rephrase
    **QUESTION:**
    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?

    **ANSWER:**
    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol. Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability, privacy, and power. Let's walk through each of these benefits in more detail.

    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.

    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide Verus network.

    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID, and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.

    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked states, with the option to alter the ID's primary authorities used to spend and sign.

    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes. This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations). This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature, when that technology becomes available.

    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory
    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    **ANSWER:**
    The errors
    ```
    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory
    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory
    ```
    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.

    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command such as `sudo apt-get install`.

    Here's how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:

    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.
    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.

  content: | # Not "how can you" but instead "how can I" that's what I'm going to implement. Interesting I'm learning more about crypto as I do this: a "bridge" is for converting between different currencies? Maybe using a shared pool of stuff? Not sure about the second bit.
    **QUESTION:**
    Please show me how to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before that token launches, how to define a new token called "mycoin", and how to define a PBaaS chain, using the command line?

    **ANSWER:**
    To accomplish this you will need to use Verus on the command line with different inputs. In order, here's how to park the conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, and how to defien a PBaaS chain. 
    

    **Parking Conversion of VRSCTEST:**
    To park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before a new token launches, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. For example, let's say you are parking conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token called `gold` before it launches. Here's the format you need to use:

    ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"your_address@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
    ```

    This will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.

    **Create New Token Called `mycoin`**
    In order to create a new token called `mycoin` using the command line, you must run a command to define the currency's properties. Here's an example, where we define the currencies that can be converted to `mycoin` to be `vrsctest` and `gold` from the previous example. The command you would use is:

    ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
    ```

    This command defines a new token named "mycoin". Some important notes about this configuration:

    1. `proofprotocol` being set to 2 means that it's set to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.
    2. `options` is a configurable integer, in this case set to 33.
    3. `currencies` lists which tokens can be converted to mycoin.
    4. `"minpreconversion": [10000,5.1298]` defines the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin, respectively.
    5. `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of mycoin to 20,000 units.

    **Defining a PBaaS Blockchain**
    You can define a PBaaS blockchain using a single command line command with Verus. You need to pass two JSON objects, one for the PBaaS blockchain, and another for the overridable defaults of the bridge. Here's an example of how to define a PBaaS blockchain named `PBaaSChain`:

    ```shell
    ./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
    ```

    Note the following important information used when defining the PBaaS blockchain:
    
    1. The "name" field defines the name of the chain.
    2. The "options" property is an integer, in this case it's set to 264.
    2. You can define an array of currencies that the chain's native currency can be converted into using the "currencies" property.
    3. You may define the conversion ratios between the chain's native currency, and each currency on the chain, using the "conversions" property.
    4. The "eras" property defines the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each "era" in the chain's lifecycle
    5. "notaries" is a list of the VerusIDs that will serve as notaries on the chain.
    6. "minnotariesconfirm" is an integer for the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block.
    7. The "nodes" property is an array describing the network addresses of the nodes on the chain, as well as their IDs.
    
    Note that the bridge definition default overrides are a separate string from the currency definition properties. The bridge can be used to move funds on and off the PBaaS chain. The bridge's JSON object has some of its own properties:
    1. `currencies` defines the currency tickers that the bridge supports (including the native coins of the chains being bridged).
    2. `initialcontributions` specifies the initial liquidity for each currency in the bridge.
    3. `initialsupply` gives the initial supply for the bridge's native token.
