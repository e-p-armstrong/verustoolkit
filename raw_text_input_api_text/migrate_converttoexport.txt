migrate_converttoexport rawTx dest_symbol export_amount

Convert a raw transaction to a cross-chain export.
If neccesary, the transaction should be funded using fundrawtransaction.
Finally, the transaction should be signed using signrawtransaction
The finished export transaction, plus the payouts, should be passed to the "migrate_createimporttransaction" method on a KMD node to get the corresponding import transaction.
