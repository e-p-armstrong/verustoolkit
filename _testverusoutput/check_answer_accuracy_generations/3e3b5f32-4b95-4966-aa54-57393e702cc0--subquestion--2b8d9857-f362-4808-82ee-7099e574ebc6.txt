One of the most significant innovations was the advent of steam power, which drastically reduced production costs.

It involves understanding the nature, sources, and limitations of knowledge. A key concept in epistemology is the idea of \"justified true belief,\" which suggests that for someone to know something, they must believe it to be true, have justification for this belief, and the belief must indeed be true. For example, believing that it will rain tomorrow because the weather forecast says so, and it turns out to be true, is a justified true belief.

It uses a set of symbols and rules to create a language that can precisely express ideas. One key aspect of formal logic is the concept of a valid argument, which is an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. For instance, in the statement 'All humans are mortal; Socrates is a human; therefore, Socrates is mortal,' the conclusion follows logically from the premises.
