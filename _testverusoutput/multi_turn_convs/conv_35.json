    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\\nAI Assistant: Hello there! I'm here to help you out with any questions or concerns you might have. How can I assist you today?\\nUser: I'm having a bit of trouble with my Verus Desktop wallet. How do you import multiple WIFs in one batch for private addresses in Verus Desktop?\\nAI Assistant: Not a problem! To import multiple WIFs in one batch for private addresses in Verus Desktop, go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner and enter the specific command for every WIF except for the final one, and then import the final WIF with a different command that triggers the chain to rescan all addresses in your wallet. Do you need me to break that down further for you?\\nUser: Yes, please. Also, what is the command to import a single WIF for a private address in the Verus Desktop GUI wallet?\\nAI Assistant: The command to import a single WIF for a private address in the Verus Desktop GUI wallet is: `run z_importkey \\\\\"<wif>\\\\\" \\\\\"yes\\\\\" 1`. Replace `<wif>` with the actual WIF you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier. Note: Don't use the WIF from the example above, but use the one from the CLI-interface in Verus Desktop. Let me know if you need any more assistance with this.\\nUser: Thanks for that! One last question, what should you do before importing a single WIF for a private address in Verus Desktop?\\nAI Assistant: No problem! Before importing a single WIF for a private address in Verus Desktop, go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner and ensure you have the actual **wif** you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier. I hope that helps, please feel free to ask anymore questions.",
