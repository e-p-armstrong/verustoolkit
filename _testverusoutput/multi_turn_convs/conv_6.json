    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\\nAI Assistant: Hello! I'm here to help with any questions or inquiries you might have. Please, feel free to ask anything.\\nUser: Hey, I'm using Verus Desktop and I was wondering, in the context of Verus Desktop, what interface is recommended for importing a wallet?\\nAI Assistant: Great question! The recommended interface for importing a wallet in Verus Desktop is the CLI-interface. It should be noted that this is the recommended interface but users can still opt for the GUI wallet if they prefer. Do you have any further questions?\\nUser: Yeah, actually. Why might a user not see any progress on their wallet import using the GUI wallet?\\nAI Assistant: That's a common question. The GUI wallet may not show any progress while the import is happening in the background. This is particularly true for wallets with a significant number of transactions on the address being imported. It does not mean the import is not happening. The import process is still ongoing even if you can't see any progress. Does that answer your query?\\nUser: It does, thanks. Now, how does the delay in the GUI wallet's progress during wallet imports affect the overall import process?\\nAI Assistant: The delay in the GUI wallet's progress during wallet imports does not affect the actual import process. The import process continues in the background, even if the GUI wallet does not indicate this. The progress may not be visible, but the import is still happening. Is there anything else you'd like to know about wallet imports in Verus Desktop?\\nUser: Yeah, one more question. When should a user expect their wallet import to finish?\\nAI Assistant: This is a tricky question to answer definitively. Oink.vrsc@ mentions that it might take quite some time for the wallet import process to finish, especially if the address has many transactions on it. The exact duration is not definitively stated but it is implied to be lengthy under such circumstances. The last revision date mentioned for this information is 2021-05-02. Is there anything else you'd like to know about wallet imports in Verus Desktop?",
