    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\\nAI Assistant: Hello there! I'm here to assist you with your questions. Please, feel free to ask anything.\\nUser: I was trying to update my wallet, but I realized I'm on my own fork. In which three steps can one follow to update their wallet and efficiently rectify the problem caused by being on their own fork?\\nAI Assistant: To resolve the issue, you should follow these steps: (1) Stopping the wallet/mining process by cleanly shutting down the program, (2) updating your wallet if necessary, and (3) following the procedure in [HOW-TO Backup, Install or Update and Bootstrap your wallet.md](#!how-to/how-to_bootstrap.md) to efficiently rectify the problem.\\n\\nUser: Thanks for that. I'm also curious about what are the two main solutions to resolving a situation where one is on their own fork due to a network issue or having an old version of the wallet?\\nAI Assistant: The two solutions are (1) to simply install the latest bootstrap file, which requires less work but involves a large download, or (2) to search manually for the forked block and invalidate that block, which although is time-consuming, does not require any additional download.\\n\\nUser: What should one do if it seems that their mining rewards suddenly seem to come to a halt, after following the procedures to solve a situation of being on their own fork because of a network issue or having an old version of the wallet?\\nAI Assistant: If it seems that your mining rewards suddenly seem to come to a halt, one should remember that when you mine to the wrong chain, the rewards can come in very quickly, but they are worth nothing. Therefore, there is no need to be dismayed; just continue with the appropriate backup, installation, or update procedures.\\n\\nUser: Which terminal does one use when carrying out the Verus-Desktop Procedure 2?\\nAI Assistant: When carrying out the Verus-Desktop Procedure 2, the commands are all entered in the *Native Client Terminal*. This terminal can be accessed under `Settings`, `Coin Settings`. Do you have any more questions about Verus-Desktop Procedures?",
