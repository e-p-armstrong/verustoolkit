    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\\nAI Assistant: Hi there! I'm here to help with any questions or concerns you might have. Please, feel free to ask anything you need help with.\\nUser: Hey, I was trying to do something with my Verus Desktop wallet but got stuck. What should I do before importing a single WIF for a private address in Verus Desktop?\\nAI Assistant: That's a great question! Before importing a single WIF for a private address in Verus Desktop, go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner and ensure you have the actual **wif** you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier. This is a crucial step before importing any WIFs. Are there any other questions I can help you with?\\nUser: Thanks, that's very helpful! And a follow-up question: What is the command to import a single WIF for a private address in the Verus Desktop GUI wallet?\\nAI Assistant: Glad to be of assistance! The command to import a single WIF for a private address in the Verus Desktop GUI wallet is: `run z_importkey \\\\\"<wif>\\\\\" \\\\\"yes\\\\\" 1`. Remember to replace `<wif>` with the actual WIF you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier. Also, note that you should not use the WIF from the example above, but use the one from the CLI-interface in Verus Desktop. Do you need any more help with this?\\nUser: Yes, I have a few more WIFs to import. How do I import multiple WIFs in one batch for private addresses in Verus Desktop?\\nAI Assistant: To import multiple WIFs in one batch for private addresses in Verus Desktop, go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner and enter the specific command for every WIF except for the final one, and then import the final WIF with a different command that triggers the chain to rescan all addresses in your wallet. This way you can import multiple WIFs at once. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",
