    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\\nAI Assistant: Hi there! I'm here to assist with any questions you might have about the Verus Desktop wallet. Don't hesitate to ask.\\nUser: What does the command `run importprivkey \\\\\"<wif>\\\\\" \\\\\"\\\\\" true` do in the context of the Verus Desktop wallet?\\nAI Assistant: In the context of the Verus Desktop wallet, the command `run importprivkey \\\\\"<wif>\\\\\" \\\\\"\\\\\" true` is used to import a single WIF (Wallet Import Formatfor a public (transparent) address. Do you have any more questions about the wallet commands?\\n\\nUser: That's interesting. What is the purpose of the `settings` --> `Coin Settings` interface in the Verus Desktop wallet?\\nAI Assistant: The `settings` --> `Coin Settings` interface in the Verus Desktop wallet is used to select the chain you want to use, as well as the place where you'll enter the commands to import WIFs. Is there anything else you want to know about wallet commands or settings?\\n\\nUser: How does one import multiple WIFs in one batch for public (transparentaddresses in the Verus Desktop wallet?\\nAI Assistant: To import multiple WIFs in one batch for public (transparentaddresses in the Verus Desktop wallet, one needs to use the command `run importprivkey \\\\\"<wif>\\\\\" \\\\\"\\\\\" false` for every WIF except for the final one. For the final WIF, one needs to use the command `run importprivkey \\\\\"<wif>\\\\\" \\\\\"\\\\\" true`. Do you need any further assistance with wallet commands or settings?",
