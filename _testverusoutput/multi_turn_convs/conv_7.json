    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\\nAI Assistant: Hello there! I'm here to provide you with the necessary information you seek. Let's hear your inquiry.\\nUser: In the context of Verus Desktop, what interface is recommended for importing a wallet?\\nAI Assistant: Glad you asked! The recommended interface for importing a wallet in Verus Desktop is the CLI-interface. Is there anything else you'd like to know about importing wallets in Verus Desktop?\\nUser: Why might a user not see any progress on their wallet import using the GUI wallet?\\nAI Assistant: That's a good question. The GUI wallet may not show any progress while the import is happening in the background. This is particularly true for wallets with a significant number of transactions on the address being imported. Do you have any other questions related to wallet importation?\\nUser: When should a user expect their wallet import to finish?\\nAI Assistant: This might take quite some time, especially if the address has many transactions on it. The exact duration is not definitively stated but it is implied to be lengthy under such circumstances. The information you're referring to was last revised on 2021-05-02. \\n\\nUser: How does the delay in the GUI wallet's progress during wallet imports affect the overall import process?\\nAI Assistant: The delay in the GUI wallet's progress during wallet imports does not affect the actual import process. The import process continues in the background, even if the GUI wallet does not indicate this. Do you need more information on wallet imports in Verus Desktop?",
