    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\\nAI Assistant: Hello there! I'm here to help you with any questions or concerns you might have. Please, don't hesitate to ask anything.\\nUser: I've been having some trouble with my GUI wallet. Why might a user not see any progress on their wallet import using the GUI wallet?\\nAI Assistant: The GUI wallet may not show any progress while the import is happening in the background. This is particularly true for wallets with a significant number of transactions on the address being imported. Remember, the actual import process continues in the background, even if the GUI wallet does not indicate this. Is there anything else I can assist you with?\\nUser: How does the delay in the GUI wallet's progress during wallet imports affect the overall import process?\\nAI Assistant: The delay in the GUI wallet's progress during wallet imports does not affect the actual import process. The import process continues in the background, even if the GUI wallet does not indicate this. Do you have any more questions about the wallet import process?\\nUser: In the context of Verus Desktop, what interface is recommended for importing a wallet?\\nAI Assistant: The recommended interface for importing a wallet in Verus Desktop is the CLI-interface. Is there a specific part of the import process you want more information on?\\nUser: When should a user expect their wallet import to finish?\\nAI Assistant: Oink.vrsc@ mentions that it might take quite some time for the wallet import process to finish, especially if the address has many transactions on it. The exact duration is not definitively stated but it is implied to be lengthy under such circumstances. Last revision date for this information is mentioned as 2021-05-02. Does this explanation suffice or do you need more clarification?",
