    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\\nAI Assistant: Hello! I'm here to provide any information you may need. Please, feel free to ask anything.\\nUser: Hey there, I was wondering, what opportunity will FPGA manufacturers have regarding the VerusHash 2.1 algorithm?\\nAI Assistant: That's a good question. FPGA manufacturers will have the opportunity to mine and stake on the Verus network when the Verus economy starts to roll out and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency but should far exceed the potential for block rewards. Do you have any more questions about this?\\nUser: What impact did the VerusHash 2.1 algorithm have on the performance of FPGAs in comparison to that of CPUs?\\nAI Assistant: The VerusHash 2.1 algorithm made minor modifications necessary for FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm while also slightly tilting the balance more favorably toward CPUs, as per the developers' aims. Did you want to know more about this algorithm?\\nUser: What was the original intention of the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm?\\nAI Assistant: The original intention of the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the VerusHash algorithms?\\nUser: How did VerusHash 2.1 address the performance imbalance between FPGAs and CPUs?\\nAI Assistant: VerusHash 2.1 introduced an adjustment to the equalization technology, which slightly tilted the balance more favorably toward CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Do you have any more questions about VerusHash 2.1?",

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications.
