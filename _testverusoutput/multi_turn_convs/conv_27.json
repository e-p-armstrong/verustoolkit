    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\\nAI Assistant: Hello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\\nUser: I've been having some issues with my mining rewards. What should one do if it seems that their mining rewards suddenly seem to come to a halt, after following the procedures to solve a situation of being on their own fork because of a network issue or having an old version of the wallet?\\nAI Assistant: If it seems that your mining rewards suddenly seem to come to a halt, one should remember that when you mine to the wrong chain, the rewards can come in very quickly, but they are worth nothing. Therefore, there is no need to be dismayed; just continue with the appropriate backup, installation, or update procedures. Do you want to know more about resolving issues related to your wallet?\\nUser: Could you please outline the steps to update a wallet and efficiently rectify the problem caused by being on their own fork?\\nAI Assistant: Certainly. The procedure to follow involves: (1) Stopping the wallet/mining process by cleanly shutting down the program, (2) updating your wallet if necessary, and (3) following the procedure in [HOW-TO Backup, Install or Update and Bootstrap your wallet.md](#!how-to/how-to_bootstrap.md) to efficiently rectify the problem. Does that answer your question?\\nUser: That does help. But I'm also curious, what are the two main solutions to resolving a situation where one is on their own fork due to a network issue or having an old version of the wallet?\\nAI Assistant: The two solutions are (1) to simply install the latest bootstrap file, which requires less work but involves a large download, or (2) to search manually for the forked block and invalidate that block, which although is time-consuming, does not require any additional download. Is there anything else you'd like to know about resolving issues related to being on your own fork?\\nUser: One last thing, which terminal do I use when carrying out the Verus-Desktop Procedure 2?\\nAI Assistant: When carrying out the Verus-Desktop Procedure 2, the commands are all entered in the *Native Client Terminal*. This terminal can be accessed under `Settings`, `Coin Settings`. Is there anything else I can help you with?",
