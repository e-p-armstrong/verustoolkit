    "When should a user expect their wallet import to finish?",
    "Oink.vrsc@ mentions that it might take quite some time for the wallet import process to finish, especially if the address has many transactions on it. The exact duration is not definitively stated but it is implied to be lengthy under such circumstances. This information has its last revision date mentioned as 2021-05-02.",
    "Note: Don't use the WIF from the example above, but use the one from the CLI-interface in Verus Desktop. ### The GUI wallet will not show any progress on the import and may give messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting. It will take quite some time for the process to finish in the background, especially if the address has many transaction on it. Information compiled by Oink.vrsc@. Note: revision date 2021-05-02.",
