    "How do you check if the block hash your command gave you matches the block hash shown on the Verus explorer?",
    "Compare the block hash your command gave you against the block hash the Verus explorer shows. If they are the same, the block hash is correct. If they are different, the block hash from your command is incorrect.",
    "Search for the **earliest** block that not matches the blockchain:   `./verus getblockhash <suspected blocknumber>` will show you the blockhash for the blocknumber you filled in   The response will be similar to this:   `5cc7844973fb95ef17f1772ea4aba579f0d8273fb0ee6064cd8e707d1056c646` 2. Check the blockhash your command gave you against the blockhash the [explorer](https://explorer.verus.io) shows. 3. If the blockhash from the explorer is different than yours, repeat steps 1 & 2 until you find the earliest block that is different. 4. Use the **earliest incorrect blockhash** from your system to invalidate that block:   `./verus invalidateblock <earliest incorrect blockhash>`   The deamon will not give feedback on this command. 5. Now use the **correct blockhash** that the explorer gave you for the block you just locally invalidated:   `./verus reconsiderblock <correct blockhash>`   Again the daemon will not give feedback on this command. 6. Once your daemon connects to a node that is on the correct chain, it will quicly synchronize. If needed you can either restart your daemon to force new connections or manually disconnect bad nodes.
