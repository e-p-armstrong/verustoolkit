    "# How to import your Lite wallet address into your native Verus Desktop? Attention: Read it completely before using. ### Important General Information `verus command \"<userinput>\"` needs to be entered literally, with `<userinput>` replaced by your specific userdata. So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address, so it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`. This method is confirmed to work on Verus and all Komodo assetchains. ## Prerequisites In order to convert your seedphrase into a Private key (WIF), you need to have a running native wallet first, that is fully synchronized. The earliest wallet that supports these functions is **Verus Desktop v0.6.4-beta-1**. If needed, use this guide to quickly synchronize your wallet: https://wiki.verus.io/#!how-to/how-to_bootstrap.md ## Converting Seed to WIF If you have a seed, you can retrieve your Private key (WIF) by having the Verus Desktop wallet convert it for you.",
