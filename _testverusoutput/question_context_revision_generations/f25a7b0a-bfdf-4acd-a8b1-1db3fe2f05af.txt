In addition to the exposition of the principles of chemistry, it has been my desire to show how science has now been built up like a suspension bridge, supported by the united strength of a number of slender, but firmly-fixed, chains, which individually are of little strength, and has thus been carried over difficulties which before appeared insuperable.\" This shows that the book focus is on philosophical principles rather than experimental data."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Reasoning and thought process:\\n### Question Context Validation\\n#### Special Term Context Check: specifically check for use of the terms \"book\", \"text\", \"passage\", and \"excerpt\" without context about which specific thing is being discussed.
