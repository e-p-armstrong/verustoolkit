Their diet is primarily based on marine mammals, with seals being the most crucial part of their diet. Polar bears are skilled hunters, often waiting by seals' breathing holes to catch their prey. Occasionally, they also eat birds, bird eggs, and small mammals. They also consume significant amounts of berries and fish. These bears are known for their ability to survive in extreme conditions, thanks to their thick fur and fat layers which provide insulation, as well as their efficient digestion system, which makes good use of the few nutrients available.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"What are the primary food sources of polar bears?\"\"\"\\n\\nSupposed answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking): \"\"\"Polar bears primarily eat seals, but they also consume significant amounts of berries and fish.

He suggested that the unconscious mind stores feelings, thoughts, and desires that are too threatening or painful for conscious awareness. Freud believed that these repressed elements could influence behavior and personality. One of his key methods for exploring the unconscious mind was through dream analysis, where he interpreted the meaning of dreams as a pathway to understanding the hidden desires and thoughts of the individual.
