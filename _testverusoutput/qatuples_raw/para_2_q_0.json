    "What does the command `run importprivkey \\\"<wif>\\\" \\\"\\\" true` do in the context of the Verus Desktop wallet?",
    "In the context of the Verus Desktop wallet, the command `run importprivkey \\\"<wif>\\\" \\\"\\\" true` is used to import a single WIF (Wallet Import Formatfor a public (transparent) address.",
    "The 52-character string after **\"wif\":** that is shown, is what you want to import in the next step. ## Importing a single WIF for a public (transparent) address To import your address, go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner and enter the following command: ``` run importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" true ``` Replace `<wif>` with the actual **wif** you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier. Note: Don't use the WIF from the example above, but use the one from the CLI-interface in Verus Desktop. Note: The GUI wallet will not show any progress on the import and may give messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting. It will take quite some time for the process to finish in the background, especially if the address has many transaction on it. ## Importing multiple WIFs in one batch for public (transparent) addresses To import your address, go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner and enter the following command for every WIF except for the final one: ``` run importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" false ``` Import the final WIF with this command: ``` run importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" true ``` The last command triggers the chain to rescan all addresses in your wallet, including all the addresses you just imported. Replace `<wif>` with the actual **wif** (like the one you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier). Note: Don't use the WIF from the example above, but use the one from the CLI-interface in Verus Desktop.",
