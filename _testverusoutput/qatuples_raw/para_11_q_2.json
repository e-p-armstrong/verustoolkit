    "How does the delay in the GUI wallet's progress during wallet imports affect the overall import process?",
    "The delay in the GUI wallet's progress during wallet imports does not affect the actual import process. The import process continues in the background, even if the GUI wallet does not indicate this.",
    "Note: Don't use the WIF from the example above, but use the one from the CLI-interface in Verus Desktop. ### The GUI wallet will not show any progress on the import and may give messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting. It will take quite some time for the process to finish in the background, especially if the address has many transaction on it. Information compiled by Oink.vrsc@. Note: revision date 2021-05-02.",
