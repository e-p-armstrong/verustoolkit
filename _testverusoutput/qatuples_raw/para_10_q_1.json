    "How does one find the earliest block that deviates from the blockchain?",
    "One needs to successively use the command `run getblockhash <suspected blocknumber>`, then verify the result using the explorer at https://explorer.verus.io. This process should be repeated until a different blockhash (other than the blockchain'sis found.",
    "Search for the **earliest** block that not matches the blockchain:   `run getblockhash <suspected blocknumber>` will show you the blockhash for the blocknumber you filled in   The response shown in the *Native Client Terminal* will be similar to this:   `5cc7844973fb95ef17f1772ea4aba579f0d8273fb0ee6064cd8e707d1056c646` 3. Check the blockhash your command gave you against the blockhash the [explorer](https://explorer.verus.io) shows. 4. If the blockhash from the explorer is different than yours, repeat steps 2 & 3 until you find the earliest block that is different. 5. Use the **earliest incorrect blockhash** from your system to invalidate that block:   `run invalidateblock <earliest incorrect blockhash>`   The *Native Client Terminal* will not give feedback on this command. 6. Now use the **correct blockhash** that the explorer gave you for the block you just locally invalidated:   `run reconsiderblock <correct blockhash>`   Again the *Native Client Terminal* will not give feedback on this command. 7. Once your wallet connects to a node that is on the correct chain, it will quicly synchronize. If needed you can either restart your wallet to force new connections or manually disconnect bad nodes. ### CLI 1.",
