# Set up multisig for VerusID
With multisig, you can set up a wallet that requires multiple signatures to send a transaction. 

For example, you could set up a wallet that requires two out of three possible signatures before a transaction can be sent.

A multisig VerusID can be up to **13 of 25 signatures**. It can also be 13 of 13; 1 of 25; and of course 1 of 1.
