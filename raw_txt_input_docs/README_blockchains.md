# Introduction
Launch blockchains that are ✅ **fully interoperable**, ✅ **customizable** and ✅ **independent**. Each blockchain launched has the following L1 features.


| Feature | Details | 
| :-----| :------ | 
| [L1 Multi-currency](/currencies/) | Consensus layer basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools) & simple token currencies, decentralized crowdfund mechanisms |
| [L1 DeFi](/sendcurrency/) | Consensus layer AMMs, MEV-free, no front/back-running, solving all conversions simultaneously within a block & fully decentralized marketplace | 
| [L1 VerusID](/verusid/) | Consensus layer self-sovereign identities, namespace for currencies, tokens & PBaaS-blockchains, friendly-name addresses, revocable, recoverable, NFTs, profiles, can be bound to any type of data | 
| L1 Privacy | Consensus layer zk-SNARKs privacy technology |
| 51% hash attack resistant | 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake. [Read the paper here.](https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf) |
| 75 - 800 TPS | High performance blockchain, adjustable block times 10 secs - 2 mins |
| Scaling | Scale out by deploying more interoperable, interconnected PBaaS-chains |


It costs 10,000 VRSC to launch a PBaaS-chain. 5000 goes to the Verus block producers, 5000 goes to the block producers of the newly launched chain.

## Launch without programming needed
Enables any user with VerusID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, VerusID-issuing 50% PoW/50% PoS, [51% hash attack resistant](https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf) blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it.

All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, VerusID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.

## DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
Any VerusID owner may define basket currencies, with one or more reserves backing the currency, at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. 

The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular basket currency, and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi basket currencies directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.

## Bridge converter launches
Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. 

Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other  100% asset backed or partially asset backed basket currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.

## Crowdfunding currency and blockchain launches
Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. 

The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.

## Interoperable, multichain network
The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. 

Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. 

There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
