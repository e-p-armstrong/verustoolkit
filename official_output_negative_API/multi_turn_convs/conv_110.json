    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having trouble with generating blocks on the mainnet. Can you tell me how to generate blocks on the mainnet using the `generate` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `generate` command can only be used on the regtest network, not on the mainnet. It's specifically designed for testing purposes, allowing you to generate a specified number of blocks immediately. You can't use it to generate blocks on the mainnet.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. What if I run the `generate` command without specifying a number? Is there a default number of blocks that gets generated?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, there is no default number of blocks generated when running the `generate` command without specifying a number. You must provide the `numblocks` argument, which specifies how many blocks to generate immediately. If you don't provide a number, the command won't work.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And one more question: can I use the `generate` command to generate blocks in the background, without blocking the RPC call?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `generate` command mines blocks immediately, before the RPC call returns. It does not generate blocks in the background. The command will block until the specified number of blocks are generated.",
