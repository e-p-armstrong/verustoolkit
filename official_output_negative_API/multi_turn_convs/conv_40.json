    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to figure out how to use the `submitacceptednotarization` command. Can you walk me through how to use it to create a new notarization transaction from scratch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not exactly how the `submitacceptednotarization` command works. It doesn't create a new notarization transaction from scratch. Instead, it finishes an almost complete notarization transaction based on the notary chain and the current wallet or pubkey. It requires two arguments: `earnednotarization` and `notaryevidence`, which are used to validate the notarization.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I understand. What happens if the transaction isn't successful? What does the `submitacceptednotarization` command return in that case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the transaction is not successful, the `submitacceptednotarization` command returns NULL. It doesn't return an error message or any other value.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. One more question. Can I use the `submitacceptednotarization` command to submit a transaction to any blockchain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `submitacceptednotarization` command is specific to the Verus network and is used to finish an almost complete notarization transaction based on the notary chain and the current wallet or pubkey. It's not a general-purpose transaction submission command that can be used with any blockchain network.",
