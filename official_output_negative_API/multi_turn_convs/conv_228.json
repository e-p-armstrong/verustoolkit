    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to understand how to use the `makeoffer` command on Verus. Can you explain how it's used for centralized asset exchanges?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there may be some confusion. The `makeoffer` command is not used for centralized asset exchanges on Verus. In fact, it's used for completely decentralized, fully on-chain atomic swaps of any blockchain asset, including currencies, NFTs, identities, contractual agreements, and rights transfers. This command allows for decentralized swapping of assets without the need for a centralized exchange.\n\n**User:**\nI see! I must have misunderstood. Is the `makeoffer` command limited to swapping only two specific assets then?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not at all! The `makeoffer` command is quite flexible. It can be used to swap any blockchain asset, including multiple currencies, NFTs, identities, contractual agreements, and rights transfers. Additionally, it can be used to create bids for on-chain auctions of any blockchain asset(s).\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really powerful. Does the `makeoffer` command require a specific address to send funds from?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it doesn't! The `fromaddress` argument can be a VerusID, or a wildcard address such as `*`, `R*`, or `i*`. This allows for flexibility in specifying the source of funds for the swap. So, you have a lot of options when using the `makeoffer` command.",
