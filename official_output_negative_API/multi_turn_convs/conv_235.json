    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with the `z_shieldcoinbase` command. Can you tell me how to use it without specifying any parameters?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! Unfortunately, it's not possible to use the `z_shieldcoinbase` command without specifying any parameters. The command requires at least two parameters: the zaddr to shield from and the taddr to shield to. The correct syntax is `verus z_shieldcoinbase <zaddr> <taddr>`.\n\nYou'll need to provide both a zaddr and a taddr for the command to work properly. If you're unsure about the parameters or how to u\u017cy\u0107 them, I'd be happy to help you with that as well!",
