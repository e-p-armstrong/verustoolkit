    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `z_getnewaddress` command, but I'm not sure how it works. Can you explain how to use it to get a transparent address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `z_getnewaddress` command doesn't return a transparent address. It returns a new shielded address for receiving payments, specifically a Sapling address by default, or a Sprout address if specified as an argument.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. I was under the impression that it returned multiple addresses. Does the `z_getnewaddress` command return an array of addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `z_getnewaddress` command returns a single string value, which is the new shielded address. It doesn't return an array of addresses.",
