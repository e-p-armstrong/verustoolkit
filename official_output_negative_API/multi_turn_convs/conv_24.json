    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm playing around with the Verus CLI and I was wondering about the `getlaunchinfo` command. What's the purpose of it if you don't specify a currencyid?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getlaunchinfo` command requires a currencyid as an argument. It returns the launch notarization data and partial transaction proof of the launch notarization for the specified currencyid. If you don't specify a currencyid, the command will not work as intended. You need to provide a currencyid to get the desired information.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, can I use the `getlaunchinfo` command to get information about a specific transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getlaunchinfo` command is used to retrieve the launch notarization data and partial transaction proof of the launch notarization for a specific currencyid, not for a specific transaction. It returns information related to the launch of a currency, not a specific transaction. If you need information about a specific transaction, you'll need to use a different command.",
