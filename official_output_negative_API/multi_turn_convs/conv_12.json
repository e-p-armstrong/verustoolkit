    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `verus` command `getrawtransaction` and I'm a bit confused. What is the purpose of `getrawtransaction` with two arguments, where the second argument is a string?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getrawtransaction` command with two arguments doesn't actually take a string as its second argument. Instead, it takes an integer, which specifies the verbosity of the output. For example, `verus getrawtransaction \"mytxid\" 1` retrieves the raw transaction with the specified ID and returns it in a verbose format. Does that clear things up?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But I'm also trying to use the `curl` command to send a `getrawtransaction` request to the Verus API. How do I do that without authentication?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm afraid you can't use the `curl` command to send a `getrawtransaction` request to the Verus API without authentication. As shown in the example, you need to provide a username (`--user myusername`) to authenticate the request. Without authentication, the API will reject the request. You need to authenticate your request to access the API.",
