    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `submitmergedblock` command, but I'm not sure what to expect from the result. Can you tell me what the format of the result is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `submitmergedblock` command returns a JSON object with different fields depending on the outcome of the submission. If the submission is rejected, the result will be `\"  { rejected: \"reject reason\" }\"`. This will give you an idea of why the submission wasn't successful.\n\nIf the submission is successful, the result will be either `\"  { blockhash: \"hex\", accepted: true, pbaas_submissions: { \"Quantum\":\"chainID_hex\", ... } }\"` for submission to both Verus and PBaaS chains, or `\"  { blockhash: \"hex\", accepted: \"pbaas\", pbaas_submissions: { \"Quantum\":\"chainID_hex\", ... } }\"` for submission to only PBaaS chains.\n\nIn the successful cases, the `blockhash` field will contain the hash of the submitted block, and the `accepted` field will indicate whether the block was accepted by the Verus network. The `pbaas_submissions` field will contain information about the submission to PBaaS chains, with the chain name as the key and the chain ID as the value.\n\nDoes that help clarify things for you?",
