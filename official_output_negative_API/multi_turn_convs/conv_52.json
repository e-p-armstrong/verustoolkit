    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about the `ping` command in Verus. How do I use it to get an immediate response from all other nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `ping` command doesn't quite work like that. The `ping` command is not handled immediately, but rather is queued with all other commands. This means that it does not provide an immediate response, but rather measures the processing backlog, which includes the time it takes to process commands in the queue. So, you won't get an immediate response from all other nodes using the `ping` command.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I understand. That's a bit different from what I expected. So, when I do use the `ping` command, what units are the results provided in?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe results of the `ping` command, specifically the `pingtime` and `pingwait` fields, are provided in decimal seconds, not milliseconds or any other unit. So, when you run the `ping` command, you can expect to see the results in decimal seconds.",
