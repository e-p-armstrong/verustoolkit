    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have some questions about using Verus commands. Specifically, I'm trying to use the `getidentitieswithrecovery` command. Can I use this command to get all identities where the specified ID is the owner of the identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getidentitieswithrecovery` command doesn't quite work that way. Instead, it returns all identities where the specified ID or i-address is the recovery authority. So, it's looking for identities where the specified ID has the power to recover the identity, not where it's the owner.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. What if I don't specify the `fromheight` and `toheight` arguments in the `getidentitieswithrecovery` command? What will happen then?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't specify the `fromheight` and `toheight` arguments, they will default to 0. This means that the command will search for qualified identities from the genesis block (height 0) forward, with no upper limit on the block height. So, it will search through the entire blockchain history to find identities where the specified ID is the recovery authority.",
