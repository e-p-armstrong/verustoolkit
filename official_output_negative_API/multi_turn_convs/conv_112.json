    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand how to use the `getaddressesbyaccount` method. Can you explain its purpose and how to use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getaddressesbyaccount` method returns a list of addresses associated with a given account. To use it, you need to pass the account name as a string argument. However, if you want to represent the default account, you must pass an empty string `\"\"` instead. For example: `verus getaddressesbyaccount \"\"`.\n\n**User:**\nSo, I can pass any string as the \"account\" argument to `getaddressesbyaccount`, and it will work correctly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot pass any string as the \"account\" argument to `getaddressesbyaccount`. According to the documentation, passing any string other than an empty string `\"\"` will result in an error. The empty string `\"\"` represents the default account. You need to be specific about the account you're trying to retrieve addresses for.",
