    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there! I'm trying to use the `decoderawtransaction` method with the Verus CLI, but I'm not sure if I need to specify a username. Is it possible to use the `decoderawtransaction` method with the Verus CLI without specifying a username?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, it is possible to use the `decoderawtransaction` method with the Verus CLI without specifying a username. You can simply run `verus decoderawtransaction \"hexstring\"` without providing a username. However, when using the JSON-RPC API with `curl`, you do need to specify a username, as shown in the example: `curl --user myusername ...`. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks for clarifying! I was also wondering, does the `decoderawtransaction` method only work with the Verus JSON-RPC API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `decoderawtransaction` method can be used with both the Verus CLI and the Verus JSON-RPC API. The provided examples show how to use the method with both the CLI (`verus decoderawtransaction \"hexstring\"`) and the JSON-RPC API (`curl ...`). You can choose the method that best fits your needs. Do you have any more questions about using the `decoderawtransaction` method or Verus in general?",
