    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with banning IP addresses. Can you help me out? How do I use the `listbanned` command to ban a specific IP address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's a misunderstanding here. The `listbanned` command is actually used to list all banned IPs/Subnets, not to ban a specific IP address. It doesn't have the functionality to add new bans. The correct usage of `listbanned` is to retrieve a list of currently banned IPs/Subnets, as shown in the examples: `verus listbanned` or using the JSON-RPC method with `curl`. If you want to ban an IP address, you'll need to use a different command.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see! Thanks for the correction. I was also wondering, what is the default port used by the `listbanned` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listbanned` command doesn't have a default port. The port number `27486` might be used in some examples, but it's not a default port. The port number might be specific to the setup or configuration of the system.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! One more question. Can I use the `listbanned` command to whitelist an IP address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `listbanned` command is only used to list banned IPs/Subnets, not to whitelist an IP address. It doesn't have the functionality to add or manage whitelisted IPs. Its purpose is to retrieve a list of currently banned IPs/Subnets. If you want to whitelist an IP address, you'll need to use a different command or method.",
