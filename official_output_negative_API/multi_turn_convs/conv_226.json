    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been experimenting with the `getaddressdeltas` command and I noticed something that seems a bit odd. Can you explain why the `getaddressdeltas` command does not require the `addressindex` to be enabled?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some confusion here. The `getaddressdeltas` command does require the `addressindex` to be enabled. This is explicitly stated in the documentation. It's possible that you might have misunderstood or misread the documentation. If you're still unsure, I can try to help you troubleshoot or provide more information on how to use the `getaddressdeltas` command correctly.",
