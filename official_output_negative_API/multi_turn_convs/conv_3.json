    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `getblockhashes` command to get the hashes of all blocks in the entire blockchain. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I have to clarify that the `getblockhashes` command doesn't quite work the way you think it does. It doesn't return the hashes of all blocks in the entire blockchain. Instead, it returns an array of hashes of blocks within a specific timestamp range provided as arguments. You need to specify a `high` and `low` timestamp to define the range of blocks you're interested in.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. Thanks for the clarification! But what if I want to get the hashes of blocks that are not on the main chain? Is that possible with `getblockhashes`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use the `getblockhashes` command to get the hashes of blocks that are not on the main chain, but only if you set `\"noOrphans\":false` in the `options` argument. If you set `\"noOrphans\":true`, the command will only return hashes of blocks on the main chain. So, by setting `\"noOrphans\":false`, you can include blocks that are not part of the main chain in your query.",
