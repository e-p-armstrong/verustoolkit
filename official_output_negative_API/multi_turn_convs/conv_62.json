    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there, I'm trying to use the `registernamecommitment` method to register a commitment with a specified identity address. Can you show me how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `registernamecommitment` method doesn't quite work like that. It doesn't take an identity address as a parameter. Instead, it takes a single parameter, which is the unique name to be registered. The identity address is actually returned as part of the result object, in the `namereservation` section, under the key `nameid`. Would you like more information on how to use the `registernamecommitment` method?\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand. But I'm still a bit unclear about something. I've been told that the `registernamecommitment` method requires a referral address as a mandatory parameter. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The `registernamecommitment` method does not require a referral address as a mandatory parameter. The referral address is actually an optional parameter, stored in the `namereservation` section of the result object under the key `referral`. It is used to specify the address of the referring identity, if there is one. So, you don't need to provide a referral address when using the `registernamecommitment` method, unless you want to specify one.",
