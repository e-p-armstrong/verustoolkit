    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about the \"eras\" array. How do I specify a maximum of 5 eras in the \"eras\" array?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the \"eras\" array does not have a maximum limit of 5 eras. It can hold up to 3 eras. Each era object in the array contains properties such as \"reward\", \"decay\", \"halving\", and \"eraend\". You can't specify more than 3 eras in the \"eras\" array. Does that clarify things for you?",
