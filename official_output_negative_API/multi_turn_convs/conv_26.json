    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `estimatepriority` command to figure out how much I need to pay in fees for a transaction to be confirmed within a certain number of blocks. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. The `estimatepriority` command doesn't actually estimate the fee needed for a transaction. Instead, it estimates the approximate priority a zero-fee transaction needs to begin confirmation within a certain number of blocks. The command takes one argument, `nblocks`, which is the number of blocks within which you want the transaction to be confirmed.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. So what does a result of 0.0 mean when using the `estimatepriority` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, a result of 0.0 is not a documented result of the `estimatepriority` command. A result of -1.0 is returned if not enough transactions and blocks have been observed to make an estimate.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question: can I use the `estimatepriority` command to estimate the priority of a transaction that already has a fee?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `estimatepriority` command is specifically designed to estimate the priority of a zero-fee transaction. It doesn't estimate the priority of transactions that already have a fee.",
