    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `z_getbalance` command to send VRSC to an address, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. The `z_getbalance` command is not actually used to send VRSC to an address. Instead, it returns the balance of a taddr or zaddr belonging to the node's wallet. It takes two arguments: the address to check, and an optional minimum number of confirmations. The result is the total amount of VRSC received for that address. If you want to send VRSC, you'll need to use a different command. Would you like me to explain how to do that?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, thanks for the clarification. What's the default minimum confirmation number for the `z_getbalance` command, by the way?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default minimum confirmation number for the `z_getbalance` command is 1. If you don't specify a `minconf` argument, it will default to 1.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. One more question: can I use the `z_getbalance` command to detect spends on an address with only an incoming viewing key?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use the `z_getbalance` command to detect spends on an address with only an incoming viewing key. In fact, the command's documentation explicitly warns that if the wallet has only an incoming viewing key for the address, then spends cannot be detected, and so the returned balance may be larger than the actual balance.",
