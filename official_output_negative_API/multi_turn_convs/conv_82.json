    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand some of the commands in Verus. Can you help me out? What is the default number of blocks used by the `getnetworkhashps` command to estimate the network solutions per second?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default number of blocks used by the `getnetworkhashps` command is 120. You can override this by passing a different number as an argument, or use -1 to specify blocks over the difficulty averaging window. However, I should note that `getnetworkhashps` is actually a deprecated command...\n\n**User:**\nWait, what? I didn't know that. Is the `getnetworkhashps` command still the recommended way to estimate network solutions per second?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getnetworkhashps` command is actually deprecated and left for backwards-compatibility only. The recommended way to estimate network solutions per second is to use the `getnetworksolps` command instead. It's always a good idea to check the documentation and keep your knowledge up to date, as commands and recommendations can change over time!",
