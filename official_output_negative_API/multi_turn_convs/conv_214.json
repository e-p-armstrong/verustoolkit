    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get a list of all connected nodes using the `getconnectioncount` command. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. The `getconnectioncount` command doesn't actually return a list of connected nodes. Instead, it returns the number of connections to other nodes. If you want to get a list of connected nodes, you'll need to use a different command.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. So, what's the default port used by the `getconnectioncount` command then?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is no default port specified for the `getconnectioncount` command. However, in the example using `curl`, the port `27486` is specified. This suggests that the port number may need to be provided when using the `getconnectioncount` command.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. And one more thing - can I use the `getconnectioncount` command to disconnect from other nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getconnectioncount` command is used to retrieve the number of connections to other nodes, not to disconnect from them. It's a read-only command that provides information about the current state of connections, but it doesn't allow you to modify or disconnect from those connections.",
