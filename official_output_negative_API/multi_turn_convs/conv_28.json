    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand how to work with transactions in Verus. Can you help me with that? Specifically, what is the purpose of the `sendrawtransaction` command, and why does it only work with already confirmed transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help clarify! The `sendrawtransaction` command is actually used to submit a raw transaction (serialized, hex-encoded) to the local node and network. It's not limited to only working with already confirmed transactions. You can use it to send a newly created transaction to the network, allowing it to be processed and confirmed by the network.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I think I might have misunderstood the documentation. Speaking of which, can you explain why the `sendrawtransaction` command requires three arguments: the hex string of the raw transaction, the sender's private key, and the recipient's public key?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `sendrawtransaction` command doesn't require three arguments. According to the documentation, it only requires two arguments: the hex string of the raw transaction (required) and an optional `allowhighfees` boolean flag (defaulting to `false`). The sender's private key and the recipient's public key are not required arguments for this command.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I understand now. So how do I use the `sendrawtransaction` command to create a new transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou don't actually use the `sendrawtransaction` command to create a new transaction. Instead, you would use the `createrawtransaction` command to create a raw transaction. Then, you can sign that transaction using the `signrawtransaction` command, and finally submit it to the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command. So, `sendrawtransaction` is more like the final step in the process, rather than the first step. Does that make sense?",
