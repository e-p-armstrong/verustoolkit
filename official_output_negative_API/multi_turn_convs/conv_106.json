    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with the `getvdxfid` command, but I'm not entirely sure about its limitations. Can the `getvdxfid` command only be used with VDXF keys?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getvdxfid` command is not limited to just VDXF keys. It can also be used with i-addresses, which can be combined with the VDXF key via a hash to produce the final result. So, you have more flexibility than you might have thought!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! Now, I'm curious about the result of the `getvdxfid` command. What is the format of the result returned by the `getvdxfid` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `getvdxfid` command is an object with several properties. Specifically, it includes `vdxfid` (a base58check string), `hash160result` (a 20-byte hash in hex), `qualifiedname` (an object with `name` and `parentid` or `namespace` properties), and `bounddata` (an object with `vdxfkey`, `uint256`, and `indexnum` properties, if additional data is bound to create the value). So, you get a pretty detailed response with all the information you need!",
