    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring the transaction result in Verus and I'm a bit confused about the \"confirmations\" field. Can you explain why it indicates the number of miners who have verified the transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the \"confirmations\" field in the transaction result doesn't indicate the number of miners who have verified the transaction. Instead, it indicates the number of blocks that have been added to the blockchain since the transaction was included in a block. So, it's a measure of how many blocks have been built on top of the block that contains the transaction, which gives an idea of how confirmed the transaction is.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Another thing I'm not sure about is the \"account\" field in the transaction details. Why is it still used to store the account name involved in the transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"account\" field in the transaction details is actually deprecated and should not be used. It may be an empty string for the default account. Instead, you should use the \"address\" field to identify the VRSC address involved in the transaction. The \"address\" field is the one that contains the actual information about the address involved in the transaction.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been looking at the \"vjoinsplit\" field in the transaction result and I'm not sure what it does. Does it store information about the transaction's impact on the blockchain's overall hash rate?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the \"vjoinsplit\" field in the transaction result doesn't store information about the transaction's impact on the blockchain's overall hash rate. Instead, it stores information related to the transaction's joinsplit data, including the anchor, nullifiers, commitments, macs, vpub_old, and vpub_new values. It's a specific type of data that's used in certain types of transactions, and it's not related to the blockchain's hash rate.",
