    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm playing around with the Verus CLI on the testnet and I noticed the `getdeprecationinfo` command. What's the purpose of that command on the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getdeprecationinfo` command is not really applicable on the testnet. It's a command that's meant for the mainnet. When you run it on the mainnet, it returns an object containing the current version and deprecation block height.\n\n**User:**\nSo, can I use the `getdeprecationinfo` command to get information about the block height at which this version will upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not exactly. The `getdeprecationinfo` command actually returns the block height at which this version will deprecate and shut down, not upgrade. So, it's more about knowing when a version will become outdated and unusable, rather than when it will be upgraded to a new version.",
