    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to figure out how to use the `z_listoperationids` command, can you help me out? What's the purpose of this command, and how do I use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_listoperationids` command returns a list of operation IDs currently known to the wallet. You can use it to retrieve a list of operation IDs, and optionally filter the results by the operation's state (e.g., \"success\"). The command does not have any functionality related to sending new operations to the wallet.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was trying to use it to delete an operation from the wallet, but it didn't seem to work. Can you explain how to use the `z_listoperationids` command to delete an operation from the wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been a misunderstanding! The `z_listoperationids` command doesn't have the functionality to delete an operation from the wallet. It simply returns a list of operation IDs currently known to the wallet. If you need to delete an operation, you would need to use a different command or method.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification! One more question - what's the default filter for the `z_listoperationids` command, if no \"status\" argument is provided?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_listoperationids` command doesn't have a default filter. If no \"status\" argument is provided, the command will return all operation IDs currently known to the wallet, without any filtering.",
