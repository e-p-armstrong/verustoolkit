    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with the `getidentityhistory` command. Can I use it without specifying the identity name or i-address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't use the `getidentityhistory` command without specifying the identity name or i-address. The command requires a string argument in the format \"name@ || iid\" which is the name followed by \"@\" or the i-address of the identity. This is a required argument and must be provided. You can't use it to get a general history or something like that. It's specifically designed to retrieve the history of a specific identity.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Thanks for clarifying that. Another question I had is, can I use the `getidentityhistory` command to get the history of a specific transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getidentityhistory` command doesn't return the history of a specific transaction. It returns the history of an identity, including all transactions related to that identity, within the specified height range. If you want to get the history of a specific transaction, you would need to use a different command or method. The `getidentityhistory` command is more focused on providing a comprehensive history of an identity, rather than a specific transaction.",
