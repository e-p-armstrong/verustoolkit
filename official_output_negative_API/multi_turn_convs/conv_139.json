    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with the `listunspent` command. It doesn't seem to be returning any transaction outputs with less than 100 confirmations. Is that normal behavior?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listunspent` command actually returns transaction outputs with between `minconf` and `maxconf` confirmations, inclusive. By default, `minconf` is 1, which means it will return transaction outputs with at least 1 confirmation. If you want to filter out transaction outputs with less than 100 confirmations, you can specify `minconf` as 100. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! Another question about `listunspent`: how do I use it to filter transaction outputs by a specific transaction ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the `listunspent` command doesn't have an option to filter by a specific transaction ID. It can only filter by addresses using the `\"addresses\"` argument, which is a JSON array of VRSC addresses. If you want to get information about a specific transaction, you may need to use a different command.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the `includeshared` argument in the `listunspent` command? What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `includeshared` argument is used to include outputs that can also be spent by others. It is a boolean argument that defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the command will return outputs that are shared with other users, in addition to outputs that can only be spent by the current user.",
