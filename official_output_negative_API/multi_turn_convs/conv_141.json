    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the Verus CLI and I'm curious about the `listaddressgroupings` command. What's its purpose, and why does it only list individual addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listaddressgroupings` command lists groups of addresses which have had their common ownership made public by common use as inputs or as the resulting change in past transactions. It doesn't only list individual addresses, but rather groups of addresses that are related by their common ownership.\n\n**User:**\nI see. That makes sense. But when I run the command, it returns a single array of addresses and their corresponding amounts. Can you explain why that is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listaddressgroupings` command actually returns an array of arrays, where each inner array represents a group of addresses with their corresponding amounts. This is because the command is designed to show groups of addresses that are related by their common ownership, rather than just listing individual addresses. So, each inner array is a grouping of addresses that are connected by their common use in transactions. Does that clarify things?",
