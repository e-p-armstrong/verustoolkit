    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm playing around with `z_listunspent` and I was wondering, what is the default value of `minconf` and `maxconf` when calling it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default value of `minconf` is 1, and the default value of `maxconf` is 9999999. Do you have any other questions about `z_listunspent` or how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. When calling `z_listunspent`, can I filter the results to only include notes sent to a specific network instead of a specific address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can only filter the results to include notes sent to specific addresses, not specific networks. The `\"addresses\"` argument is a json array of zaddrs to filter on. You can't filter by network, only by address.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification. And one more question: Can I use `z_listunspent` to list unspent notes with more than `maxconf` confirmations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, `maxconf` is the maximum number of confirmations to filter, so `z_listunspent` will only return notes with up to `maxconf` confirmations, not more. It's a cap, not a floor.",
