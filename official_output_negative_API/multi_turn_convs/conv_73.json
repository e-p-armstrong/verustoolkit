    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the `getsnapshot` command in Verus. Can I use it to get a snapshot of the blockchain at a specific block height or time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, the `getsnapshot` command doesn't work that way. It returns a snapshot of (address,amount) pairs at the current height, not at a specific block height or time. However, it does provide some additional information that might be helpful. The snapshot includes the block height and Unix epoch time when the snapshot was started and finished. So while you can't specify a specific block height or time, you can still get some context about when the snapshot was taken.",
