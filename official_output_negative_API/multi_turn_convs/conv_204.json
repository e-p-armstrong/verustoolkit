    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to use the `zcrawjoinsplit` command to make my transactions completely transparent. Can you tell me how I can do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to help! However, I have to clarify that the `zcrawjoinsplit` command is actually used to create confidential transactions, not transparent ones. The inputs are unilaterally confidential, and the outputs are confidential between the sender and receiver. Only the `vpub_old` and `vpub_new` values are globally public, and they are used to move transparent value into or out of the confidential value store.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. I must have misunderstood. Can I at least use the `zcrawjoinsplit` command to create transactions without any confidential information?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, unfortunately not. The `zcrawjoinsplit` command is specifically designed to create transactions with confidential information. It's used to splice a joinsplit into a raw transaction, and the inputs and outputs are designed to be confidential. If you need to create a transaction without confidential information, you would need to use a different command or method. Would you like me to suggest an alternative solution?",
