    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having some trouble with the `sendfrom` command. How do I use it to send VRSC from a specific account to another account, without specifying the \"toVRSCaddress\" argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to help! Unfortunately, it's not possible to use the `sendfrom` command without specifying the \"toVRSCaddress\" argument. The \"toVRSCaddress\" argument is required and must be a valid VRSC address. If you don't specify it, the command will result in an error. You'll need to provide the address you want to send the VRSC to.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering, can I use the `sendfrom` command to send an amount less than 0.00000001 VRSC?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use the `sendfrom` command to send an amount less than 0.00000001 VRSC. The amount is rounded to the nearest 0.00000001, so sending an amount less than that would be rounded to 0, and it would not be possible to send it. The minimum amount you can send using the `sendfrom` command is 0.00000001 VRSC.",
