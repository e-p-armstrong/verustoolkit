    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to use the `decryptdata` command, but I'm not really sure what it's for or how it works. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `decryptdata` command is used to decrypt a vdxf data descriptor, which is typically encrypted to a z-address. If you want to encrypt data, you should use the `signdata` command instead. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps a bit, thanks! I was also wondering, if I use the `decryptdata` command, will it always return a fully decrypted object, even if only one of the viewing keys or the ssk is correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `decryptdata` command won't always return a fully decrypted object. If either the viewing key or the ssk is correct, the object will be returned with as much decryption as possible completed. If no decryption is possible, the command will return an error. It's not an all-or-nothing situation, but rather the command will do its best to decrypt as much of the object as it can with the keys you provide.",
