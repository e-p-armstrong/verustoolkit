    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `dumpwallet` command to export my wallet keys, but I have a few questions about how to use it. How do I use the `dumpwallet` command to overwrite an existing file with my wallet keys?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can't. The `dumpwallet` command does not permit overwriting an existing file. If you try to use the command with a filename that already exists, it will not work. You'll need to use a different filename or delete the existing file before running the command.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. What is the default value of the `omitemptytaddresses` argument in the `dumpwallet` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default value of the `omitemptytaddresses` argument is `false`. This means that by default, the `dumpwallet` command will export all taddr wallet keys, not just those with indexed UTXOs or that control IDs in the wallet.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Can I use the `dumpwallet` command without specifying a filename?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot. The `filename` argument is required when using the `dumpwallet` command. You must specify a filename for the command to work correctly.",
