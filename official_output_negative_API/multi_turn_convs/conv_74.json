    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to configure my Verus setup, and I'm not sure about a few things. What is the maximum number of nodes that can be specified in the \"nodes\" array?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe maximum number of nodes that can be specified in the \"nodes\" array is 8. So, you can specify up to 8 nodes in that array.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! I also have a question about \"nodeidentity\". Can I specify a \"nodeidentity\" as an integer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot specify a \"nodeidentity\" as an integer. A \"nodeidentity\" is a string, and it can be an internet, TOR, or other supported address for the node.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, I'll make sure to use a string for \"nodeidentity\". One more question: what is the data type of \"paymentaddress\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe data type of \"paymentaddress\" is an integer (int). It represents the rewards payment address.",
