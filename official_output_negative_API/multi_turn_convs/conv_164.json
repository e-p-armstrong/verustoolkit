    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having a bit of trouble with the `scanNotarisationsDB` command. I'm trying to scan forward from a given block height for a notarisation of a specific symbol. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `scanNotarisationsDB` command doesn't scan forward from a given block height. It scans backwards from a given block height for a notarisation of a specific symbol.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. So how do I use it correctly then?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe correct usage is `scanNotarisationsDB blockHeight symbol [blocksLimit=1440]`, where `blockHeight` is the starting point for the backward scan.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! Thanks for the clarification. I'll make sure to use it correctly from now on.",
