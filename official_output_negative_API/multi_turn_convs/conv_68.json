    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `getcurrencybalance` command to send some cryptocurrency to another address, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I need to correct you - the `getcurrencybalance` command is not used to send cryptocurrency to another address. It's actually used to retrieve the balance of a specific address in all currencies, belonging to the node's wallet. To send cryptocurrency, you would need to use a different command, such as `sendcurrency`. Would you like me to explain how to use `sendcurrency`?\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see! I was confused about how `getcurrencybalance` works. Does it only work with transparent addresses, by the way?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getcurrencybalance` command can work with both transparent and private addresses, as well as wildcard addresses (such as z*, R*, and i*). It's a versatile command that can retrieve balance information for a wide range of address types. If you have any more questions about how to use `getcurrencybalance` or `sendcurrency`, feel free to ask!",
