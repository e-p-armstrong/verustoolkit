    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with some commands in Verus. I was wondering if I can use the `getbestblockhash` command to get the hash of a specific block by its height?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the answer is no. You cannot use the `getbestblockhash` command to get the hash of a specific block by its height. This command only returns the hash of the best (tip) block in the longest block chain, without allowing you to specify a particular block height. You'll need to use a different command or approach to achieve that.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. One more question about `getbestblockhash`. Does it return the block hash in a decimal format?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getbestblockhash` command returns the block hash in a hexadecimal (hex) encoded string, not in a decimal format. So, you'll get a string of hexadecimal characters representing the block hash, rather than a decimal number.",
