    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to clean up my wallet and I've come across the `prunespentwallettransactions` command. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of the `prunespentwallettransactions` command is to remove spent transactions from the wallet, not to add new transactions. It can be used to clean up the wallet by removing transactions that are no longer relevant.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds useful. Before I run it, do I need to back up my wallet.dat file?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, it's highly recommended to back up your wallet.dat file before running the `prunespentwallettransactions` command. The command can modify your wallet, and losing your wallet.dat file could result in the loss of your VRSC funds. It's always better to be safe than sorry, so make sure to back up your wallet.dat file before running the command.",
