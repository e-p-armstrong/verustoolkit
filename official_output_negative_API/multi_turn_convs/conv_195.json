    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm playing around with the `getsaplingtree` command and I'm not entirely sure how it works. Can you tell me what it returns if no arguments are provided?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf no arguments are provided, the `getsaplingtree` command returns the Sapling tree state at the latest currency state and height. It's a pretty straightforward command, and it's useful for getting an idea of the current state of the Sapling tree.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. I was also wondering if I can use the `getsaplingtree` command to get the Sapling tree state for a specific block hash.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the `getsaplingtree` command doesn't accept a block hash as an argument. Instead, it allows you to retrieve the Sapling tree state at a specific height or range of heights by providing an optional height or inclusive range with an optional step as an argument.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question about the `getsaplingtree` command: what's the format of the result it returns?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `getsaplingtree` command is an array of objects, each containing information about the Sapling tree state at a specific height. The format of each object in the array is:\n```\n{\n  \"network\": \"VRSC\",\n  \"height\": n,\n  \"hash\": \"hex\",\n  \"time\": n,\n  \"tree\": \"hex\"\n}\n```\nSo, it's not a single string value, but rather an array of objects with this specific format. Does that help clarify things?",
