    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a question about using the `gettransaction` command. How do I use it to get information about a transaction that is not in my wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `gettransaction` command is actually designed to get detailed information about in-wallet transactions. Unfortunately, it doesn't provide information about transactions that are not in your wallet. If you need to look up a transaction that's not in your wallet, you might want to try using a blockchain explorer or another tool instead.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Another question about `gettransaction`: can I use it without specifying a transaction ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't use the `gettransaction` command without specifying a transaction ID. The `txid` argument is required, and it must be a string representing the transaction ID. So, you'll need to know the ID of the transaction you're interested in and include it in the command.",
