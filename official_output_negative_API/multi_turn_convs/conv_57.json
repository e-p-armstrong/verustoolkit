    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm working with transactions on Verus and I have a couple of questions about the fields. What is the format of the \"time\" field in a transaction, and what does it represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"time\" field in a transaction represents the transaction time in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970 GMT), not in a custom format. So, it's a standard Unix timestamp, but in seconds, not milliseconds.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. I was also wondering about the \"txid\" field. Is it only available for 'send' transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the \"txid\" field is available for both 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions, not just 'send' transactions. You should be able to access the \"txid\" field regardless of whether the transaction is a send or receive transaction.",
