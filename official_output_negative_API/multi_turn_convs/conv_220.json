    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with sending VRSC to an address. How do I send VRSC to an address without specifying an amount?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion here. You actually can't send VRSC to an address without specifying an amount. When using the `sendtoaddress` command, the amount is a required argument, and it must be a numeric value representing the amount of VRSC to send. So, you'll need to specify the amount you want to send along with the address. Does that make sense?",
