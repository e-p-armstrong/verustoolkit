    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to figure out how to use the `gettxoutproof` command to get the proof that a transaction was included in a specific block, but I don't want to maintain a transaction index or specify the block hash. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to use the `gettxoutproof` command without maintaining a transaction index or specifying the block hash. According to the documentation, the `gettxoutproof` command only works sometimes by default, which is when there is an unspent output in the UTXO for the transaction.\n\nTo make it always work, you need to maintain a transaction index using the `-txindex` command line option or specify the block in which the transaction is included in manually (by block hash). I know it might be a bit inconvenient, but it's a necessary step to ensure that the command works reliably.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
