    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get some information about my own node using the `getpeerinfo` command. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. The `getpeerinfo` command actually returns data about each connected network node, not about your own node. It returns a JSON array of objects, each containing information about a peer node, such as its address, services offered, and connection statistics. It's not meant to provide information about your own node.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. I was looking at the output of `getpeerinfo` and I saw a field called `bResult`. What's the purpose of that field?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is no `bResult` field in the `getpeerinfo` output. The output is a JSON array of objects, each representing a connected peer node, and containing various fields such as `id`, `addr`, `services`, and others. Maybe you're thinking of a different command or output?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, can I use `getpeerinfo` to get information about disconnected nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getpeerinfo` command only returns information about connected network nodes. It does not provide information about disconnected nodes. If you're looking for information about nodes that are not currently connected, you might need to use a different command or approach.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. I saw the `lastsend` and `lastrecv` fields in the `getpeerinfo` output. What's the unit of time for those fields?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe unit of time for the `lastsend` and `lastrecv` fields is seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT).",
