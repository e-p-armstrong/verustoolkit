    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a few questions about the `sendcurrency` command. I've noticed that it always returns the operation ID as public information. Is that correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not entirely correct. The operation ID is only not public information when `returntxtemplate` is set to `false`. If `returntxtemplate` is `true`, the output will include `outputtotals` and `hextx`, but not the operation ID. So, it's not always public information.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Another thing I've noticed is that the `sendcurrency` command can only be used with a single currency output. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The `sendcurrency` command can be used with multiple currency outputs. In the example provided, the command is shown with an array of objects, each specifying a currency, address, and amount. This allows for sending multiple currencies to different addresses in a single transaction.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. I've heard that the `sendcurrency` command can only be used through the command line interface and not through the JSON-RPC API. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The `sendcurrency` command can be used through both the command line interface and the JSON-RPC API. The example provided shows both a command line example and a JSON-RPC example using `curl`. So, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with either interface.",
