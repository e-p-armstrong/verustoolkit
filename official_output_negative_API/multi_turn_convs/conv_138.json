    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been using the `resendwallettransactions` command and I'm not entirely sure what it does. Can you explain its main purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to clarify! The `resendwallettransactions` command does not delete unconfirmed wallet transactions. Its main purpose is to immediately re-broadcast unconfirmed wallet transactions to all peers. This command is intended only for testing, as the wallet code periodically re-broadcasts automatically.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering, does the `resendwallettransactions` command return a boolean value indicating whether the re-broadcast was successful or not?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `resendwallettransactions` command returns an array of transaction IDs that were re-broadcast, not a boolean value indicating success or failure.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And one more question - is it recommended to use the `resendwallettransactions` command regularly in production environments to ensure timely transaction processing?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `resendwallettransactions` command is intended only for testing, not for regular use in production environments. The wallet code periodically re-broadcasts unconfirmed transactions automatically, so there is no need to use this command regularly. It's best to let the wallet handle the re-broadcasting of transactions on its own.",
