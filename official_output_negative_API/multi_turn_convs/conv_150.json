    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `listtransactions` command in Verus, but I'm not sure about the `account` argument. What is the default value of the `account` argument in the `listtransactions` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default value of the `account` argument in the `listtransactions` command is not specified. In fact, the `account` argument is optional, and it should be set to `\"*\"`.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps! I'm also trying to figure out how to include transactions to non-watchonly addresses using the `listtransactions` command. Do I need to do something special for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou don't need to do anything special to include transactions to non-watchonly addresses. The `includeWatchonly` argument is used to include transactions to watchonly addresses, so if you don't set it to `true`, the command will only return transactions to non-watchonly addresses.",
