    "How do I use the `sendmany` command to send a single transaction to multiple recipients, but only confirm the transaction after it has been confirmed at least 10 times on the blockchain?",
    "You can't set the confirmation to 10 times with the `sendmany` command. The `minconf` argument in the `sendmany` command specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for the balance to be used, not for the transaction to be confirmed. The default value is 1, which means the balance only needs to be confirmed once. You can set `minconf` to a higher value, but this will only affect the balance used in the transaction, not the confirmation of the transaction itself.",
