    "How do I use the `listbanned` command to ban a specific IP address?",
    "The `listbanned` command is used to list all banned IPs/Subnets, not to ban a specific IP address. It does not have the functionality to add new bans. The correct usage of `listbanned` is to retrieve a list of currently banned IPs/Subnets, as shown in the examples: `verus listbanned` or using the JSON-RPC method with `curl`.",
