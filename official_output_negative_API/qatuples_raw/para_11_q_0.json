    "How can I use the `zcrawjoinsplit` command to make transactions completely transparent?",
    "You can't. The `zcrawjoinsplit` command is actually used to create confidential transactions. The inputs are unilaterally confidential, and the outputs are confidential between the sender and receiver. Only the `vpub_old` and `vpub_new` values are globally public, and they are used to move transparent value into or out of the confidential value store.",
    "zcrawjoinsplit rawtx inputs outputs vpub_old vpub_new\n inputs: a JSON object mapping {note: zcsecretkey, ...}\n outputs: a JSON object mapping {zcaddr: value, ...}\n\nDEPRECATED. Splices a joinsplit into rawtx. Inputs are unilaterally confidential.\nOutputs are confidential between sender/receiver. The vpub_old and\nvpub_new values are globally public and move transparent value into\nor out of the confidential value store, respectively.\n\nNote: The caller is responsible for delivering the output enc1 and\nenc2 to the appropriate recipients, as well as signing rawtxout and\nensuring it is mined. (A future RPC call will deliver the confidential\npayments in-band on the blockchain.)\n\nOutput: {\n \"encryptednote1\": enc1,\n \"encryptednote2\": enc2,\n \"rawtxn\": rawtxout\n}",
