    "What is the purpose of the `migrate_converttoexport` command if it doesn't convert a raw transaction to a cross-chain export?",
    "Actually, the `migrate_converttoexport` command does convert a raw transaction to a cross-chain export. It takes in a raw transaction, a destination symbol, and an export amount as parameters, and returns the finished export transaction, along with the payouts. This export transaction can then be used to create an import transaction on a KMD node using the `migrate_createimporttransaction` method.",
    "migrate_converttoexport rawTx dest_symbol export_amount\n\nConvert a raw transaction to a cross-chain export.\nIf neccesary, the transaction should be funded using fundrawtransaction.\nFinally, the transaction should be signed using signrawtransaction\nThe finished export transaction, plus the payouts, should be passed to the \"migrate_createimporttransaction\" method on a KMD node to get the corresponding import transaction.",
