    "How do I use the `getcurrencybalance` command to send cryptocurrency to another address?",
    "The `getcurrencybalance` command is not used to send cryptocurrency to another address. It's actually used to retrieve the balance of a specific address in all currencies, belonging to the node's wallet. To send cryptocurrency, you would need to use a different command, such as `sendcurrency`.",
