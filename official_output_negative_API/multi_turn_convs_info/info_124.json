            "z_shieldcoinbase \"fromaddress\" \"tozaddress\" ( fee ) ( limit )THIS API IS DEPRECATED AND NON NECESSARY TO USE ON VERUS OR STANDARD PBAAS NETWORKS\nShield transparent coinbase funds by sending to a shielded zaddr. This is an asynchronous operation and utxos\nselected for shielding will be locked. If there is an error, they are unlocked. The RPC call `listlockunspent`\ncan be used to return a list of locked utxos. The number of coinbase utxos selected for shielding can be limited\nby the caller.
