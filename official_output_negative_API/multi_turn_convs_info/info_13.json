            "The `z_getbalance` command is not used to send VRSC to an address. Instead, it returns the balance of a taddr or zaddr belonging to the node's wallet. It takes two arguments: the address to check, and an optional minimum number of confirmations. The result is the total amount of VRSC received for that address.",
