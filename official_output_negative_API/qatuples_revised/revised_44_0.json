    "What is the command to estimate the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin confirmation within a certain number of minutes?",
    "The command is not estimating the fee per kilobyte based on minutes, but rather based on the number of blocks. The correct command is `estimatefee nblocks`, where `nblocks` is the number of blocks. This command estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin confirmation within `nblocks` blocks.",
