    "Can you explain why the `listunspent` command doesn't return any transaction outputs with less than 100 confirmations?",
    "The `listunspent` command actually returns transaction outputs with between `minconf` and `maxconf` confirmations, inclusive. By default, `minconf` is 1, which means it will return transaction outputs with at least 1 confirmation. If you want to filter out transaction outputs with less than 100 confirmations, you can specify `minconf` as 100.",
