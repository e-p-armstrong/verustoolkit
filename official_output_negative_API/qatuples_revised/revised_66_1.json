    "Can I use the `zcrawjoinsplit` command to create transactions without any confidential information?",
    "No, you can't. The `zcrawjoinsplit` command is specifically designed to create transactions with confidential information. It's used to splice a joinsplit into a raw transaction, and the inputs and outputs are designed to be confidential. If you need to create a transaction without confidential information, you would need to use a different command or method.",
    "zcrawjoinsplit rawtx inputs outputs vpub_old vpub_new\n inputs: a JSON object mapping {note: zcsecretkey, ...}\n outputs: a JSON object mapping {zcaddr: value, ...}\n\nDEPRECATED. Splices a joinsplit into rawtx. Inputs are unilaterally confidential.\nOutputs are confidential between sender/receiver. The vpub_old and\nvpub_new values are globally public and move transparent value into\nor out of the confidential value store, respectively.\n\nNote: The caller is responsible for delivering the output enc1 and\nenc2 to the appropriate recipients, as well as signing rawtxout and\nensuring it is mined. (A future RPC call will deliver the confidential\npayments in-band on the blockchain.)\n\nOutput: {\n \"encryptednote1\": enc1,\n \"encryptednote2\": enc2,\n \"rawtxn\": rawtxout\n}",
