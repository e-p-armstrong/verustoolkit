    "The \"randomSeed\" field is not used to generate the proof. Its purpose is not clearly specified in the provided information, but it is likely used as a random seed for some cryptographic operation, such as key generation or encryption. The \"proof\" field in the JSON object contains a hexadecimal representation of a zero-knowledge proof, which is a separate entity from the \"randomSeed\".",
