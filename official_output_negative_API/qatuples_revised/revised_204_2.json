    "How does the `getblockchaininfo` command show the progress of a hardfork in the blockchain?",
    "The `getblockchaininfo` command does not show the progress of a hardfork in the blockchain. It shows the status of softforks in progress, including the name of the softfork, block version, enforcement progress, and rejection progress. Hardforks are not mentioned in the command's output.",
