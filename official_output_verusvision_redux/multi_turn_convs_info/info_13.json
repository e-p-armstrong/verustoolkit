            "The purpose of the Verus vision paper is to communicate the vision, plans, and thinking behind Verus, rather than serving as a technical reference. To provide more detailed information, the vision paper will be supplemented with white papers, which will describe the new technologies developed for Verus, their benefits, and implementation details. These white papers will be released as each phase of Verus's development is completed.",

To supplement this vision paper, we\nwill follow soon after its initial release with a white paper, describing the new technologies\ndeveloped for Verus Coin\u2019s initial launch, what benefits they provide, and provide details of\ntheir implementation.

            "What has been accomplished in Phase 1 of Verus's development?",
            "In Phase 1 of Verus's development, Verus Coin has been released with several key features, including zero-knowledge privacy, a combination of CPU-mineable proof of work (POW) and fair proof of stake (POS) consensus, in-wallet mining and staking on PCs, and support for advanced Komodo platform technologies. Wallets and miners are available for every major PC operating system.",

            "Verus aims to address the lack of online privacy and the exploitation of this weakness by companies and individuals who try to influence our behavior and extract value from us. This is often done through targeted advertising and manipulation of information, which can affect our behavior and decisions. Verus seeks to provide a solution to this problem by offering zero-knowledge privacy and other features that promote online privacy and security.",
