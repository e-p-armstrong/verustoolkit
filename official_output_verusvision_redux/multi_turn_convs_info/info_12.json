            "What were some of the major security flaws in previous electronic voting systems that affected the legitimacy of election results?",
            "Previous electronic voting systems had several major security flaws that affected the legitimacy of election results. One of the main issues was the use of a single personal voting 'martcard' that did not contain a complete identity, but instead contained a common election key among voters. This lack of cryptographic unique identification on the cards made it easy to mass produce homemade copies. Additionally, the system had numerous potential attack vectors due to the lack of a secure boot loader, operating system, or application, making it easy for attackers to modify ballot program files.",
