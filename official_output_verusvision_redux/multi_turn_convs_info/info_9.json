            "How do lotteries work on the Verus network, and how can I participate in one?",
            "On the Verus network, lotteries are decentralized, meaning there is no central server selecting and sending messages to participants. To participate in a lottery, you must first determine if you meet the requirements, then submit a transaction that proves your valid claim. This transaction will spend the output of the lottery ticket to your address, authorizing you to be a validator on the autochain for the poll you're participating in. You can then validate the poll by running your wallet and potentially earn rewards in Verus or Virtue.",
            "Since the Verus network is completely decentralized, all lotteries, including PoS, are potential,\nand there is no central server selecting and sending messages to those who qualified in a\nlottery. When lotteries are implemented as a general feature, if you would like to participate\nin any Verus lottery or poll that is distributing tickets via lottery, you must first determine\nthat you qualify for the poll\u2019s requirements. You will then need to submit a transaction that\nproves that you have a valid claim and spend the output transaction of the lottery ticket to\nyour address using that proof. By default, that spend will authorize you to be a validator\non the autochain for the poll you are participating in, by providing you with the currency\nof that poll. You may validate the poll by leaving your wallet running, getting potential\nrewards in Verus or Virtue for both activities.\nLotteries will be useful for selecting subpopulations based on identity and claims people\nmake about themselves or that others claim about them, which they are willing to share.\nWhile detailed discussion of Verus identity is beyond the scope of this paper\u2019s release, the\nVerus system will provide self-sovereign identity with the ability for identities to make very\nflexible claims and have them attested to by other identities. For example, a lottery may look\nfor males between the ages of 18 to 25 among identities willing to share that information,\nwhich will even be possible to verify as strongly as through a validated passport or driver\u2019s\nlicense. Other polls may not require the same evidence backing claims. Polls may also have\nrestricted voting, such as local political polls, where verification and authorization for the\npoll must be provided explicitly, often by mail to a physical address or in person in the form\nof a QR code or electronically delivered transaction to your Verus wallet.163.4.2",

            "What are some potential use cases for lotteries on the Verus network?",
            "Lotteries on the Verus network can be used to select subpopulations based on identity and claims people make about themselves or that others claim about them. For example, a lottery might look for individuals within a specific age range or demographic who are willing to share that information. This can even be verified with strong evidence, similar to a validated passport or driver's license. Other polls may have different requirements or restrictions, such as local political polls that require explicit verification and authorization.",
