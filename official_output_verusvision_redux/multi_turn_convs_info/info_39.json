            "What is the purpose of jl777's 1 Bitcoin bounty for a GPU miner for the VerusHash algorithm?",
            "The purpose of the bounty is to encourage the development of an open-source GPU miner for the VerusHash algorithm that can significantly outperform the current CPU miner. This will help ensure that the solution remains open and benefits the Verus community.",
            "To ensure that such a solution if developed, remains open, jl777, lead developer of the\nKomodo Platform, has offered a 1 Bitcoin bounty to any developer who can make and\npublish in an open manner, a GPU miner for the VerusHash algorithm that can significantly\noutperform the current CPU miner. In order to win the bounty, the source code for the\nminer must be available under open source licensing. To be eligible for the bounty, any\nimplementation must be able to perform 5x better than a modern, high thread-count, high\nclock-rate CPU on a GPU costing under $1000.
