            "Why is it important to create a system that is truly confidential, verifiable, and transparent, especially in the context of voting and polling?",
            "It is crucial to create a system that is truly confidential, verifiable, and transparent because it has the potential to significantly impact world politics. Ensuring the integrity of voting systems is vital, and a system that lacks confidentiality, verifiability, and transparency can be vulnerable to manipulation and fraud. Verus aims to address this problem by creating a secure and trustworthy platform for voting and polling.",

            "How does Verus plan to improve the security and scalability of polls using autochains?",
            "Verus plans to improve the security and scalability of polls by dynamically creating parallel voting chains on demand for each poll in its ecosystem using autochains. This approach creates improved, isolated security and allows for scaling in a virtually unlimited manner. Each poll will have its own dedicated chain, which can be archived or deleted once the poll is complete, and the results are posted back to the main Verus chain.",
