            "How does Verus's proof of stake lottery system work?",
            "Verus's proof of stake lottery system is a mechanism that allows users to claim the right to validate a block and its associated reward based on proof-of-stake (for autochains) or 50/50 PoW/PoS (for the main chain). To participate in the lottery, a user must have a qualifying UTXO (unspent transaction output) that meets certain conditions. Specifically, the prior block hash 100 blocks past combined with the qualifying UTXO of the destination public key hashed with the staking block height and then divided by the UTXO value must be under the current proof of stake validation difficulty. This system weights proof-of-stake or proof-of-virtue in proportion to the amount of stake or virtue in the UTXO.",

The\nmanual ways emphasized so far may include receiving a poll with QR code in post or email\nor perhaps directly from someone taking a poll.

This will work when the Verus\nID functionality is available, and will enable polls to require presence of specific claims or\nattestations on an ID, as well as the number of participants to select in the poll by creating\none transaction output for each, which is spendable by a cryptocondition [17] that defines\nthe lottery conditions and random difficulty.
