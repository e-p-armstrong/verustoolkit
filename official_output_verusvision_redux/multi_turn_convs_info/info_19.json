            "What is the key difference between fact and opinion, and how does it relate to classifying content in the context of Verus?",
            "The key difference between fact and opinion is that facts are objective and can be verified, while opinions are subjective and based on personal beliefs. In the context of Verus, this distinction is important when classifying content, as it determines how polls are conducted and how voters are rewarded. For example, determining the factual answer to a question, such as whether an image is the same in two photos, is an objective task, whereas selecting the winner of an election is a matter of expressing an opinion.",
            "When classifying content, especially when you start to consider challenging classifications,\nsuch as misleading, propaganda, generally accepted fact, accurate versions of history, vs.\nclassification of what should generally be accepted as toxic or rated content that people could\nreasonably answer objectively, one must consider the difference between fact and opinion.\nSelecting the winner of an election is a matter of expressing an opinion. Classifying content\naccording to level of toxicity is a question of determining the factual answer to the question:\nwhat does the majority of the voting population believe the classification to be. Determining15whether an image in one photo is the same image as that from another is a question with\nan objective, if not determinable answer.\nTo ensure that Verus polls support polls that attempt to discover accepted truths, facts,\nand even credible emerging arguments, Verus voters will often be able to stake and either\nearn or lose Verus and in later phases, Virtue, by answering in a manner that matches\nconsensus. For other polls, which are recognized as opinion polls, all answers are equally\nvalid contributions.3.4Random Sampling as a Service",

            "How do Verus polls support the discovery of accepted truths, facts, and emerging arguments?",
            "Verus polls support the discovery of accepted truths, facts, and emerging arguments by allowing voters to stake and earn or lose Verus (and later, Virtue) by answering in a manner that matches the consensus. This incentivizes voters to provide accurate and informed responses, which helps to establish a collective understanding of the truth.",

            "How do Verus polls handle opinion-based questions, and what is the value of these types of polls?",
            "Verus polls handle opinion-based questions by recognizing them as opinion polls, where all answers are equally valid contributions. The value of these types of polls lies in their ability to gather diverse perspectives and opinions, which can provide valuable insights and facilitate discussions.",
