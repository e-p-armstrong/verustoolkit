    "What is the purpose of the accelerated reward curve for mining and staking during the first 5 months of Verus's operation?",
    "The accelerated reward curve during the first 5 months is designed to contribute to a more stable value growth in the Verus currency, without any unusual risk of dumping by any single party. It incentivizes miners and stakers to support the long-term success of the Verus network and project.",
    "chedule is as follows:\nEra 1:\nBlock 0 - 10080 reward: 0 to 384, rising linearly and changing each block\nEra 2:\nBlock 10080 - 53279 reward: 384\nBlock 53280 - 96479 reward: 192\nBlock 96480 - 139679 reward: 96\nBlock 139680 - 182879 reward: 48\nBlock 182880 - 226079 reward: 24\nEra 3:\nBlock 226080 - 1277279 reward: 24\nBlock 1277280 - 2328479 reward: 12\nBlock 2328480 - 3379679 reward: 6\n. . . halving indefinitely every 1051200 blocks (approximately 2 years)\nWe also added another fair twist on the launch that we believe will contribute to a more\nstable value growth in the Verus currency, without any unusual risk of dumping by any single\nparty. During the first 5 months, Verus will have an accelerated reward curve for mining\nand staking, with a halving every month. During the first two months, when the block\nrewards are at or above 192 Verus, mined blocks will have time locked coinbase transactions,\npreventing spending, staking, or transferring of those coins for a period that varies from\napproximately 3 months after the genesis block, based on numbers of blocks, to 2 years and\n3 months. These time locked coins provide a smooth release of the Verus currency supply as\nwell as incentive to all of their owners to support the long term success of the Verus network\nand project.\nFrom the very beginning of its operation, Verus operated with a dual proof of stake /\nproof of work mechanism for all participants. Verus mining with the VerusHash algorithm,\nas of this point, is a CPU-only algorithm, designed with a Haraka512 V2 [30] core to be\nquantum secure and to maximize performance on modern CPUs. While VerusHash was\ndesigned to be CPU-optimized and did not begin life with GPU or ASIC miners capable of\nbeating CPUs in its mining, the Verus developers have no illusions that it is possible someone\nmight develop either a GPU or ASIC-based miner that could be meaningfully superior to\nCPUs.",
