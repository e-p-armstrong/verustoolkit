    "How is Virtue earned and what is its purpose in the Verus Network?",
    "Virtue is earned by Verus holders through activities that benefit the network, such as staking, attesting to facts, validating information, or providing other measurable benefits. Its purpose is to incentivize correct behavior and drive positive actions within the network. Virtue is not purchasable or sellable, and its intrinsic value is recognized within the Verus ecosystem.",
    "Using a model similar to the EigenTrust algorithm, Verus will introduce the idea of Proof of\nVirtue (PoV) enhancement to the PoS algorithm initially released in Phase I. In PoV, we\nintend to weight staking contests with both Verus stake and \u201cVirtue\u201d, a special \u201ccurrency\u201d,\nexpected to be tracked on a Virtue autochain, and used as a trust rating of identities within\nthe network.\nIn a similar way to the \u201camount of stake\u201d used when staking, Virtue will add another\ncomponent to the probability of being selected to process a block of transactions on the\nVerus Network. Its probabilities upon introduction will not change returns on the Verus PoS\nsystem, but addresses will gradually be able to improve earnings with a Virtue weighting \u2013\nbased on recorded activity and behavior.\nIn order to ensure that Virtue is both a rare and valued property, which drives correct\nbehavior, it will neither be purchased, nor sold. Verus holders will have opportunities to\nearn a small measure of Virtue, which can then be further increased by staking the Virtue\nitself, when attesting to a fact for the network, validating information, or providing another\nmeasurable benefit to the network.\nSince Virtue will have intrinsic value on the Verus network, there will be methods for\ntransferring it through wallet ownership \u2013 for cases of probate or other necessity \u2013 but such\nbehavior as a tool for trading in virtue will not provide a secure or intended method of\n11",
