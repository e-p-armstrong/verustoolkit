    "How will validation work for Verus poll applications?",
    "For Verus poll applications, validation will default to a form of proof-of-stake (PoS), where all members of the chain are stakers. This security model is chosen because it matches the requirements of these applications.",
    "rooted in a primary value\nchain.\nAutochains are exactly what they sound like \u2013 automatically instantiated blockchains\nthat are validated initially \u2013 and when notarizing \u2013 by Verus miners, and otherwise, only by\ntheir users, often a disjoin set from the whole of Verus users. Autochains, once instantiated,\ncan be used indefinitely or can have a finite lifetime to be used for a specific purpose. In\nthis document, we will often discuss autochains in the context of a few concrete applications\nthat we intend to implement on the Verus network. It is important to keep in mind that\ntheir versatility is basically unlimited. Due to their security being inherited from the main\nVerus chain, autochains eliminate perhaps the biggest disadvantage that creating consensusbased distributed ledger applications suffers from: Weak defense against attacks in their\nearliest stages.\nIn Phase II, Verus will define an autochain provisioning protocol, and specific voting\nprotocols, based on blockchain transactions. These protocols will include zero knowledge\nproofs, Crypto Conditions [17], and Interledger Protocol [25] technologies to provide proper\nincentive for all participants to engage in the automatic creation and use of on-demand,\nisolated or public blockchains, ones that rest on a secure, public foundation.\nThe autochain protocol will also provide the ability to place a value on the data generated\nby the autochain\u2019s operation. This value will then either be released to the public or paid\nout, through rewards, to the participants in the creation of that data. This creates a model\nthat incentivizes release of learning and information to the public \u2013 also making applications\nwhich do so much less expensive to run.\nFor Verus poll applications, validation will default to a form of proof-of-stake (PoS),\nwhere all members of the chain are stakers. This is because that security model matches\nexac",
