    "How can improving the recognition of trustworthy participants in a blockchain system lead to increased security and reduced ecological cost?",
    "Improving the recognition of trustworthy participants in a blockchain system can lead to increased security and reduced ecological cost by allowing the system to determine who participates in the validation process. This can be achieved by using accurate statistical functions to predict the probability of a participant being byzantine or rational. By identifying trustworthy participants, the system can decrease the power consumption and ecological cost of blockchain security while further strengthening resistance to attack.",
    "t if there was a way to learn a more accurate statistical function for each participant\u2019s probability of being either byzantine or rational, using such a function to determine\nwho participates in the system\u2019s validation would improve its resistance to attack.\nIn fact, any accurate method of recognizing those who were attempting to strengthen\nthe system \u2013 and thus who could statistically be more trusted than a byzantine or even\naverage participant \u2013 could both decrease the power consumption and ecological cost of\nblockchain security and further strengthen resistance to attack. This then brings up the\nquestion: \u201cHow do we recognize trustworthy participants?\u201d\nSome methods studied and proven effective are the Eigentrust reputation management\nalgorithm [20], and its improved derivative the Eigentrust++ mechanism implemented in the\nNEM blockchain [22]. Originally designed by Sep Kamvar, Mario Glosser and Hector GarciaMolina in 2003, the Eigentrust algorithm is built to function on peer-to-peer networks. It\naims to isolate byzantine actors in said networks by assigning each peer a public, global trust\nvalue based on their history of activity \u2013 clearly displaying a form of \u201crating\u201d for each peer.\nThose with lower ratings are shown not to be trustworthy, and thus, are interacted with less\nby their peers.\nSimply put, the algorithm assumes that if any given peer a trusts any given peer b,\nthen it would also trust the peers trusted by b. Every peer calculates a local trust value\nfor each other peer it has interacted with, based on the either satisfactory or unsatisfactory\ntransactions it has had with each one. These local trust values are determined by each peer,\nand when peer a wants to know if they should trust peer b, say, before making a transaction,\npeer a would ask all other peers it knows to report on their local trust values of peer b and\nweigh their responses according t",
