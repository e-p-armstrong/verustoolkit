    "What were some of the major security flaws in previous electronic voting systems that affected the legitimacy of election results?",
    "Previous electronic voting systems had several major security flaws that affected the legitimacy of election results. One of the main issues was the use of a single personal voting 'martcard' that did not contain a complete identity, but instead contained a common election key among voters. This lack of cryptographic unique identification on the cards made it easy to mass produce homemade copies. Additionally, the system had numerous potential attack vectors due to the lack of a secure boot loader, operating system, or application, making it easy for attackers to modify ballot program files.",

This smartcard, unfortunately, did not contain a complete\nidentity, but instead contained a common election key among voters that voting machines\nsimply checked to determine if the card belonged in the correct election [2]. The lack of\nany cryptographic unique identification on these cards was a significant security flaw, as\nuser-programmable smart cards and readers almost instantly became commercially available\non the internet for reasonable prices \u2013 making it extremely easy to mass produce homemade\ncopies. Furthermore, due to the lack of a truly secure boot loader, operating system, or application, the system had numerous potential attack vectors, many of which were quite simple\nfor an adversary. For example, any attacker with access to the operating system had the\nability to modify ballot program files through the standard Windows Explorer application\nalready included on each machine.\nThese serious failures in previously adopted electronic voting systems have literally\nchanged the course of history, affecting the outcomes of major political elections that\n12",
