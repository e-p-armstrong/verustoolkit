    "How does the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism used in Verus's autochains contribute to their security and scalability?",
    "The PoS consensus mechanism in Verus's autochains allows voters to secure the chain by simply running the voting software, without the need for powerful mining equipment or competition to solve cryptographic puzzles. This means that autochains can operate on less powerful hardware, even mobile devices, and are generally not affected by activity on the main Verus chain. Additionally, the operation of an autochain adds no overhead or congestion to the main Verus chain's transaction load, except for the transactions to provision the poll chain and post results back to the main chain.",
    "tly the interests of the majority of voters in having an accurate record. Because PoS does\nnot involve powerful mining equipment or competition to solve a cryptographic puzzle, it can\noperate on much less powerful hardware\u2013 even on mobile devices. Since voters, themselves,\nsecure the chain simply by running the voting software, poll chains are generally not affected\nby activity on the main Verus chain (except when posting interledger transactions). In\naddition, an autochain\u2019s operation, independent of scale, adds no overhead or congestion to\nthe main Verus chain\u2019s transaction load \u2013 besides the transactions to provision the poll chain\nand post results back to the main chain itself.\nSince we want to be able to create autochains from clients that may not be running full\nnodes or even own stable IP addresses, full nodes will be incentivized to provide reliable\nstatic node support for autochains. Once they provide this support, they will be recognized\n8",
