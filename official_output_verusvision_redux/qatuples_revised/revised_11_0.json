    "What is the approach of Verus towards developing its technology, and how does it plan to collaborate with other projects?",
    "Verus aims to build upon a foundation of state-of-the-art privacy, security, and interledger transaction capabilities. To achieve this, it will maintain an open-source fork of the Komodo platform and collaborate with the Komodo team when possible to develop new features or capabilities that can be accessed cross-chain by projects across the Komodo platform and other compatible blockchains. Verus will also contribute back to the broader open-source community, leveraging the contributions of others to realize its vision.",

Above that, we have already developed advanced features that further enhance\nsecurity, improve decentralization, and prepare for the implementation of autochains and\nproof of virtue.\nWe will maintain our own open source fork of the Komodo platform and collaborate with\nthe Komodo team when possible to develop new features or capabilities that can be accessed\ncross-chain by projects across the Komodo platform and even other blockchains that are\nsimply compatible with Komodo\u2019s Interledger Protocol implementations. We will maintain\nour development as an open source project and contribute back to the broader open source\ncommunity, as we leverage the contributions of others that have made it possible for us to\nbegin realizing our vision as a community.\nAll that said, roadmaps are never perfect. Unless we significantly underpromise and\nprioritize a date so highly that no feature or capability is important in and of itself, targeting\ntimeframes and milestones without specific target dates allows us to be ambitious in our goals\nand adapt to a changing world as we deliver. Even in Phase I, which we have delivered as\nof the writing of this paper, we adjusted our plan, and in an uncharacteristic turn of events,\ndelivered even more than we had originally planned. We do not expect that to always\nbe the case, and we will focus more on correct and complete phases than specific dates\nwhen possible.
