    "How does Verus plan to integrate with IPFS for off-chain content storage and retrieval?",
    "Verus applications will assume that off-chain content should be retrieved from IPFS. To ensure content availability, content owners must pin the content in IPFS until it is no longer needed. Additionally, a storage and version specifier will be added for future compatibility.",
    ", non-repudiable records and public key management, they are not the best solution for storing large amounts of data, due\nto their massive duplication across the distributed network. Instead, a better model for distributed storage would look something like the Interplanetary File System, or IPFS, which\nis a peer-to-peer file system based on the Kademlia [18]19 protocol in an implementation\nthat currently works well enough to use as storage for create/read/delete operations using\nhash commitments on the Verus blockchain to represent and index content.\nWhile we are evaluating the IPFS, we are also looking at other distributed hash table\nsolutions, such as Open DHT [26]. A key requirement for the Verus network is that mobile\ndevices be able to participate in its operation. Open DHT is an efficient C++ library intended\nfor use with small devices. IPFS does not yet seem to have much support for mobile at this\ntime, though it does have a Javascript library that can be used from the browser or mobile\napcancations [24].\nUntil IPFS is supplanted with another implementation, Verus applications will assume\nthat when off-chain content is needed, it should be retrieved from IPFS, and for future\ncompatibility, we will add a storage and version specifier. In order to store supporting poll\nor other content for dApps, the content owner must ensure that the content is pinned in\nIPFS, until it is no longer needed. By Phase IV, or earlier if there is significant demand,\nwe expect to either support or provide a blockchain-metered storage solution that is more\nintegrated and automatic to use for poll makers. Two options for such a system include\na cross-blockchain integration with a decentralized payment/pinning solution, or to offer\na simple service that charges in Verus to store and automatically pin content for specific\nlengths of time in IPFS.\n3.3.4",
