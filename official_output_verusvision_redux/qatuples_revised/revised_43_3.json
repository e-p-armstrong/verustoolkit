    "decide the state of world politics. This highlights the importance of creating a system that\nis truly confidential, verifiable and transparent, and indicates the magnitude of one problem\nwe plan to solve with Verus.\n3.3.2Running, Recording, and Scaling Polls - Transient, PoS ChainsUsing autochains, Verus will dynamically create parallel voting chains on demand for each\npoll in its ecosystem. This creates improved, isolated security and allows for scaling in a\nvirtually unlimited manner.\nThe Verus wallet, which will be used for voting, will also have the ability to validate blocks\nthrough proof-of-stake, blocks which, when enabled, will allow voters who are validating the\nelection to earn rewards. These rewards will either be paid in Virtue for intrinsic polls, when\navailable, or from outputs of the payment transaction that instantiated the poll. When a\npoll is complete, results are posted back to the main Verus chain. The chain used to run it\ncan then be archived or deleted, and it is typically abandoned.\n3.3.3Poll Content and Distributed Hash TablesWhile blockchains make excellent databases for permanent",
