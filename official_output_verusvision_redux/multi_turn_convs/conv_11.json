    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about how Verus handles different types of content, and I was wondering, what's the key difference between fact and opinion, and how does it relate to classifying content in the context of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe key difference between fact and opinion is that facts are objective and can be verified, while opinions are subjective and based on personal beliefs. In the context of Verus, this distinction is important when classifying content, as it determines how polls are conducted and how voters are rewarded. For example, determining the factual answer to a question, such as whether an image is the same in two photos, is an objective task, whereas selecting the winner of an election is a matter of expressing an opinion. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. How do Verus polls support the discovery of accepted truths, facts, and emerging arguments?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus polls support the discovery of accepted truths, facts, and emerging arguments by allowing voters to stake and earn or lose Verus (and later, Virtue) by answering in a manner that matches the consensus. This incentivizes voters to provide accurate and informed responses, which helps to establish a collective understanding of the truth. By aligning the economic incentives with the truth, Verus polls can help to uncover widely accepted facts and emerging arguments. Do you have any more questions about how Verus polls work?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How do Verus polls handle opinion-based questions, and what's the value of these types of polls?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus polls handle opinion-based questions by recognizing them as opinion polls, where all answers are equally valid contributions. The value of these types of polls lies in their ability to gather diverse perspectives and opinions, which can provide valuable insights and facilitate discussions. By allowing individuals to express their opinions and engage with others, Verus opinion polls can foster a sense of community and help to identify emerging trends and sentiments. Do you have any more questions about Verus or its vision for facilitating discovery and discussion?",
