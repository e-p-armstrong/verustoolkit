    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to run `./verusd` on my Linux distribution, but I'm getting some errors. Do you know what causes the errors \"error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory\" and \"error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThose errors are usually caused by the required dependencies not being installed by default on a Linux distribution. Specifically, the `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries are missing.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I resolve these errors? I'm not familiar with installing dependencies on Linux.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo resolve these errors, you need to install the `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries. This can be done by running the command `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`. Once you've installed these dependencies, you should be able to run `./verusd` without any issues.",
