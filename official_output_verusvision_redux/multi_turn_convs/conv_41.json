    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about the potential implications of a decentralized network like Verus, and I'm curious about how you plan to handle harmful or unwanted content on the network. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus recognizes that a system without censorship may allow harmful or unwanted content to exist on its network. To address this, Verus plans to use its poll system to recognize, rate, and classify content, enabling participants to earn rewards for their contributions. This approach allows for selective filtering of content based on value judgments and classification of honest populations. This system is envisioned to start with simple tasks, such as identifying toxic comments or hate speech, and will increasingly develop over time to tackle more complex classification tasks.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I'm also curious about how this approach differs from traditional ways of handling content classification. Can you explain more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe goal of Verus's content classification system is to enable people to earn rewards by accurately classifying content, which can then be followed and generalized by machine learning algorithms at scale. This approach differs from traditional machine learning-based approaches, which rely on privately curated training data, by leveraging the collective wisdom of human participants to classify content more effectively.",
