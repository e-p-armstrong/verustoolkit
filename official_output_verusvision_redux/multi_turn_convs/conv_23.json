    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still trying to understand Verus better. How does Verus ensure the privacy and security of identities on its platform?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus ensures the privacy and security of identities on its platform by assigning each identity a unique address. This makes it cryptographically hard, or virtually impossible, to correlate one identity to another without the owner revealing information that links them. This provides a strong layer of protection for users' identities and personal information.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know. But how can the owner of an identity on Verus verify statements made about their identities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe owner of an identity on Verus can cryptographically verify statements made about their identities under their control, attesting to identity properties such as passport, age, height, citizenship, photo, and more. This verification is as strong as is possible with today's digital technology. This means that users can confidently prove their identity and attributes without relying on third-party intermediaries or compromising their privacy.",
