    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the mobile experience of Verus. What kind of mobile support does Verus plan to provide for its users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus plans to provide a mobile experience that functions as a wallet, self-sovereign identity, and an extensible application browser, allowing users to use, earn, and spend Verus in their daily lives. The mobile experience will also provide easy access to polling and earning applications. This will make it easy for users to manage their Verus assets and participate in the ecosystem on-the-go.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! Are there any features that the initial mobile experience will lack?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the initial mobile experience of Verus will not include support for private transactions, which are intended to be enabled as a foundation for confidential, mobile polling and communications. But don't worry, this is just the starting point, and more features will be added over time.\n\n**User:**\nI see. How does Verus plan to achieve its goals in terms of technology and development?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus plans to achieve its goals by building on top of the Komodo platform and its asset chain technology, leveraging proven zk-SNARK zero-knowledge privacy technologies and Komodo's delayed proof of work (dPoW) to underpin Verus with a foundation of security and scalability. By building on top of Komodo's technology, Verus can focus on developing its unique features and applications.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What is the significance of Komodo's delayed proof of work (dPoW) in the context of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nKomodo's delayed proof of work (dPoW) notarizes the main Verus blockchain into Komodo's blockchain, which is then notarized into the Bitcoin blockchain, providing an additional layer of security and scalability to Verus. This means that Verus benefits from the security of not one, but two, established blockchain networks, making it an even more robust and reliable platform.",
