    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in the Verus Project's vision for a better society through public blockchain services. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Project's vision is built on three fundamental pillars. These pillars are: extreme transaction throughput and scalable decentralized applications with autochains, which provide public blockchains as a service (PBaaS); selectively strong, private identity; and open application support with a foundation of polls, voting, and lottery selection services.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What is the ultimate goal of these three pillars working together?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe ultimate goal of these three pillars working together is to enable direct querying with confidential and truthful answers across an entire population, creating a secure, public platform that respects privacy and potentially serves as the foundation of a more respectful society.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard the term \"Verus Virtue\" thrown around. Can you explain what it is and how it relates to the Verus proof-of-stake algorithm?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Virtue can be thought of as a separate currency that can be earned, but not purchased or sold. It is part of the evolution of the Verus proof-of-stake algorithm, which will be implemented in later phases of the Verus project.",
