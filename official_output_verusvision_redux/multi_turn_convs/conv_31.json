    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been doing some research on Verus and I'm curious about the block reward schedule. Can you explain it to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe block reward schedule for Verus is divided into Eras. In Era 1, the block reward rises linearly from 0 to 384 over the first 10,080 blocks. In Era 2, the block reward remains constant at 384 for a period, then halves every 26,400 blocks (approximately 6 months) to 192, 96, 48, and 24. In Era 3, the block reward continues to halve indefinitely every 1,051,200 blocks (approximately 2 years) to 12, 6, and so on.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also heard that there's an accelerated reward curve for mining and staking during the first 5 months of Verus's operation. What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe accelerated reward curve during the first 5 months is designed to contribute to a more stable value growth in the Verus currency, without any unusual risk of dumping by any single party. It incentivizes miners and stakers to support the long-term success of the Verus network and project.\n\n**User:**\nAnother thing I've come across is time-locked coinbase transactions during the first two months of Verus's operation. What's the purpose of those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe time-locked coinbase transactions during the first two months are designed to provide a smooth release of the Verus currency supply, as well as an incentive to all coin holders to support the long-term success of the Verus network and project. These transactions prevent spending, staking, or transferring of the coins for a period that varies from approximately 3 months after the genesis block to 2 years and 3 months.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I've heard about the VerusHash algorithm. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusHash algorithm is a CPU-only algorithm designed to be quantum secure and maximize performance on modern CPUs. It was designed to be CPU-optimized, but the Verus developers recognize that it is possible for someone to develop a GPU or ASIC-based miner that could be superior to CPUs in the future.",
