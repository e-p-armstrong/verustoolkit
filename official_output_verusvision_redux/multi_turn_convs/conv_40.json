    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the autochain on Verus, and I'm curious about how nodes get selected for validation. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNodes on the autochain get selected for validation through a random lottery. To participate in this lottery, nodes need to advertise their support for the autochain on the main blockchain along with a stable payment address via a transaction. This ensures that only nodes that are committed to supporting the autochain are eligible for selection.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But what's the purpose of this selection process? Is it just random or is there a reason behind it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of this selection is to allow nodes that consistently offer better Quality of Service (QoS) to get better ratings and increase their chances of being selected in future lotteries. This incentivizes nodes to perform well and provide a high level of service to the network.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of Eigentrust ratings being mentioned in relation to the autochain. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEigentrust ratings are used to record the performance of nodes on the autochain. Nodes that consistently offer better QoS will get better ratings, while nodes that get poorly rated will be less likely to be selected in the next node lottery. However, even poorly rated nodes will still share in the node rewards for the current blockchain. This system helps to ensure that nodes are accountable for their performance and are rewarded or penalized accordingly.",
