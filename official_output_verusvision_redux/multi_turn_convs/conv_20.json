    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about Verus and its plans for voting and polls. Can you tell me more about what types of polls and voting systems Verus plans to support?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus aims to support a wide range of poll and voting systems, including multiple choice, weighted multiple choice, ranking, and rating. Additionally, it will support different types of polls, such as those for classification, selection, ranking, and rating. This will allow for a high degree of flexibility and customization when creating polls and voting systems.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds impressive. Will all of these voting and poll types be supported from the start?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not all voting and poll types will be supported from the start. Initially, the Verus core team will focus on supporting multiple choice and weighted multiple choice voting, with plans to expand support for other types of voting and polls in the future. This will allow us to ensure a solid foundation for our initial rollout and then build upon it.\n\n**User:**\nWhat features will Verus polls support?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus polls will support various features, including confidential or public voting, live or delayed poll results, online or offline vote authorization, and lottery-selected vote authorization. These features will provide a high degree of customization and flexibility for poll creators, as well as ensure the integrity and security of the voting process.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the focus of the initial rollout of Verus polls?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe initial rollout of Verus polls will focus on providing solutions for weighted and unweighted selection voting, which is suitable for both political and opinion polls, as well as content classification and ID verification.
