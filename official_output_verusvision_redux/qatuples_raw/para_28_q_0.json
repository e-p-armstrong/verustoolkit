    "Why is it important to create a system that is truly confidential, verifiable, and transparent, especially in the context of voting and polling?",
    "It is crucial to create a system that is truly confidential, verifiable, and transparent because it has the potential to significantly impact world politics. Ensuring the integrity of voting systems is vital, and a system that lacks confidentiality, verifiability, and transparency can be vulnerable to manipulation and fraud. Verus aims to address this problem by creating a secure and trustworthy platform for voting and polling.",
    "decide the state of world politics. This highlights the importance of creating a system that\nis truly confidential, verifiable and transparent, and indicates the magnitude of one problem\nwe plan to solve with Verus.\n3.3.2Running, Recording, and Scaling Polls - Transient, PoS ChainsUsing autochains, Verus will dynamically create parallel voting chains on demand for each\npoll in its ecosystem. This creates improved, isolated security and allows for scaling in a\nvirtually unlimited manner.\nThe Verus wallet, which will be used for voting, will also have the ability to validate blocks\nthrough proof-of-stake, blocks which, when enabled, will allow voters who are validating the\nelection to earn rewards. These rewards will either be paid in Virtue for intrinsic polls, when\navailable, or from outputs of the payment transaction that instantiated the poll. When a\npoll is complete, results are posted back to the main Verus chain. The chain used to run it\ncan then be archived or deleted, and it is typically abandoned.\n3.3.3Poll Content and Distributed Hash TablesWhile blockchains make excellent databases for permanent",
