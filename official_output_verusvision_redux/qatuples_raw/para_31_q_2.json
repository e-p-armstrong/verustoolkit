    "What features will Verus polls support?",
    "Verus polls may support various features, including confidential or public voting, live or delayed poll results, online or offline vote authorization, and lottery-selected vote authorization.",
    "Verus will support numerous types of polls, those that use weighted or unweighted voting,\nthat seek to expose truth or opinions, and polls that rate and choose collectively. In order to\n13create a sensible taxonomy for polls, one that people will understand, we define the following\ntypes of voting:\n1. Multiple choice\n2. Weighted multiple choice\n3. Ranking\n4. Rating\nWe also define the following types of polls:\n1. Polls to classify\n2. Polls to select\n3. Polls to rank\n4. Polls to rate\nWe do not expect Verus to support all voting and poll types in the early phases. In fact,\nuntil Phase IV, the Verus core team plans to focus on known requirements of multiple choice\nand weighted multiple choice voting. During or after completion of Phase IV, expanding\nsupport for voting and poll types will be higher priority.\nEach type of Verus poll may support confidential or public voting, live or delayed poll\nresults, online or offline vote authorization, and lottery selected vote authorization. We will\nroll out working vote models in phases, as well, initially providing solutions for weighted and\nunweighted selection voting, which fits well for both political and opinion polls as well as\ncontent classification and ID verification.\n3.3.5Intrinsic Polls",
