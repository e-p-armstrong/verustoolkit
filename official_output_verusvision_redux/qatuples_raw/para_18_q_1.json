    "What is the role of Eigentrust ratings in the autochain node selection process?",
    "Eigentrust ratings are used to record the performance of nodes on the autochain. Nodes that consistently offer better QoS will get better ratings, while nodes that get poorly rated will be less likely to be selected in the next node lottery. However, even poorly rated nodes will still share in the node rewards for the current blockchain.",

They will then be able to use this recognition to boost their\nreputation for selection in future lotteries.\nBy advertising autochain node support on the main blockchain \u2013 along with a stable\npayment address via a transaction \u2013 the node IP can be selected in a random lottery.
