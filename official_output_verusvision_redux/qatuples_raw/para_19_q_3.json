    "What is the minimum percentage of total mining power required for an attacker to successfully launch an attack on the Bitcoin network?",
    "To successfully launch an attack on the Bitcoin network, an attacker would need to control more than 50% of the total power of all miners \u2013 both honest and byzantine.",
    "to belief in any individual human\u2019s behavior, but based on the tendency of\nhumans to act in their own self-interest.\nThe Bitcoin protocol rewards winners of a contest, referred to as \u201cminers\u201d, in statistical\nproportion to the computing power they employ to \u201cmine\u201d for Bitcoin, as compared to the\ntotal computing power of all miners. For every block of validated transactions added to\nthe Bitcoin blockchain, someone wins a competition to earn the right to define that block\nwhile adhering to specific, verifiable rules. The competition involves verifiably solving a\nstatistical mathematical puzzle that is specific to exactly that block, meaning the same work\ncannot be reused on any other block. The winner of each competition earns the right to\naccurately process the next block of pending Bitcoin transactions and to claim a specific\nmeasure of Bitcoin, called the \u201cblock reward\u201d (plus fees of all transactions in the block that\nwas processed).\nMining competition serves to determine the amount of computing power a would-be\nattacker would have to control in order to mine of blocks that were not earned according to\nthe intended rules, execute transactions that might otherwise be rejected, and prevent certain\ntransactions from executing altogether. Based on the way that miners achieve consensus\non what is the correct chain, forging a false Bitcoin chain to achieve this would require\nan attacker to control more than 50% of the total power of all miners \u2013 both honest and\nbyzantine.\nSince, right now, it is likely infeasible for any single actor to mount such an attack against\nBitcoin, the largest network of hash power today, this type of competition, called proof-ofwork (PoW), currently manages hundreds of billions of dollars of value, sends transactions of\nthat value to anyone, anywhere, at any time, and does this all without any company, bank,\nor trusted third party, of any kind.\nIn",
