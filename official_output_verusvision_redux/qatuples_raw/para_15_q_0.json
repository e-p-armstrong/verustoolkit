    "What is the goal of Verus in terms of creating a platform for voting and election systems?",
    "Verus aims to create a platform that enables a better society through blockchain, specifically by building voting and even election systems on top of its blockchain-based system.",
    "With Verus, we plan to create a platform upon which we will build voting and even election\nsystems that support our vision of enabling a better society through blockchain.\nTo run simultaneous polls across disparate populations on one blockchain-based system,\nwe need another dimension of information \u2013 one that retains privacy, and is anchored to a\nprimary store of value, Verus.\nOne approach to creating another dimension of meaning would be a system of \u201ccoloring.\u201d\nThe Ethereum blockchain system and some layers over Bitcoin or Bitcoin compatible coins\nuse a version of a coloring system. [5][6][7][8]. While, at first glance, this seems like a\nreasonable approach, it is actually a suboptimal solution, at best.\nWith Ethereum and the ICO experiences of 2017 [9][10], we now know what happens when\nyou create one blockchain and overload it with transactions: Congestion and unnecessarily\nhigh fees. Developers have proposed many solutions to this problem of scaling \u2013 including\na move to proof-of-stake systems and sharding (effectively trying to separate the various7functions on a blockchain), or even a move to large systems of parallel chains with a common\ndesign.\nYet instead of implementing a \u201csolution\u201d with colored coins sharing one blockchain, we\nhave decided to take a completely new approach to this problem. Our approach will not\nonly provide an extra dimension of information and an unlimited number of token types,\nor \u201ccolors\u201d, but it will do so with highly scalable PBaaS autochains, which also reward\nVerus miners and node operators as provisioning agents. This is a novel method of scaling,\none which provides significant scale and security benefits through isolation of transaction\nprocessing for each application instance on its own blockchain.\nRather than thinking of Verus as a single blockchain, it is more appropriate\nto think of it as a blockchain-based system, one that is ",
