    "How do nodes on the autochain get selected for validation and what is the purpose of this selection?",
    "Nodes on the autochain get selected for validation through a random lottery. To participate in this lottery, nodes need to advertise their support for the autochain on the main blockchain along with a stable payment address via a transaction. The purpose of this selection is to allow nodes that consistently offer better Quality of Service (QoS) to get better ratings and increase their chances of being selected in future lotteries.",
