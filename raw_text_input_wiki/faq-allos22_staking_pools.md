A staking pool has advantages and disadvantages over solo staking:

**Disadvantages**:
 1. It causes centralization on the network
 2. The pool owner is in control of **all** funds in the pool, including yours.
 3. You need to trust the pool operator to share the rewards fairly.
 4. You need to trust the pool operator to release your funds back to you on request.
 5. You need to trust the pool operator to securely run the pool 24/7.

**Advantages**:
 1. You don't need to run your wallet 24/7 in native mode.

Warning: **Do your own research** before you decide anything!
