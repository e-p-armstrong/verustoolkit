# Question: What reward do I get for staking (PoS) or Mining (PoW) a block?

The reward received depends of the blocknummer:

##### Era 1:
1st week: Block 0 - 10080 ==> 0 to 384 VRSC reward ==> 16,588,800 VRSC total this period (reward rising linearly and changing each block)
##### Era 2:
1st month: Block 10080 - 53279 ==> 384 VRSC reward ==> 8,294,400 VRSC total this period
2nd month: Block 53280 - 96479 ==> 192 VRSC reward ==> 4,147,200 VRSC total this period
3rd month: Block 96480 - 139679 ==> 96 VRSC reward ==> 4,147,200 VRSC total this period
4th month: Block 139680 - 182879 ==> 48 VRSC reward ==> 2,073,600 VRSC total this period
5th month: Block 182880 - 226079 ==> 24 VRSC reward ==> 1,036,800 VRSC total this period
##### Era 3:
Years 1+2: Block 226080 - 1277279 ==> 24 VRSC reward ==> 25,228,800 VRSC total this period
Years 3+4: Block 1277280 - 2328479 ==> 12 VRSC reward ==> 12,614,400 VRSC total this period
Years 5+6: Block 2328480 - 3379679 ==> 6 VRSC reward ==> 6,307,200 VRSC total this period
. . . halving indefinitely every 1051200 blocks (approximately 2 years)

All rewards equal or over 192 VRSC are time locked to mature at a random block between 129,600 and 1,181,520
