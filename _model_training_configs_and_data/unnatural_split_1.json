Sentences may contain phrases like \u2013 very, extremely etc. which can be ignored while comparing strength of the sentence. Also, levels like \u2013 jail time >= life imprisonment should also be considered equal.\nCategory 2 - If position or power of the person mentioned in both sentences is different then output 'Upgrade' or 'Downgrade' based on whether it's an upgrade or downgrade with respect to position respectively elseoutput \u2018Same\u2019. For example, phrases containing words such as \u2013 president-> member can be assumed as Upgrade while vice versa can be assumed as Downgrade but not all cases will fit this template perfectly hence use your common sense along with these examples to determine right category.(e.g.- Dave was a good employee so his boss promoted him -> Upgrade) \n(e) The thief was arrested by police officer-> policeman (arrested by higher ranked personnel). \n(f) He killed many people so government sentenced him death row -> downgrades because powerful government has sentenced him.(not exactly similar but conveys the idea.) However there might exist some exceptions too where this method fails e.g.- He got first prize in chess competition-> no change in position/power.(depends on how you interpret it.)   \nCategory 3 -If subject matter of both sentences match each other i..e they talk about same thing however not necessarily from same perspective(may have completely opposite perspectives),output crosstalk else unrelated .     Crosstalk means that though content maybe totally different ,it still relate s somehow semantically . Example-He invented light bulb-> So he became famous CrossTalk because second sentence talks about result of what is being talked about firstly even tough from different perspective . Another Examples-   I wanted buy new phone>But my parents didn't allow me unrelated because content changes abruptly without any context link whatsoever however semantically its possible that someone would search for this kind of data i guess .. Again This tasks requires heavy usage intuition and some amount knowledge world affairs so do careful analysis before labelling something crosstalk especially when article seems total gibberish at first sight :) Good Luck!"

The sides may be solid or have vertical slats, mesh openings, or other structures that keep predators from reaching inside but still provide adequate ventilation and drainage. Some designs include featuring above-ground levels where smaller birds can find refuge from larger ones while they wait their turn at entering into nesting chamber below; these ledges must not interfere with adults' ability to enter/exit their nests safely nor cause young chicks falling out before they've grown enough feathers for flight..\nPassage 2: Most commercial bird houses are made of wood, usually cedar because it weathers well outdoors and doesn't rot easily if it gets wet. Other materials such as plastic and metal can also be used; however wooden houses last much longer than either one of those materials will. If you make your own bird house out of wood, make sure any type of paint or sealant you use is non-toxic since birds will be using this house to raise their young family in it later on down the road.. \nQuestion: Which passage mentions a common material used for construction?"

On contrary, two sentences contradict each other when they cannot both be true in any circumstance e.g., \"John came yesterday\" contradicts \"John didn't come yesterday\". When there is no logical relation between two sentences as neither of entailment directions hold and they do not contradict each other either - for instance when we compare \"The Earth orbits around Sun\" with \n\"2 plus 2 equals 4\", then these are unrelated statements - we label their relationship as 'none'."
