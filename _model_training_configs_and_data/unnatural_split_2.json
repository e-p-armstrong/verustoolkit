Reza Shah Pahlavi established it as successor state to Qajar Dynasty. Considered autocratic rather than constitutional, it lasted until 1979 when Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown and replaced by Islamic Republic. Under his reign many social, economic, and political reforms were imposed such that women's suffrage was introduced in 1963 elections for local city councils only; modern industries were developed; railroads constructed across country to expand trade both domestically and internationally; private banks opened alongside National Bank of Iran which became central bank; agrarian reforms carried out including endowment of 26 million acres (105 thousand square kilometers) land among five million peasants via Land Reform Law 1956 passed by parliament.[1][2]Passage B: Question: Was the Imperial State of Iran considered an autocratic state?"

The airtight seal also prevented oxygen from oxidizing and degrading the quality of the contents. However, due largely to its high cost and challenges with consistent heating during mass production, this process was largely supplanted by less expensive methods using tin cans starting in 1850s by someone named Peter Durand."

These requirements must be met before an employee or employer can receive any tax benefits from making contributions to, or receiving distributions from, such a plan. For example, most pension plans in the United States are qualified under IRC section 401(a), which contains many detailed provisions that govern how such plans operate. Qualified retirement plans also typically provide employees with some level of income during their retirement years. \nPassage B: In order for a retirement plan to be considered \"qualified\" under IRS rules, it must meet certain criteria related to taxes. For example, most pension plans in the U.S. qualify under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which sets forth numerous provisions governing operation of these types of plans.. Employers and employees may receive various tax benefits if they contribute money towards \u2013 or take distributions from \u2013 a qualified retirement plan; however, all relevant IRC conditions must first be satisfied.\"\nQuestion: Which of following statements is TRUE according to Passages A and B?"
