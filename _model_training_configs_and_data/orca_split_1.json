Negative: The reviewer may be using sarcasm or irony, implying that the movie is not good enough to win any Academy Awards. In this case, the statement would indicate a negative opinion of the movie.\n\n3. Neutral: The reviewer could be merely stating a fact about the movie, without expressing a clear opinion, such as if the movie has been nominated for or has won Academy Awards. This interpretation doesn't provide enough information to determine if the opinion is positive or negative.\n\nWithout additional context or information about the review, it's not possible to definitively label the opinion as either positive or negative.

The moment she saw it, she knew this was the perfect addition to her growing collection of vintage appliances. It was a charming avocado-green model from the 1970s, which matched her washing machine and refrigerator.\n\nAs a staunch environmentalist and someone who appreciated the quality and style of older appliances, Amy subscribed to the notion of \"reduce, reuse, recycle.\" She took joy in finding these bargains and putting them to good use, instead of seeing them end up in a landfill or wasting resources on manufacturing new appliances.\n\nOnce she got the dryer home, she called her friend, Dave, a knowledgeable handyman and fellow vintage appliance enthusiast, to help install it. Dave, always eager to lend a hand and share his expertise, came right over.\n\nTogether, they carefully examined the dryer to ensure that it was in good working condition. Dave inspected its electrical components, the thermostat, and the heating element. He also checked the drum and its accompanying belt, looking for signs of wear and damage. To Amy\u2019s delight, the dryer was in surprisingly excellent condition, considering its age.\n\nNext, they unplugged her old dryer and removed it from the designated space. Since Amy was an advocate of repurposing items, she decided to give her old dryer to a neighbor in need. With the old dryer out of the way, Dave and Amy proceeded to install the new-to-her thrift store find.\n\nTo install the dryer, they first leveled the unit on the laundry room floor, making sure it rested solidly on all its feet to prevent vibrations and noise during operation. They then connected the dryer\u2019s exhaust duct to the vent that extended outside, ensuring all connections were secure and free of leaks.\n\nOnce the vent was connected, they attached the power cord and connected it to the 240-volt outlet that was specifically designed for dryers. Finally, after ensuring that all safety precautions had been followed, they cautiously plugged in the dryer and turned it on for a trial run.\n\nThe avocado-green dryer hummed to life, and Amy couldn't help but smile with satisfaction as warm air filled the drum and the familiar scent of freshly dried laundry began to permeate the air.\n\nTo celebrate their successful installation, Amy and Dave sat down for a cup of coffee in her cozy kitchen, which was adorned with vintage d\u00e9cor. They chatted about their shared appreciation for older appliances, their reliability, and the charm they add to a living space. It was moments like these that Amy cherished, as they demonstrated the power of sustainability and community through her love for vintage appliances.\n\nIn conclusion, Amy buying a used dryer from the thrift store not only turned out to be a fantastic bargain, but it also allowed her to contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle and strengthen her connection with her handyman friend, creating a heartwarming story driven by shared passions and environmental consciousness."

As the ship sets sail, a stowaway steals on to the boat and hides under the canvas cover of a life boat.The ship makes its way through the stormy south Indian Ocean. Wilson gathers the crew for a meeting to tell them where they're going, saying he couldn't risk telling them anything until they were far out of port. Wilson shows them a pair of photographs of an innocuous fog bank. One picture was taken in the 1940s by a US Navy vessel. The second was taken a few weeks prior to their departure from Surabaya. Wilson also shares another photo, this one taken by a US satellite that went off course and was armed with spectrographic instruments. The readings from the satellite, explained by Wilson's geologist, show that an island may exist behind the fog bank and that it may have petroleum deposits on it. Wilson is very excited, believing that, with the oil and gas shortage causing economic problems for Petrox back in the States, that the island will be a rich source of oil for the company.At that moment the meeting is interrupted by the same man who stowed away in the life boat. The stranger identifies himself as Jeff Prescott, a paleo-primatologist, who had snuck aboard the ship specifically because it was going to the island. He talks about the island's other secret: that a large beast inhabits the island, is the dominate life form there and is worshipped as a god by the local native tribe. Jeff also talks about a strange wedding ritual the natives follow to placate the beast; that a beautiful woman must be \"wed\" to it to satisfy it's temper.Wilson believes Jeff is a spy and orders him detained until they can run a check on his credentials. While they lead him away on the main deck, Jeff spots a life raft floating some distance away. When the raft is salvaged, they find a beautiful blond woman unconscious, but..."

Rising up: Carole, pictured after visiting her grandson George for the first time at St Mary's Hospital in London, has long been seen to have aristocratic aspirations. The agonies of how to design a new family coat of arms is one no doubt familiar to every aspirational family. So it can come as no surprise that faced with such a challenge the astute former air stewardess Carole Middleton - mother of the Duchess of Cambridge - sought the advice of those valued by other great British families - even those that don't actually exist. Downton Abbey has been revealed as the unlikely source of inspiration as the socially mobile Mrs Middleton set out to design her family crest in the run up to the 2011 royal wedding. The family even went to Highclere Castle, the set for ITV's award winning period drama, to meet etiquette expert historian Alastair Bruce who advises the show on social protocol. They were so delighted by the royal equerry's knowledge they asked him for help with the design of their own crest which was later used to adorn the programme at the Royal Wedding in April 2011. Mr Bruce, 53, is an expert on protocol and advises the actors and production team on the set of the show to make sure every aspect of every scene is historically accurate. Affectionately nicknamed the Oracle he has been known to stop filming because he spotted that the 'wrong' shoebrush was being used to shine some boots and is often found pacing the length of the Downton dining room adjusting cutlery and pleading with actors to keep their hands off the table. A source told The Sun: 'Alastair is also a Queen's Herald, so he has a lot of experience. 'But I'm sure people will be amused to know the Middletons looked to Downton Abbey for help in coming up with the coat of arms.' Although as a royal bride Kate would have been entitled to apply for a heraldic design in her own right, it was decided that her parents would commission one. How it might have been: Had she been without the help of her aristocratic advisors this is how the Middleton crest might have turned out. A high-class line-up: The cast of the popular show Downton Abbey. Painstaking process: After much discussion about the design Herald Painter Robert Parsons, sketches the Coat of Arms for the Middleton family. Coats of Arms came into being during medieval tournaments like jousting when knights would be recognised by the motifs on their shields or helmets and heralds quickly learnt the different ones in use, taking up responsibility for the control of their use.Over time their use began to decline in competition and battle but they became more widely used in society.The College of Arms, a branch of the Royal household, is the official body in the UK that deals with coats of arms and their team of experts - funded by the fees they charge and not taxpayers money - design and research heraldic or genealogical issues.The arms are given for free while the money people pay is for the research and design of the coat of arms.However, that doesn't mean that just anybody can pay the fee and get a coat of arms. The cumulative knowledge of the Earl Marshal gathered over hundreds of years has given them the skill of tactfully suggesting that people don't proceed with their application.The late Peter Gwynn-Jones, a former Garter King of Arms, once said: 'In practice, eligibility depends upon holding a civil or military commission, a sound university degree or professional qualification, or having achieved some measure of distinction in a field beneficial to society as a whole.' This gives his entire family \u2013 including their other children, Pippa, 30, and James, 26, the right to use the emblem. They met with Mr Bruce and his colleague Thomas Woodcock the College of Arms Garter Principle King of Arms and Senior Herald to invent their crest. Together they settled on a simple design, with three leafy acorns representing each of the couple\u2019s three children \u2013 an idea suggested by Kate herself. Acorns were chosen for the analogy that they grow into great oaks. Oak is also a symbol of England and strength, and West Berkshire, where the children were brought up, has many oak trees. Most eye-catching is the gold chevron in the centre of the design representing Kate\u2019s mother, Carole, at the heart of her family with the colour a subtle reference to her maiden name, Goldsmith. The two thin white chevronels on either side allude to mountains and the family\u2019s love of skiing and outdoor pursuits. The background colours of red and blue were chosen as they are the principle colours from the flag of the United Kingdom and match Prince William\u2019s recently revised coat of arms. The College of Arms also likes to include a pun wherever possible and has made the two colours meet squarely in the centre as a play on the words \u2018middle tone\u2019. But while Kate's brother James will be able to pass down the coat of arms to his children Pippa, as a woman, will not and can only use it during her lifetime. Yesterday a spokesman for Downton Abbey confirmed: 'Alastair worked with the Garter Principal King of Arms on developing the Middleton crest.' Royal wedding programme: Prince William's coat of arms was printed on the front while Kate's, designed in complimentary colours, decorated the back.\nSummarize the highlights of this article."

Formed in 1997 in Houston, Texas, Destiny's Child members began their musical career as Girl's Tyme, formed in 1990, comprising Knowles, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett among others. After years of limited success, the quartet were signed in 1997 to Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment as Destiny's Child. Destiny's Child was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of their best-selling second album, The Writing's on the Wall (1999), which contained the number-one singles \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" and \"Say My Name\".\n\nDestiny's Child reunited for a farewell performance at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game on February 19, 2006 in Houston, Texas; however, Knowles commented, \"It's the last album, but it's not the last show.\" Their final televised performance was at the Fashion Rocks benefit concert in New York a few days later. On March 28, 2006, Destiny's Child was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the 2,035th recipient of the coveted recognition. At the 2006 BET Awards, Destiny's Child won Best Group, a category they also earned in 2005 and 2001.  After their formal disbandment, all members resumed their solo careers and have each experienced different levels of success. Since then, Knowles, Rowland and Williams have continued to collaborate on each other's solo projects through song features, music video appearances, and live performances. Both Rowland and Williams, along with Knowles' sister Solange, appeared in Knowles' music video for her single \"Get Me Bodied\" (2007). On June 26, 2007, the group made a mini-reunion at the 2007 BET Awards, where Knowles performed \"Get Me Bodied\" with Williams and Solange as her back-up dancers. After her performance, Knowles introduced Rowland who performed her single \"Like This\" (2007) with Eve. On the September 2, 2007 Los Angeles stop of The Beyonce Experience tour, Knowles sang a snippet of \"Survivor\" with Rowland and Williams, and the latter two rendered a \"Happy Birthday\" song to Knowles. The performance was featured in Knowles' tour DVD, The Beyonce Experience Live. In 2008, Knowles recorded a cover of Billy Joel's \"Honesty\" for Destiny's Child's compilation album Mathew Knowles & Music World Present Vol.1: Love Destiny, which was released only in Japan to celebrate the group's tenth anniversary.  Rowland made a cameo appearance in Knowles' music video for her single \"Party\" (2011), and the group's third compilation album, Playlist: The Very Best of Destiny's Child, was released in 2012 to mark the fifteenth anniversary since their formation. The fourth compilation album, Love Songs, was released on January 29, 2013, and included the newly recorded song \"Nuclear\", produced by Pharrell Williams. \"Nuclear\" marked the first original music from Destiny's Child in eight years. The following month, Rowland and Williams appeared as special guests for Knowles' Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, where they performed \"Bootylicious\", \"Independent Women\" and Knowles' own song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". A video album titled Destiny's Child Video Anthology was released in May 2013 and featured sixteen of the group's music videos. Knowles and Williams were then featured on Rowland's song \"You Changed\" from her fourth solo album Talk a Good Game (2013). Later that year, Rowland and Williams made cameo appearances in the music videos for Knowles' songs \"Superpower\" and \"Grown Woman\", which were both included on her self-titled fifth solo visual album. Williams released the single \"Say Yes\" in June 2014, featuring Knowles and Rowland. They performed \"Say Yes\" together during the 2015 Stellar Awards, and the live version of the song was mastered for iTunes in April 2015. On November 7, 2016, the group reunited in a video to try the Mannequin Challenge, which was posted on Rowland's official Instagram account.\n\nWas the video popular?"

The first time I tried watching it I could only make it halfway through, before losing interest. Again it gets off to a good start (especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with Dracula), but then for me it got less involving when it hits New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. A great place to set it, but never took advantage of its settings (despite etching a paradise in damn, where Dracula could flourish). Produced by Wes Carven (and yeah they throw that name out there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals, but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts don't help. The messy script does get considerably silly. Lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy, inserting a lot of blood (the make-up is suitably achieved) and a lot of \"Virgin\" advertising. No I don't mean virgins, it's the music company, as it does get in numerous shots and Helsing's daughter works there too. Oh that wasn't obvious planting. The soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes. Now the performances are all over the shop, but there are few familiar faces to spot (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula just didn't come off, as not much of a presence was formed. He was simply out-shined by the succulent ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's brides. The likes of Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are respectably okay. Christopher Plummer gives out a grizzled turn as Van Helsing and Omar Epps has fun with his role."

Plot title: Went the Day Well? Movie plot: The story is told in flashback by a villager, played by Mervyn Johns, as though to a person visiting after the war. He recounts: one Saturday during the Second World War, a group of seemingly authentic British soldiers arrive in the small, fictitious English village of Bramley End.[1] It is the Whitsun weekend so life is even quieter than usual and there is almost no traffic of any kind. At first they are welcomed by the villagers, until doubts begin to grow about their true purpose and identity. After they are revealed to be German soldiers intended to form the vanguard of an invasion of Britain, they round up the residents and hold them captive in the local church. The vicar is shot after sounding the church bell in alarm. In attempts to reach the outside world, many of the villagers take action. Such plans include writing a message on an egg and giving them to the local paper boy for his mother, but they are crushed when Mrs Fraser's cousin runs over them. Mrs Fraser then puts a note in Cousin Maude's pocket, but she uses it to hold her car window in place; her dog, Edward, then chews it to shreds after it blows onto the back seat. Mrs Collins, the postmistress, manages to kill a German with an axe used for chopping firewood, and tries to telephone elsewhere. The girls on the exchange see her light and decide that she can wait. Mrs Collins waits until she is killed by another German who walks into the shop moments afterwards. The girl at the exchange then picks up the phone, getting no reply. The civilians attempt to escape to warn the local Home Guard, but are betrayed by the village squire, who is revealed to be collaborating with the Germans. Members of the local Home Guard are ambushed and shot by the Germans. They begin to bow in until a young boy, George, succeeds in escaping; despite being shot in the leg, he alerts the army. British soldiers arrive, and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 aided by some of the villagers, including a group of Women's Land Army girls, who have managed to escape, barricade themselves in, and arm...

I've used numerous varieties of the Roland sardines: olive oil, s&b in olive oil, tomato sauce, etc.  The S&B version with low sodium and packed in water is my best recommendation/preference: a great value for the money, and practically a steal when you compare -per ounce- the price with other brands.  Then, consider the discount(s) when purchasing through Amazon, and it'll be tough to choose another.  Why?  Many other brands charge the same price as -or more than Roland- with only a 3.5-oz tin, whereas Roland includes more fish in the tin.  The quality is consistent, and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stir-fries, salads, pasta dishes, etc. without overpowering the other flavors.  Oddly enough, I was half-mindful when perusing a semi-local dollar store which is renowned for carrying a ton of food items in my city.  I was looking to make some lower-cost and healthier choices in my diet at the time (not expecting to find these, of course, but rather turning my nose up at the usual crud I saw stocked there) when I accidentally stumbled across them.  At $1 per tin, it was a huge buy, so I tried a few.  The rest, as they say, is history as aforementioned. \n Summary: Most excellent sardines!"

At the time, the two actors were already in their mid-30s, but they were still able to mount a bad-boy generational assault against all things civil and decent. \"The Internship\" reunites Wilson, with his smarm-that-looks-like-sweetness (or is it the other way around?), and Vaughn, with his disaffected fast patter. The audience is still rooting for them \u2014 only this time the two are playing the older, stodgy guys.\n\nThey're Nick (Wilson) and Billy (Vaughn), designer-watch salesman who lose their careers in what seems like the tick of a second hand. Tossed into a dead-end job market, without any real prospects, they talk their way into an internship on the sprawling, buzzy Silicon Valley campus of Google, where they're pitted against a bunch of brainiac 20-year-olds who live and breathe technology and don't get any of the pair's pathetically ancient pop-culture references (Stalag 17, anyone?). Directed by the workmanlike Shawn Levy (who made the Night at the Museum films and Date Night), the movie is a halfway clever cookie-cutter culture-clash comedy, but there's a reason that it lacks the highs of \"Wedding Crashers:\" The Internship puts us on the side of those who are trying to hold on to respectability, not tear it down.\n\nThe movie was made with the cooperation of Google, which is why its basic attitude toward the search engine that changed the world is one of unironic reverence. True, the place can come off looking a bit goofy and obsessive. The leader of the internship program is Mr. Chetty (The Daily Show's Aasif Mandvi), a po-faced corporate guru who lights up whenever he extols the virtues of ethereal concepts like ''Googliness.'' And when the army of interns gets divvied up into a dozen competing teams, only one of which will ultimately land jobs there, Nick and Bill are stuck with the social outliers that no one else wants \u2014 the geeks among geeks. They're led by Lile (Josh Brener), a shrimpy, horn-rimmed genius who tries to fit in by saying things like ''fo shizzle.'' (He's clearly been saying that since he was about five.)\n\nThe actors cast as Google interns are likable and mildly amusing in a \"Revenge of the Nerds\" 2013 way. But I wish that at least one of them had been given a major voice, a way of making the tech banter seem hilariously cool. The likeliest candidate would have been Stuart (Dylan O'Brien), with his sullen stare and open contempt for our heroes, but the character loses his superior edge over time, which is the movie's mistake. It's up to Nick and Bill to teach these brilliant losers how to live, and what that comes down to is showing them that it's fun to let go and do Tequila shots and dance like crazy and hit on people. How rebellious!\n\nThe Internship was written by Vaughn and Jared Stern, and it's got little jabs of wit, like the scene in which Nick and Bill are duped into addressing a bald instructor in a wheelchair as ''Professor Charles Xavier'' (he is not pleased). A lot of the film is devoted to showing how the cult of technology and the human element don't need to be opposed; they can, and should, work hand in hand. That's a nice message (and it's certainly a swell advertisement for Google), but it's not a funny message. \"The Internship\" gets so caught up in healing the generational divide that it's ostensibly about \u2014 the analog dudes vs. the digital kids \u2014 that the movie ends up being just a pleasant collection of mild laughs. It needed more spin, more Googliness. Grade: B\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly\n\n\u00a9 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

Plot title: Dracula: Prince of Darkness Movie plot: A prologue replays the final scenes from Dracula, in which Dr. Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) destroys Dracula (Christopher Lee) by driving him into the sunlight. These scenes are accompanied by voice-over narration that describes how Van Helsing, a scholar of vampirism, was able to end Dracula's century-long reign of terror and destroy his cult; only the memory of Dracula's evil remains. The main story begins as Father Sandor prevents local authorities from disposing of a woman's corpse as if it were a vampire. Sandor chastises the presiding priest for perpetuating the fear of vampirism, and reminds him that Dracula was destroyed 10 years previously. Sandor visits an inn and warns four English tourists \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Kents \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not to visit Karlsbad; they ignore his advice. As night approaches, the Kents find themselves abandoned by their fear-stricken coach driver two kilometres from Karlsbad, in view of a castle. A driverless carriage takes them to the castle, where they find a dining table set for four people and their bags unpacked in the bedrooms. A servant named Klove explains that his master, the late Count Dracula, ordered that the castle should always be ready to welcome strangers. After dinner the Kents settle in their rooms. Later that night, Alan investigates a noise and follows Klove to the crypt, where Klove kills him and mixes his blood with Dracula's ashes, reviving the Count. Klove entices Helen to the crypt, where she becomes Dracula's first victim. The next morning Charles and Diana can find no trace of Alan, Helen or Klove. Charles takes Diana to a woodsman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hut and then he returns to the castle to search for Alan and Helen. Klove tricks Diana into returning to the castle. Charles finds Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dismembered body in a trunk in the crypt. It is now dark and Dracula rises. Diana meets Helen, but Helen has become one of the undead and she attacks her. Dracula enters and warns Helen away from Diana. Charles struggles with Dracula until Diana realises her crucifix is an effective weapon against... My question: Who plays Diana?"

Plus, a school may not have a wide selection of clipboards compared to a dedicated office supply store.\n\nOption C, an ammunition shop, is also not a suitable choice as it deals with firearms and related items, and it is highly unlikely that such a store would carry clipboards or any office supplies.\n\nOption E, a desk, could be a place where Sam might find a clipboard, but it is not an optimum choice as it only refers to a specific location within an environment. It does not guarantee the availability of additional clipboards for Sam.\n\nIn conclusion, option D, an office supply store, is the most suitable and reliable option for Sam if he needs to obtain more clipboards. These stores typically have an extensive range of office supplies and stationery items, including various types, sizes, and designs of clipboards to meet different preferences and requirements.

But that ending has meaning only if you watch the movie from the beginning.\n\nYouth alienation in the late 1960's, from the viewpoint of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious theme of \"Zabriskie Point\". Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin had much acting experience, a fact that actually enhances the film's message. Having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism, as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around them.\n\nThis is not a script-driven film. Except for the first ten minutes, it is mostly visual, with stunning cinematography. The beautiful naturalistic images seem other-worldly, and perfectly in sync with the emotional detachment of Mark and Daria.\n\nI would have replaced the thematically weak Pink Floyd music with the more cogent music of The Doors. Many scenes cry out for \"Riders On The Storm\".\n\nEven so, I like this film. It's different; it's unique; it is artistic and imaginative. And the desert badlands are beautiful.\n\nAs the years go by, \"Zabriskie Point\" seems more and more attractive. It conveys the mood of the late 1960's in America. It is amazingly artistic, in a bohemian sort of way. And the film's last eight minutes are philosophically mesmerizing.\nWould you say this review is positive or negative?\npick from the following.

Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.

This concept contradicts the core values of the Juche ideology, as it would involve reliance on the United States and undermine North Korea's pursuit of independence and self-reliance.\n\nMoreover, historically, North Korea has had an antagonistic relationship with the United States, and the two countries have significant ideological differences. North Korea is a one-party socialist state with a centrally planned economy, while the United States is a federal republic with a capitalist, market-oriented economic system. The two nations have been involved in several political conflicts and diplomatic crises, most notably during the Korean War and the ongoing issues regarding North Korea's nuclear program.

But a lot of what they need is already littering around your house. If you don't have reusable school supplies at home, you might have the materials to make them.

Here are a few ideas to get you started: *Sew blue jeans into pencil cases. *Turn shoeboxes into arts storage boxes. *Use an old belt as a books belt. *Wrap book covers in old posters. Up-cycling is a great way to develop artistic talent and creative thinking in your children. ********************************************************************************* PLAN TO PACK AHEAD Most teachers and schools reward green behavior among students.

These days, they are looking for at-risk kids to prevent personal or academic troubles before they arise. Nowadays, students and families need the guidance more than ever.  Counselors play a steadying role in schools as the economy weighs on families, college admission becomes even more competitive, immigration continues to reshape the population and state-testing pressures many students. They use computers to search through attendance data, grades and standardized test scores for kids who might need extra help.  Schlatter, director of guidance and counseling at Prince William County's Woodbridge Senior High School, has checked attendance records against grades and test results to start peer groups   for students who are failing classes but not skipping them. She said group counseling is another way to reach more students though it can be difficult. \"Kids really do start helping and sharing with each other.\"  At Fairfax High School, counselors found through surveys that students who transferred   to the school after ninth grade enjoyed school significantly less than those who had been there all four years. The counseling staff set up a special program and group for new arrivals in response, said Marcy Miller, the school's director of student services. Counseling staff members also have started small study groups for students to prepare for state Standards of Learning exams, which Miller said have helped raise test scores. She said that some of the newest counselors have had some of the freshest ideas. Question: We can learn from the passage that   _  .

Now, there's a way to bring the comforting aromas of fall into your skincare routine - by creating a DIY Pumpkin Pie Spice Coconut Scrub! This all-natural scrub is a fantastic way to help your skin look and feel its best. Made with just four ingredients, it's simple to make and perfect for gifting - or keeping all to yourself! \n\nIn this article, we'll guide you through the step-by-step process of creating this deliciously scented and effective homemade scrub.\n\nMaterials Needed:\n\n1. A jar with a cover (8-ounce mason jars work great)\n2. 1/2 cup coconut oil\n3. 1/4 cup honey\n4. 1 cup brown sugar\n5. 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice\n\nStep 1: Combine the Coconut Oil and Honey\n\nThe first step to creating your Pumpkin Pie Spice Coconut Scrub is to combine the coconut oil and honey in a mixing bowl. Both of these ingredients are known for their nourishing and moisturizing properties, making them a perfect base for a gentle yet effective exfoliant. Coconut oil is full of healthy fats that help protect and nourish your skin, while honey acts as a natural antibacterial agent and humectant, helping to lock in moisture. \n\nStep 2: Stir in the Brown Sugar and Pumpkin Pie Spice\n\nAfter the coconut oil and honey have been combined, it's time to add the brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice. Brown sugar is an excellent natural exfoliant, as it gently removes dead skin cells, revealing softer, smoother skin. Additionally, the pumpkin pie spice not only gives the scrub an enticing aroma but also provides antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits. \n\nCarefully stir the brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice into the coconut oil and honey mixture. Be sure to thoroughly mix the ingredients, ensuring an even distribution of the sugar and spice throughout the scrub. \n\nStep 3: Store the Scrub in a Covered Jar\n\nFinally, transfer your completed Pumpkin Pie Spice Coconut Scrub into a jar with a cover. An 8-ounce mason jar works well, as it not only allows for easy storage but also adds a charming, rustic aesthetic to your scrub. Make sure the jar is clean and dry before adding the scrub.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWith your DIY Pumpkin Pie Spice Coconut Scrub complete, your skin will be ready for the cooler months ahead. This delightful and aromatic scrub makes an excellent gift for friends and family or a perfect addition to your own pampering routine. The combination of exfoliating brown sugar, moisturizing coconut oil and honey, and the soothing properties of pumpkin pie spice will leave your skin feeling soft, smooth, and reinvigorated. Happy scrubbing!"

The rapid spread of Facebook, which has more than 500 million users worldwide, has prompted concerns about its negative effects, but researchers at the University of Texas have reached a different conclusion. \"Our findings suggest that Facebook is not replacing face-to-face interactions between friends, family and colleagues,\" said S.Craig Watkins, an associate professor of radio, TV and film who headed the research team. \"In fact, we believe there is sufficient evidence that social media afford opportunities for new expressions of friendship, intimacy and community.\" The researchers questioned 900 college students and recent graduates about how and with whom they interact on Facebook. More than 60 percent of Facebook users said posting status updates was among the most popular activities, followed by 60 percent who wrote comments on their profile and 49 percent who posted messages and comments to friends. The researchers also found that although about the same number of men and women use Facebook, they do so in different ways. \"There is a noteworthy difference in aims in how to use a tool like Facebook.We found that for women the content tends to be more affectionate, and (they) are especially interested in using it for connection,\" said Watkins. \"For men, it's more functional,\" he added. Watkins pointed out that, for example, women are more likely to post pictures of social gatherings with friends, while men are more likely to post pictures of hobbies, or post a political or pop-culture related link. Options: A It is positive to personal ties B It has negative effects on personal ties C It makes no difference to personal ties D It has both good and bad effects to personal ties Answer: B It has negative effects on personal ties"

Secondly, the mention of \"delicious deli and quality sides\" indicates that the reviewer appreciates the quality of the food and believes it is enjoyable and well-prepared.\n\nAdditionally, the reviewer highlights that the establishment offers beer, wine, and some unexpected food options, all of which contribute to a positive experience for the customer. Furthermore, even though the reviewer refers to it as a \"small hole in the wall,\" the context suggests that this description is intended as an endearing remark, rather than a negative one, as it highlights that this place is a hidden gem with more to offer than one would expect.\n\nOverall, the positive language, enthusiasm, and appreciation for the food and atmosphere lead to the conclusion that the review is indeed positive."

Adding 37 and then subtracting 37 doesn't change anything, like taking out 37 candies and then putting them back. So, we can ignore those two numbers:\n\n0 = -l\n\nNow, we're left with the equation without the 37 candies. We need to find the value of \"l\". Currently, \"l\" is being multiplied by -1 (that's what the \"-\" sign means). To solve for \"l\", we need to do the opposite. Instead of multiplying by -1, we need to divide by -1:\n\n0 \u00f7 -1 = l\n\nAnd you know what? Zero divided by any number (even -1) is still zero. So our answer is:\n\nl = 0\n\nWe found out that \"l\" equals zero, which is like having an empty basket."

Question: How does Foster get crooks to participate? Title: Kansas City Confidential Movie plot: Joe Rolfe (John Payne) is an every-day Joe delivering flowers to the local businesses in Kansas City. When disgruntled cop Timothy Foster (Preston S. Foster) cases a local payroll delivery van for a holdup he takes into account the schedule of Rolfe and his deliveries as he plans his getaway. Foster contacts three crooks to help with the crime while keeping his own identity secret he blackmails them with past crimes and a guarantee of a $300 thousand-dollar payout for each. Pulling in Peter Harris (Jack Elam), Boyd Kane (Neville Brand), and Tony Romano (Lee Van Cleef), Foster pulls off a robbery of a bank next to one of Rolfe's deliveries and then by using a duplicate flower van points the police to Rolfe who is arrested and brutally interrogated by the police. Eventually cleared Rolfe is determined to clear his name and sets out to find the crew that set him up. He tracks Harris to a gambling joint in Mexico and takes on his identity and travels to a resort town in Tijuana to confront the rest of the crooks. Once there he meets Foster's daughter Helen (Coleen Gray) who has come to surprise her father. Rolfe and Helen develop an immediate attraction for each other and Foster attempts to keep them apart, as he plans to frame Rolfe for the bank job.

This outcome would be justified by the need to maintain a fair testing environment for all students.\n\n2. Rescheduling the test: Another possibility is that the testing site may allow Lee's friends to reschedule the test for a later date. This outcome would depend on the site's policies and the reason for their late arrival. It'd be justified if there were extenuating circumstances such as an emergency or a major traffic issue.\n\n3. Missed test opportunity: If Lee's friends are not allowed to take the test on that day or reschedule, they may miss the opportunity altogether. This could affect their academic progress, course grade, or eligibility for certain programs. This outcome would be justified by the expectation that students should be punctual and responsible in organizing their time to meet deadlines.\n\n4. Probation or disciplinary measures: Depending on their school or institution, Lee's friends may face additional consequences for missing the test. These could include academic probation, impacting their enrollment status, or required attendance at a disciplinary hearing. These outcomes would be justified by the need for institutions to hold students accountable for their actions.\n\nOverall, the consequences for Lee's friends will depend on the policies of their school or testing site and the specific circumstances surrounding their late arrival. Regardless of the outcome, it's important for students to learn from these experiences and strive to improve their time management and planning skills in the future."

You will need to choose what sort of museum you want to work for in order to pursue the appropriate education.  Consider what experiences have influenced your desire to be a museum curator. Were you inspired by an Aztec history exhibit you saw on a school field trip? Do you dream of working in a place like the Metropolitan Museum of Art? Be as specific as possible. If you know you want to work in a science museum, think about what aspects of science interest you the most. Chemistry? Physics? Astronomy? The more specific your choice, the more extensively you can educate yourself in it. Many colleges offer Bachelor\u2019s degrees in museology, or museum studies, but it\u2019s not absolutely necessary that you choose this as your major. Museums will look for candidates with extensive education and experience in a field that is relevant to what they\u2019re curating, such as art or history, as well as knowledge of business administration, marketing, and fundraising. Bachelor\u2019s degrees typically take 4 years to complete, although it may take more if you choose a double major. By this time, you should have some idea of what subject you want to focus on. If you became particularly interested in African art while getting your Bachelor\u2019s in art history, look for Master\u2019s programs that have a focus in African art.  Look at the faculty of graduate departments as well as the programs. Who you work with can have a great impact on your education, as well as your career. Many curators find jobs through the recommendations of professors in their field, so building a good relationship with faculty is a must.  Graduate programs typically take between 1.5 and 3 years to complete. Many lower-level curatorial positions only require a Master\u2019s, but if you want to become curator at a national museum, you\u2019ll need a PhD. This should be in the field you wish to specialize in. Because of the competitive nature of this field, a specialized degree is increasingly necessary. You want to demonstrate as much expertise in whatever you hope to curate as possible.  When you choose a subject for your thesis, it\u2019s ideal to find something unique that will stand out from other research in your field. Educate yourself on what research has already been done and aim to make a distinctive contribution. PhD programs typically take at least 5 years (the average length, however, is 8.2 years)."

        "value": "Whether you admit it or not, music improves our daily life and makes us feel easy, especially the music of Beethoven and Mozart. But can you believe that a school in England is using classical music to cut down students' bad behavior? The head teacher Brian Walker at the West Park School in Derby asks some students to stay behind after school on Fridays. He forces his students to listen to Mozart and other classical music. He also makes them copy his favorite poems and they have to watch educational videos. Mr. Walker says his main aim is to stop noisy pupils causing trouble in class for students who want to study. He said the students staying behind were \"not the smokers or drinkers, the truants   or the people who are late for school...It's those who have slowed the learning and teaching in class for everyone\". Mr. Walker said this was unacceptable, because it was making the rest of the students fail to focus their attention on their study. Mr. Walker believes what he does reminds students that education is something to value. \"It helps them see they are part of something bigger that will improve their life chances,\" he said. The head teacher thinks students in fact learn from being kept behind after school. \"Hopefully, I open their ears to an experience they don't normally have and don't want to have again, so it's both educational and acts as a warning.\" Music has had success elsewhere in reducing bad behavior. In 2004, it reduced crime on London's subway by 25 percent. Researchers from a Belfast university found it helped stop elephants' bad behavior. However, one West Park student called Kieran said, \"An hour of Mr. Walker's music is a real killer.\" Why does Mr. Walker say some students' bad behavior is unacceptable? A) Because the rest of the students hate them. B) Because they are wasting their life. C) Because they are disturbing teachers. D) Because they have a bad influence on the other students."

Dupr\u00e9 later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupr\u00e9 explained and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the \u00c9glise de la Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupr\u00e9, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'\u00e9glise \u00e9ternelle for organ. He married the violinist and composer Claire Delbos also in 1932. Their marriage inspired him to both compose works for her to play (Th\u00e8me et variations for violin and piano in the year they were married) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness, including the song cycle Po\u00e8mes pour Mi in 1936, which he orchestrated in 1937. Mi was Messiaen's affectionate nickname for his wife. In 1937 their son Pascal was born. The marriage turned to tragedy when Delbos lost her memory after an operation towards the end of World War II. She spent the rest of her life in mental institutions.In 1936, along with Andr\u00e9 Jolivet, Daniel-Lesur and Yves Baudrier, Messiaen formed the group La jeune France (\"Young France\"). Their manifesto implicitly attacked the frivolity predominant in contemporary Parisian music and rejected Jean Cocteau's 1918 Le coq et l'arlequin in favour of a \"living music, having the impetus of sincerity, generosity and artistic conscientiousness\". Messiaen's career soon departed from this polemical phase."

Although her mother was Egyptian, Diana considers herself part of the British upper class. At the station, she is noticed by Jamil El Shehab, a handsome good-natured Egyptian dragoman who enjoys romancing women tourists and freeing them from some of their jewelry. Jamil is immediately captivated by Diana and soon talks his way into becoming her official guide and driver in Egypt. While touring the Pyramids, Jamil manages to be alone with Diana and romances her with love songs. Meanwhile, Diana is also being wooed by Pasha Achmed, her fianc\u00e9's unscrupulous Egyptian business associate. In order to arrange to be alone with Diana, Pasha persuades Gerald to leave Cairo and inspect the aqueduct they are building together. When Jamil learns of the deception, he blackmails his countryman to remain silent. Later Jamil uses his position as a servant to enter Diana's hotel bedroom, and kisses her in a moment of passion. Although she briefly returns his kiss, Diana angrily fires him. Soon after, she and Gerald set out on a caravan across the desert with a new guide. Undaunted by Diana's rejection, Jamil follows and soon replaces the new guide. That night, Jamil's romantic singing has its effect on Diana, who is drawn into his arms again. When she realizes what is happening, she is outraged and strikes Jamil with a whip. On their way back to Cairo, however, Jamil sends the rest of the caravan on one route and tricks Diana into riding to Pasha's oasis retreat, where she is treated like royalty. When Pasha arrives, Jamil lies to him, telling him that Diana paid him to bring her to Pasha. When Pasha forces himself on her, she cries out for Jamil to save her, which he does, and the two ride off together in the night."

        "value": "Erin had long believed in ghosts and the paranormal. From a young age, she had been captivated by stories of spirits, haunted places, and the unexplained phenomena that seemed to defy what everyone knew to be true about the world. Naturally, she tended toward superstition in her everyday life, often attributing bizarre occurrences to the ghosts that she believed walked among the living.\n\nNatalie, on the other hand, was the polar opposite. A devout skeptic, she was unwavering in her conviction that every strange occurrence could be explained with enough logical scrutiny. While Erin attended paranormal conventions and read up on otherworldly beings, Natalie immersed herself in all things science-related. In her view, the natural world was infinitely more fascinating than the fictitious plane of existence imagined by those who indulged in supernatural fantasies.\n\nYet, despite their remarkably different viewpoints, the two friends shared a remarkably strong bond. In part, their friendship had endured simply because they were constantly challenging each other's beliefs. On more than one occasion, they had found themselves in the midst of a heated debate about the validity of a ghostly testimonial, the preposterous nature of the paranormal investigator's methods, or the statistical probability of spirits existing. Ironically, it seemed as though their disagreements only solidified their trust in each other.\n\nNow, the old Victorian house before them stood as a testament to their enduring friendship and ever-present rivalry. Their interest in the house had been piqued when they came across an article in the local newspaper noting its sordid past and ghostly legends. It was the haunted house that would ultimately determine the ultimate victor between the two.\n\nErin was sure that this would finally give her the opportunity to prove to Natalie that ghosts were real. The house itself was like something out of a horror novel, its ancient wood groaning and creaking under the weight of some unseen force. The grounds were shrouded in an aura of mystery, drawing her into its haunting depths.\n\nNatalie, however, refused to be swayed by Erin's presumptions. To her, the house was simply an old building with an overgrown garden and an interesting history. The fact that people told ghost stories about it was nothing more than a byproduct of human imagination and fear of the unknown. She was determined to use this opportunity to show Erin that there were rational explanations for every positively chilling detail she would no doubt stumble upon during their investigation.\n\nTogether, the friends entered the house armed with notepads, flashlights, and recording devices. For two nights, they sought paranormal activity in every nook and cranny of the dilapidated home, their eyes peeled for any sign of apparitions or other supernatural phenomena. Erin would gasp and point out cold spots, orbs, and unexplained sounds, while Natalie documented each instance and offered her own natural explanation. Yet, neither the skeptic nor the believer was ready to admit defeat.\n\nOn the third night, they ventured into the dusty attic. The air was heavy with anticipation as they sifted through the piles of forgotten heirlooms. Just as Erin began to lose hope of ever finding definitive proof of the ghostly inhabitants she believed haunted the house, Natalie stumbled upon a mysterious, leather-bound journal.\n\nAlthough she had discovered it by chance, the journal's contents were far from ordinary. In her quest to disprove the paranormal, Natalie had unwittingly stumbled upon the memoir of an occultist who had once lived in the house. As they delved into the troubling confessions of the journal's owner, delusions of grandeur and sinister experiments came to light.\n\nErin and Natalie's friendship evolved as they recognized that the eerie occurrences within the house stemmed from the tenuous line between the paranormal and human psychology. Ultimately, their journey bound them together with a newfound respect for the inexplicable mysteries of the world, as well as the spaces that lay between the realm of the living and the beyond."

When it was rainy, he took the bus. Jerry loved gangster  movies. When a new one came out, he would go to the theatre and watch the new movie three or four times. Jerry would also buy videos at Barney's Video Store. Jerry had a home collection of over 1,000 gangster videos. Old ones, new ones, color, black and white, English, Spanish, Japanese - he loved them all. He could tell you the names, the directors, the stars and all the details of the movies. And then he would invite you to his place to watch a gangster film some time. He was a nice man. Jerry finally decided that he would like to own a gun, just like the gangster. So he saved money for some months. Then he went to a gun store and bought a used revolver  for $ 300. While there, he also bought a lot of bullets . The following Saturday morning, he went to the gun club for only ten minutes when the accident happened. The gun went off, and the bullet went into Jerry's right knee.

It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - The 1999 Skol World Darts Championship was held between 28 December 1998 and 3 January 1999 at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet , Essex . After five years , organisers the Professional Darts Corporation scrapped the group stages and the tournament became a straight knock - out for the first time . The third - place play - off which had been a feature for the previous two years was also abandoned . The field was expanded from 24 to 32 players - the biggest influx of players since the PDC separated from the British Darts Organisation in 1992/93 . Phil Taylor emerged as champion for the fifth successive year , taking his overall tally to seven World Championships . He had now eclipsed both Eric Bristow , who won five World Darts titles and Steve Davis and ( at the time ) Stephen Hendry six times World Snooker champions - both targets of Taylor when he began accumulating world championships .  - Barry Maurice William Hearn (born 19 June 1948) is an English sporting events promoter and the founder and chairman of promotions company Matchroom Sport.  - The M25 or London Orbital Motorway is a motorway that encircles almost all of Greater London, England (with the exception of North Ockendon), in the United Kingdom. An ambitious concept to build four concentric ring roads around London was first mooted in the 1960s. A few sections of the outer two rings were constructed in the early 1970s, but the plan was abandoned and the sections were later integrated to form a single ring which became the M25 and was finally completed in 1986.  - Purfleet is a town in the Thurrock unitary authority in Essex, England. It is contained between the A13 road to the north and the River Thames to the south and is within the easterly bounds of the M25 motorway but just outside the Greater London boundary.

When faced with this issue, most people believe they have no other option but to replace the entire cabinet door. However, replacing the hinges is often a simpler, more cost-effective solution. This article will provide a comprehensive guide on how to replace cabinet hinges efficiently and effectively.\n\nStep 1: Remove the Old Hinge\n\nBefore heading to a home improvement store, begin by taking off your old hinge. Unscrew the hinge from the cabinet door and the frame using a screwdriver or drill. Ensure that you keep the screws in a safe place so you don't lose them. If the holes in the cabinet door or frame are damaged, you may need to fill them in with wood putty and sand them smooth.\n\nStep 2: Finding the Perfect Replacement Hinge\n\nWith your old hinge in hand, visit a local home improvement store for a new hinge. The key is to ensure that the holes for the screws on the new hinge match the distance between those on the old hinge. This will guarantee compatibility and easy installation. Most hinges have standardized hole spacing, but it\u2019s always best to double-check for accuracy. While selecting a hinge, consider the material, finish, and style that matches your existing hardware.\n\nStep 3: Installing the New Hinge on the Cabinet Door\n\nOnce you have acquired the perfect replacement hinge, it's time to install it. Start by attaching the new hinge to the cabinet door using a screwdriver or drill. Tighten the screws securely but be cautious not to overtighten them, as this can cause the wood to crack or split.\n\nStep 4: Aligning the Cabinet Door and Frame\n\nAt this point, it's wise to ask an assistant to help you hold the cabinet door against the frame. Align the door correctly, ensuring that it sits evenly within the frame and that it opens and closes without any obstructions.\n\nStep 5: Securing the New Hinge to the Cabinet Frame\n\nLastly, set the new hinge over the holes for the old hinge in the cabinet frame. Again, use a screwdriver or drill to fix the new hinge securely to the frame. Check the door's alignment one final time and make any necessary adjustments to ensure a perfect fit.\n\nConclusion:\n\nReplacing cabinet hinges need not be a complicated affair. With the right tools, patience, and precision, you can breathe new life into your cabinetry without the unnecessary expense of replacing entire cabinet doors. Moreover, this simple task can significantly improve the appearance and functionality of your cabinets, giving your space a fresh update."

The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.\""

        "value": "An owl has a better depth of field than other types of birds due to a combination of factors including its unique eye and head structure, as well as its specific hunting and foraging needs. In general, birds have different vision characteristics depending on their ecological requirements and behaviors. Owls, being nocturnal predators, possess adaptations that enable them to have a greater depth of field in comparison to other birds, which significantly benefits their hunting abilities.\n\nFirstly, the position of the owl's eyes plays a crucial role in enhancing its depth of field. Unlike many birds that have eyes on the sides of their heads providing a wider visual field, owls have eyes positioned at the front of their heads. This frontal eye placement results in binocular vision, which refers to the overlapping of visual fields from both eyes. This overlap enables owls to perceive depth more effectively and estimate the distance to objects, such as their prey, with a higher degree of accuracy.\n\nSecondly, the anatomy of an owl's eyes contributes to its superior depth of field. Owls' eyes are large and tubular, with a high density of cells called photoreceptors in their retinas. These photoreceptors are particularly sensitive to low-light conditions, allowing owls to see clearly even in near-darkness. This acute night vision is crucial for owls as they primarily hunt during the night when the ability to perceive depth and distance plays a vital role in successfully capturing prey.\n\nIn addition to their unique eye structure, owls have an enhanced focusing ability due to their flexible corneas and lenses, which further contributes to their improved depth of field. This flexibility allows owls to rapidly focus on objects at varying distances, from close-up objects to those further away in their surroundings. This quick focusing ability is essential for owls as they have limited eye movement and rely on their heads to direct their gaze.\n\nAnother factor that contributes to owls' better depth of field is their specialized hunting behavior. Owls are highly adapted to a sit-and-wait hunting strategy, where they perch silently, scanning their surroundings for prey. In this context, the ability to accurately judge distances and depth is crucial for efficient hunting and capturing moving prey in low-light environments.\n\nFurthermore, owls' neck structure enables them to rotate their head up to 270 degrees, giving them an extensive field of view without moving their bodies. This increased range of motion allows owls to maintain their exceptional depth perception across a wide area, further improving their hunting capabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, owls have a better depth of field than other types of birds due to their frontal eye positioning, unique eye anatomy, enhanced focusing ability, specialized hunting behaviors, and neck flexibility. These adaptations work together to provide owls with the necessary depth perception to excel in their nocturnal predatory roles."

In this specific game, which was the fourth in a series of eight, the MLB players emerged victorious with a final score of 7-2. A key contributor to the win was Moises Alou, who played an instrumental role in securing the victory for his team.\n\nMoises Alou, an accomplished MLB player, managed to drive in two crucial runs during the first inning of the game. He achieved this through a timely single hit with the bases loaded, meaning that there were runners on all three bases when he came up to bat. This hit allowed two of these runners to advance and score, giving the MLB team an early lead in the match. This strong start provided significant momentum for the MLB players, who managed to maintain their advantage throughout the game and ultimately secured the win with a five-run margin.\n\nThe context of this exhibition series is important to consider, as it highlights the friendly nature of the competition and serves as a showcase of baseball talent from both nations. The fact that these games are being played outside of the regular season allows the participating athletes to perhaps try new strategies and techniques, as well as to foster camaraderie and goodwill among players from different leagues and nations.\n\nIn conclusion, this text describes a baseball game in which the MLB players defeated the Japanese All-Stars by a score of 7-2, with Moises Alou contributing significantly to this success through his actions in the first inning. The game represents one of a series of exhibition matches aimed at showcasing the skills and talent of both American and Japanese baseball players in a friendly competitive environment."

After the man is kicked out of the office into an empty hallway, the frog begins to sing and dance to \"The Michigan Rag.\" The man eagerly rushes back to let the talent agency employee see, but the frog goes silent before he can show him. Unknown to the man, the frog will only perform for him.Shortly afterwards, the man attempts to try to capitalize on the frog again. Using up all his money, he purchases a theater promoting the frog. However, when the curtain rises, the frog once again refuses to sing. The man shortly thereafter goes bankrupt, and ends up on the streets.One late evening, an officer overhears the frog singing \"Largo al factotum.\" The officer finds the man sitting on the bench with the (now silent) frog.

This causes the officer to arrest the man and have him committed to an asylum.When he finally gets out, the old man sees a new building about to be dedicated.

It discusses performance and results-based management (RBM) as well as providing guidelines related to RBM processes.\n\nResults-Based Management (RBM) is a strategic management approach that focuses on achieving results by consistently improving an organization's performance. It is often implemented by organizations, such as the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), that engage in international development projects. The primary objective of RBM is to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of an organization by setting measurable goals, monitoring progress towards achieving those goals, and adapting strategies and processes as necessary.\n\nKey components of Results-Based Management (RBM):\n\n1. Strategic Planning: The process of defining the organization's vision, mission, and strategic objectives. It also involves identifying the key results and performance indicators that will be used to assess progress towards these objectives.\n\n2. Performance Monitoring: An ongoing process of measuring progress towards the achievement of the organization's objectives and results. This involves tracking performance indicators, reviewing progress reports, and evaluating whether the organization's strategies and actions are leading to the desired outcomes.\n\n3. Evaluation: A systematic assessment of the efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of an organization's programs, projects, or policies. Evaluation data is typically used to inform decision-makers of the success of various initiatives and to guide future planning and resource allocation.\n\n4. Reporting and Accountability: A transparent process of communicating the organization's progress towards achieving its goals to stakeholders, such as donors, governmental bodies, or the public. This may involve the publication of annual performance reports, financial statements, or other relevant documentation.\n\nThe RBM Guidelines would likely contain more detailed information and best practices on how to implement each of these components within the context of the Canadian International Development Agency. By following these guidelines, CIDA aims to improve its overall performance and maximize the impact of its international development efforts."

While it's true that he visited England in 1844 and met another important person there, it's not the right answer to what happened to him after the revolution.

As a result, this increased vegetation might provide some protection against erosion by the ocean due to the plant roots stabilizing the soil and reducing the direct impact of the waves. However, the overall effect of more nutritious soil on the erosion process is complex and depends on various factors such as the type of vegetation, the slope of the coast, and the intensity of the waves.\n\nIn the context of the process described, the second effect mentioned is the energy of the waves pushing water and sediment. If more nutritious soil leads to greater plant growth, which in turn offers some protection against erosion, the direct impact of the waves on the coast may be reduced. This means that the wave energy might have less effect on pushing sediment and eroding the coast.\n\nSo, considering these factors, it is likely that more nutritious soil might have a protective effect against coastal erosion, leading to less influence of the wave energy on sediment movement and a decrease in erosion by the ocean. However, it is essential to note that this is a simplified explanation and that the actual outcome would depend on various specific environmental conditions."

      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "The correct choice is indeed \"mall,\" and here's a detailed explanation as to why:\n\n1. Student union: While a student union may occasionally house bookshops catering to students' needs, these are typically limited to textbooks and reference materials. It wouldn't be the ideal place for a fashion enthusiast to visit after shopping, as it focuses mainly on academic resources rather than a diverse range of books.\n\n2. Mall: A shopping mall is the perfect location for someone interested in both books and fashion, as it caters to diverse retail needs. Malls typically house various clothing stores and at least one or more bookshops, offering a wide assortment of genres and interests. This makes it feasible for individuals to find the latest fashion items and subsequently visit a bookshop within the same vicinity.\n\n3. Department store: Although department stores usually showcase an extensive range of products, they tend not to specialize in books. The book section, if available, might be smaller compared to that of a dedicated bookshop. Therefore, while a department store could be a good place to purchase trendy clothes, it might not necessarily be the best place to find a variety of books.\n\n4. Library: While a library is a fantastic place to browse and borrow books, it's not the right environment for someone looking to purchase the latest fashion. Libraries focus on lending materials rather than selling them, meaning that even if various books are available, the individual won't be able to buy them there.\n\n5. Town or city: Although a town or city might hold several locations where a person can buy both the latest fashion and books, this answer is too broad. Visiting a mall within a town or city would provide a more specific location for both items, as previously explained.\n\nIn conclusion, a mall is an ideal location for someone who wants to visit a bookshop after buying the latest fashion. Malls offer diverse retail experiences that accommodate both fashion enthusiasts and book lovers, making it easy to access a variety of different stores within one convenient location."

In fact, more than 80% of the European scientists between 1450\u20131650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained, of which approximately 45% held university posts. It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development. There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world. However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods. For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction. Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities, and the debates surrounding that adoption, which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change. There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities. Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources.\n\nNow answer this question: The acceptance of new concepts and sciences by universities brought these ideas what?"

Question: Which phone does Kristen use to call James? Title: The Strangers Movie plot: James (Scott Speedman) and his girlfriend Kristen (Liv Tyler) arrive at James' childhood summer home, tired and irritable after a long evening at a friend's wedding reception. It is revealed that while they were there, James proposed to Kristen and she refused, claiming she is not ready for marriage yet. James calls his friend Mike to come pick him up in the morning. Shortly after 4 a.m., there is a knock at the door, surprising to them both since the house is so remote and far from any civilisation for miles. They open the door and a young blonde woman, whose face is obscured by low lighting, is standing on the porch asking for Tamara. When told that she is at the wrong house, she asks if they're sure, then leaves with the casual caveat that she will \"see them later\". Due to the tension between him and Kristen, James leaves to go for a drive and to buy cigarettes. While alone in the house, Kristen hears another knock at the door; she refuses to open it after realising that it is the same woman from earlier, who has returned to ask for Tamara again. She leaves. Kristen then starts hearing strange noises around the outside of the house and her cell phone goes missing. She calls James using the house phone but the line goes dead. The smoke alarm goes off and Kristen disarms it as there is another loud bang on the front door. She goes to the kitchen and grabs a large knife. When she returns, the smoke alarm cover has been placed on one of the chairs, so Kristen knows somebody has been inside. When she hears a noise from the back yard, she goes to the back door and opens the curtains to find a man wearing a sack mask staring back at her. Panicked, she hides in the bedroom until James returns. When James arrives back, she explains what has happened and he goes to investigate. He finds his car ransacked and the blonde woman, now wearing a doll mask, watching him from afar in the street. His phone has had its battery stolen and he realizes the house has been breached. The couple attempt to leave in James's car but a..."

In today's fast-paced society and constant exposure to various media, people often feel saturated with content and subsequently find it difficult to discover new pieces of music that can genuinely complement and augment a special event or occasion. Factors such as personal preferences, cultural influences, and the ever-changing landscape of music genres make it an ongoing challenge to find that perfect track or composition that truly resonates with an individual's emotions and uplifts the atmosphere at any memorable gathering.\n\nVarious streaming platforms and music discovery algorithms, while helpful in providing tailored recommendations, can sometimes overlook less mainstream or niche compositions that might have the potential to captivate an audience. Moreover, the sheer volume of content available can make it overwhelming for listeners to sift through, leading to a reduced chance of uncovering that unique gem of a musical piece.\n\nTo counteract this phenomenon and ensure that one can stumble upon new and enchanting music that enhances a special occasion, several strategies can be employed. Attending live performances, such as concerts, operas, or music festivals, can expose listeners to novel compositions and unique renditions of familiar tracks. Networking with fellow music enthusiasts and joining dedicated online forums or social media groups can lead to sharing and exchanging recommendations, thereby introducing new artists and genres to one's musical repertoire.\n\nInvesting time in exploring less-known artists and genres can increase the likelihood of discovering hidden masterpieces, as a significant portion of these works remain underappreciated and unexplored. Additionally, making an effort to understand the historical context, cultural significance, and intrinsic artistic values behind various musical compositions can lead to a deeper appreciation and connection with the piece, eventually contributing to its ability to enrich a special occasion.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may be challenging to find a new piece of music that truly enhances a special occasion in the current era, taking a proactive approach in exploring diverse musical landscapes, engaging with fellow enthusiasts, and cultivating an appreciation for the varying facets of music and its creators can help uncover riveting and transformative compositions. As one embarks on this musical journey, they are more likely to come across pieces that resonate with their emotions, leaving a lasting impression and elevating the essence of any memorable event."

Understanding this structure is important to assess the missing sentence.\n\nPart #2: Identifying the missing sentence\nUsage: In this context, the missing sentence is \"Bill felt bad for Shelly\".

It is plausible because feeling sorry for Shelly could lead Bill to try to cheer her up by writing a poem.\n\nPart #4: Determining if the given sentence alters the subsequent storyline\nUsage: After inserting the sentence \"Bill felt bad for Shelly\" as the second sentence, the rest of the story continues to make sense, and the logical flow between sentences is not affected. Thus, it does not alter the main storyline.\n\nPart #5: Conveying the conclusion succinctly\nUsage: The instructions ask for a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" response, which means they require a precise answer without any explanations or arguments.

Among the luminaries who judged were Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. The Volta Prize was conceived by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801, and named in honor of Alessandro Volta, with Bell receiving the third grand prize in its history. Since Bell was becoming increasingly affluent, he used his prize money to create endowment funds (the 'Volta Fund') and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington, D.C.. These included the prestigious 'Volta Laboratory Association' (1880), also known as the Volta Laboratory and as the 'Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory', and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau (1887) as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved Edison's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than indenting it, key upgrades that Edison himself later adopted. The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his \"proudest achievement\", \"the photophone\", the \"optical telephone\" which presaged fibre optical telecommunications, while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (the AG Bell), a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness.\n\nQuestion: Which Bell-founded institution still operates in Georgetown today?"

He spent his days pickpocketing unsuspecting tourists and locals, while his nights were spent dreaming of something bigger. In the same city, Rani made her living as a street performer. She had always been attracted to the vibrant energy of Bombay and loved the way it made her feel alive.\n\nAs both of them struggled to make ends meet, fate brought them together on a crowded street corner. Little did they know, their lives were about to change forever.\n\nMeanwhile, in the city of Madras, Raghu lived a simple life with his wife and children. He worked at a small yet prosperous company that provided for his family. Although he was far away from the chaotic world of Bombay, the ties that bound Raja, Rani, and Raghu were stronger than they could have ever imagined.\n\nBack in Bombay, Madhu, one of the employees at Raghu's company, had been misappropriating company funds with the help of her colleague, Manorama. Through an intricate web of deceit and corruption, they managed to steal substantial sums of money without being caught. The stolen money provided them with the means to live a luxurious lifestyle in Bombay, away from the prying eyes of their coworkers in Madras.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Raja's thieving skills ultimately led him to cross paths with Madhu and Manorama. One fateful day, as he was attempting to steal a valuable artifact from an antique store, he stumbled upon information that revealed the money laundering operation. Caught between the desire to enrich himself or expose the nefarious activities, Raja decided to approach Rani for guidance.\n\nTogether, they decided that the ugly truth must come to light. Raja and Rani set off on a journey to Bombay's underbelly, seeking new avenues to bring down Madhu and Manorama's criminal empire. As they navigated the dark and dangerous streets, their partnership developed into a deep bond that withstood the challenges they faced.\n\nWith perseverance, courage, and a little luck, Raja and Rani were successful in their pursuit. Madhu and Manorama were brought to justice, and Raghu's company was saved from the brink of collapse. Through his act of bravery, Raja redeemed himself, leaving his old life of thievery behind. The heartwarming tale of Raja, Rani, and Raghu serves as a testament to the power of second chances and the beauty of forging unexpected connections."

In this context, alarm systems are a crucial element of home security and automation, ensuring safety and convenience for individuals and families.\n\nTo add other devices to your alarm, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the compatible devices: First, check if the devices you want to add are compatible with your alarm system. Most modern alarm systems can connect to various smart home devices like cameras, motion detectors, and smart locks. Consult the user manual or the manufacturer's website to determine which devices are compatible with your alarm system.\n\n2. Acquire the necessary devices: Once you have identified the devices that are compatible with your alarm system, purchase them from a reputable store or online retailer. Ensure that the devices come with an installation guide and the necessary hardware required for mounting.\n\n3. Install the devices: Follow the installation guide provided with each device and mount them in appropriate locations around your home. For instance, security cameras should cover entry points like doors and windows, while motion detectors should be placed in high-traffic areas inside the house.\n\n4. Connect the devices to the alarm system: Upon completing the installation, you need to connect the devices to your alarm system. This process may vary based on the specific alarm system you have. You may need to refer to your alarm system's user manual for detailed instructions on how to connect different devices.\n\n5. Test the devices: After connecting the devices, you must test them to ensure that they are functioning correctly and can communicate with the alarm system. For instance, trigger the motion sensors or activate the cameras to check if they are properly connected to your alarm system. If you encounter any issues during this step, consult the troubleshooting section of the device manual or contact the manufacturer for assistance.\n\n6. Update your settings: Depending on the devices you have added, you may want to adjust the settings of your alarm system to ensure they work effectively. For example, you may need to modify the sensitivity level of motion detectors or adjust the camera's recording options.\n\n7. Integrate with a mobile app or home automation system (optional): If your alarm system allows integration with a mobile app or home automation platform, you could set up the added devices to work with the app. This will enable you to monitor and manage your alarm system remotely, providing you with added convenience and control.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully add other devices to your alarm system, creating a more comprehensive and effective security system for your home."

Considering that you have not specified a specific recipe or purpose, I will provide two reasonable methods: one for a cooked mixture and one for a raw mixture.\n\nMethod 1: Cooked Pumpkin and Egg Mixture (Suitable for baked goods and dishes like pumpkin omelets)\n1. Firstly, prepare the pumpkin by peeling and dicing it into small cubes. If you are using canned pumpkin puree, make sure to have it ready and measured.\n2. In a mixing bowl, crack open the required number of eggs. Ensure that there are no eggshells in the bowl.\n3. Whisk the eggs until the yolks and whites are well combined.\n4. If you are using diced pumpkin, you may need to precook the pumpkin. You can do this by either boiling or steaming the diced pumpkin until it is tender. Alternatively, the pumpkin can be cooked in a skillet over medium heat with a small amount of oil or butter, stirring occasionally, until it is soft.\n5. Once the pumpkin is cooked, fold it into the whisked eggs, making sure the mixture is evenly combined.\n6. If working with pumpkin puree, you can simply add the puree directly to the whisked eggs, combining thoroughly.\n7. If you're using this mixture in a recipe, such as a pumpkin omelet or a breakfast scramble, you can now cook the mixture per the recipe's instructions. \n\nMethod 2: Raw Pumpkin and Egg Mixture (Suitable for recipes like pumpkin pancakes, waffles, and smoothies)\n1. For this method, it is strongly recommended to use pumpkin puree, as it makes it easier to mix with raw eggs. If using fresh pumpkin, cut and remove the skin, and then blend the pumpkin to create a puree.\n2. In a mixing bowl, crack open the required number of eggs. Ensure that there are no eggshells in the bowl.\n3. Whisk the eggs until the yolks and whites are combined.\n4. Add the pumpkin puree into the whisked eggs, making sure to measure out the necessary quantity your recipe requires.\n5. Mix both ingredients thoroughly, ensuring a consistent and smooth mixture.\n6. Your raw pumpkin and egg mixture is now ready to be used in the recipes of your choice, such as pumpkin pancakes, waffles, muffins, or even in smoothies.\n\nBoth methods have their benefits and are suited to specific culinary purposes. Method 1 offers a cooked pumpkin and egg combination, which is ideal for incorporating into recipes like omelets or scrambles, whereas Method 2 provides a raw mixture of pumpkin and egg, making it perfect for use in recipes like pancakes, waffles, and smoothies. Choose the method that aligns best with your intended goal and kitchen needs for the best results."

Therefore, when both vehicles are driven for an hour on the freeway, Mike's truck will have gone a smaller distance compared to his car.\n\nSo, the most sensical answer is (A) truck, as it is the slower vehicle and will have traveled less distance in the given time frame."

Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea\u2019s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China\u2019s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration\u2019s talk of possible military action to end the North\u2019s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is \u201cthe absolute condition for peace.\u201d But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.\n\nQuestion: Electrodes are often glued to what like in EEG studies?"

Fire Authority member Gordon Walker said: 'It is absolutely ridiculous waste of money, particularly when budgets are so tight for public services. All people have to do is use a broom handle or something similar'. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service bought a total of 10,000 of the sticks, at a cost of \u00a31.75 each - a total of \u00a317,500. The sticks are approximately 24in long or just over two foot including the pointing finger. But they were blasted as a 'pointless laughing stock' by some householders.

I'm perplexed as to why Guanabee.com would run a story such as this when they are aware that it is inaccurate.\" \n\nDaniel Mauser, publisher of Guanabee, said his site stands by the story, which resulted after Schwandt was contacted about his role choreographing both the pageant and a much talked-about performance by reality-star-turned-singer Heidi Montag. \n\nWhat are the answers to this following set of questions:\n\n1. What was the controversy over the Miss Universe pageant?\n2. Who said said it was him?\n3. What was Trump's reason for picking them?\n4. Where was this story posted?\n5.

It explains that the desired outcome (benefits) would be optimal or best.\n   \n2. \"It's highly recommended\": The term \"recommended\" conveys advice or a suggestion, while \"highly\" is an intensifier emphasizing the level of recommendation.\n\n3. \"That you purchase from reputable sources\": The necessity for the source of the purchase to be reputable is highlighted here. In purchasing goods or services, a reputable source often implies reliability and legitimacy.\n\n4. \"In the UK\": This location detail conveys that the recommendation is specific to certain geographical constraints, specifically, the United Kingdom.\n\n5. \"That sell Trenbolone\": This closing part of the sentence specifies what product needs to be purchased - Trenbolone. Trenbolone is a potent anabolic steroid frequently used in veterinary medicine and may be familiar to athletes and bodybuilders.\n\nIn conclusion, the revised sentence not only suggests purchasing Trenbolone from a trusted source in the UK, but also emphasizes the importance of this advice by labeling it as 'highly recommended' to ensure the optimal benefits. Always remember that product quality can be drastically affected by the reputation of the source and this might directly impact the benefits of the product."

What this film really is, is...depressing. Depressing that the US film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid, clich\u00e9d re-heats, and acclaim them as spectacular new works. This film as \"retread\" written all over it, from the plot line (an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern-day uber-action) to Smith's character (a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium), to the special effects (that borrowed from Matrix and a few others).\n\n\"I, Robot\" is, sadly, quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialog, and lots and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be Hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has lots of holes in it, of all sizes, but I don't think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice.

If they are a commitment phobe, this may be because they want to see you when they want to see you and don\u2019t want to commit to taking time out of their schedule otherwise. If you make plans, they may cancel, be late, or not show at all. The more time you spend with someone, the more serious the relationship starts to become. If you are with a commitment phobe, when things start to get more serious, they may distance themselves or break it off completely.  Commitment phobes love the excitement of starting to date and then the passion at the beginning of a relationship. After that is over, they lose interest. Commitment phobes only show interest when things are exciting, romantic, or fun. If you try to come to them with problems, they are not interested or understanding. People who are commitment phobic tend to have many short relationships. Casually ask about their relationships. If they divert the topic away, or they have only had short casual flings, the person may be a commitment phobe.  Some people have limited dating experience. This does not mean they are a commitment phobe. There are many factors that lead to someone not dating often. Some commitment phobes have been in long relationships. These usually end with no visible signs of commitment. If you are involved with a commitment phobe, you may have no clue what your relationship actually is. You don\u2019t know if you\u2019re dating, if you\u2019re a couple, or something more. You probably haven\u2019t talked about your relationship or the future. If you bring up what your relationship is, they change the subject, get defensive, or wonder why you want to label what you have. Commitment phobic people have trouble labeling the relationship or their feelings. They may feel uncomfortable with those words because they are too confining or they point to a commitment. If you say the words, they may be uncomfortable or try to explain away why they won\u2019t say the same thing.  For example, these people won\u2019t use terms like girlfriend or boyfriend. They also won\u2019t say that they love you. Try calling the other person your \"boyfriend\" or \"girlfriend\" or say, \"I love you.\" See how they react. However, only do this if you really feel this way about the person. Don\u2019t say \u201cI love you\u201d or put a label on your relationship as a test. People who are commitment phobic may respond in a more sexual way than an emotional way. They are interested in passion and equate intimacy with sex, but not the connection and emotions that can accompany sex. Think about if they only want to be around if you\u2019re going to be sexual. If you want to go out, do something with friends, or mention you\u2019re not interested in having sex on this date, they may not be interested.\nWhat is a summary of what this article is about?"

It was cool and snarky and warm and fuzzy at the same time. It was one of those movies you know you\u2019re going to see again and enjoy just as much the second time around. \n  \n \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy 2\u201d follows the same recipe, from the return of that lovable ragtag band of universe-saviors to the constant bickering and bantering to the \u201cMix Tape\u201d soundtrack of pop-rock hits from the 1970s. (And of course, in the tradition of just about every sequel ever, we\u2019re introduced to new, important characters as well.) \n  \n I\u2019ve always liked the corny, AM-friendly, storytelling hit \u201cBrandy (You\u2019re a Fine Girl)\u201d by Looking Glass. It\u2019s put to good use here, just to the brink of overkill. I\u2019m good with not hearing \u201cBrandy (You\u2019re a Fine Girl)\u201d by Looking Glass until about 2020. \n  \n One of the most impressive special effects in this candy-colored, explosion-riddled, 3-D extravaganza is the appearance of a young Kurt Russell in a 1980 prelude at the top of the story, in which Russell\u2019s character of Ego is romancing Meredith Quill, who will become the mother of Peter Quill/Star-Lord. (Reports say a combination of CGI and makeup and other tricks of the trade gave us the young Kurt. I\u2019d rather not know. It\u2019s just pretty amazing to see what appears to be a 30ish Kurt Russell, awesome \u201980s haircut flowing in the breeze.) \n  \n They\u2019re zipping down the highway, clearly in love, singing along to \u201cBrandy (You\u2019re a Fine Girl)\u201d by Looking Glass. And then Ego shows Meredith a strange orb glowing in the woods, and he talks about his master plan, and \u2026 \n  \n Cut to 34 years later, with the Guardians of the Galaxy gearing up for battle. In addition to Chris Pratt\u2019s wisecracking but noble Peter, there\u2019s Zoe Saldana\u2019s brave (and green) but emotionally cautious Gamora; Dave Bautista\u2019s hulking and ferocious but rather dim and goofy Drax; the sly and outwardly selfish Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and the adorable Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). \n  \n The Guardians get mixed up in all kinds of dangerous intergalactic hijinks interspersed with sticky-sweet sentimental moments. Songs such as Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cThe Chain\u201d and Cat Stevens\u2019 \u201cFather and Son\u201d set the tone (and in some cases hammer home the point). \n  \n At times the special effects are wondrous and cool; other times, they\u2019re so cheesy and obviously CGI one can\u2019t help but wonder if that\u2019s the effect director James Gunn and the army of special effects wizards were trying to achieve. (Scenes on various planets when oozing blue goop spreads across landscapes, apparently killing thousands of humans and other human-like species, are straight out of a B-movie.) \n  \n Michael Rooker has one of the best roles in the movie as Yondu, the infamous space pirate with the blue skin and startlingly horrible teeth and red, Mohawk-like device atop his head. Yondu\u2019s the worst! Or is he? Either way, things liven up quite a bit whenever Yondu starts controlling the deadliest arrow ever by whistling. (Man, Yondu better hope nobody ever stuffs a bunch of crackers down his throat at the wrong moment and quells the whole whistling thing.) \n  \n There\u2019s a whole lot of family dynamic at play, with the vengeful and deeply warped Nebula (Karen Gillan) intent on killing her sister Gamora; Drax establishing some kind of weird sibling kinship with the nice but creepy Mantis (Pom Klementieff), who if anything is even more socially awkward than Drax; and the major unresolved relationship in the story, between Peter and his dad, a celestial being that calls himself Ego and rules a planet (and maybe more than just one planet) of his own creation. \n  \n Chris Pratt and Kurt Russell are terrific together as a father and son who have a lot of baggage to deal with, even in a superhero universe where it sometimes feels as if MOST fathers and sons are dealing with a lot of baggage. As the story gets deeper and darker and more convoluted, it\u2019s hard to care about the particulars of the plot \u2014 especially when the screenplay is constantly reminding us not to take it too seriously, what with the references to David Hasselhoff and \u201cCheers\u201d and Mary Poppins and other pop-culture touchstones. \n  \n Oh, and we haven\u2019t even talked about Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), a golden-skinned warrior princess who leads an army of supposedly perfect creations who are rather terrible at remote-control bombing missions. \n  \n And yet even with all the silliness and all the snarkiness, the Guardians can put a lump in your throat when someone suffers a serious setback, or someone does a solid and risks everything to save someone else. We look forward to the next adventure, with the hopes the Awesome Mix Tape will be the soundtrack for something just a little smarter, a little less bloated, a little more focused. \n  \n \u2605\u2605\u2605 \n  \n Marvel Studios presents a film written and directed by James Gunn. Rated PG-13 (for sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language, and brief suggestive content). Running time: 136 minutes. Opens Friday at local theaters. ||||| Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 \n  \n Director James Gunn narrates a sequence from the film featuring Zoe Saldana and Karen Gillan. \n  \n Starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Michael Rooker, Kurt Russell, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Elizabeth Debicki and Sylvester Stallone. Written and directed by James Gunn. Opens Friday at major theatres. 136 minutes. PG Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 misses a trick with its \u201cawesome mix\u201d of cheesy 1970s pop songs: Andrea True\u2019s 1976 disco hit \u201cMore, More, More\u201d isn\u2019t on the soundtrack. It would have been perfect for a movie deep-diving into franchise formula, by larding in more characters, more plot lines, more explosions and more banter, as if returning writer/director James Gunn is playing cosmic pinball rather than telling a story. \n  \n Article Continued Below \n  \n Just like almost every other blockbuster sequel, in other words, although this property originally sought to blow up convention. It arrived in 2014 smirking at Marvel Comics superhero angst, as its bickering misfits fought intergalactic badness for kicks and cash. But like a visit from amusing friends who stay a bit longer than expected, it\u2019s easy to forgive the indulgence. Vol. 2 sees E.T.-abducted Earthling Peter \u201cStar-Lord\u201d Quill (Chris Pratt), blade-wielding warrior Gamora (Zoe Saldana), tattooed muscleman Drax (Dave Bautista), hybrid handyman Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and adorable offshoot Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) confronting not just an expanded universe of villains but also more complicated family and romantic connections. They\u2019ll be joined, with mixed motives and outcomes both comic and dramatic, by Gamora\u2019s angry adopted sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), insect-faced alien Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and blue-skinned Ravagers bandit Yondu (Michael Rooker), the latter in a significantly enlarged role from the first Guardians, where he played Peter\u2019s crime mentor, surrogate father and nemesis all in one. All of the above has already been revealed in multiple trailers, along with the supposed shocker that Peter\u2019s long-gone birth father is suddenly back in his son\u2019s life. He\u2019s a celestial planet builder aptly called Ego, played by Kurt Russell. He wants to make up for not being there when Peter was grieving his mother\u2019s cancer death and being kidnapped by aliens. \n  \n Frome left, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista and Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper, in a scene from, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 ( Disney-Marvel via AP ) \n  \n The movie opens on Earth in 1980 with the man now called Ego and Peter\u2019s mom-to-be Meredith (Laura Haddock) as they cruise a Missouri highway with the soft-rock hit \u201cBrandy (You\u2019re a Fine Girl)\u201d on the radio, immediately establishing itself as this movie\u2019s main ear worm. \n  \n Jump ahead 34 years and Peter and the other Guardians are fighting a giant space thingie, in a colourfully rendered battle set to Electric Light Orchestra\u2019s \u201cMr. Blue Sky.\u201d They\u2019re also irritating a superior celestial race called the Sovereign, who look like angry Oscar statues and who quickly develop a murderous grudge against the Guardians. Elizabeth Debicki is wonderfully pompous as Ayesha, their diva of a leader. And so it goes with this pinball game of a movie. The Guardians ricochet from one confrontation to another, some involving galaxy-saving and others just affairs of the heart \u2014 such as whether Peter and Gamora are ever going to acknowledge this love thing they feel coming on. \n  \n Article Continued Below \n  \n Fortunately, Gunn is savvy enough not to let the proceedings or the characters get too serious or too sappy. He punctures Ego\u2019s balloon in one scene by having him interrupt his bloviating with a need to urinate. In another, Ego explains to Peter why \u201cBrandy\u201d is Earth\u2019s finest song ever, which is like that moment in Dumb and Dumber when Jim Carrey says the Beatles were a huge influence on the Monkees. So even if the gags go on too long \u2014 the David Hasselhoff and Cheers references are just plain goofy \u2014 and the cheeseball soundtrack isn\u2019t quite the retro joy it was three years ago, these Guardians are still worth hanging with, if only to marvel at the imaginative characters and production design. To those who disagree, I quote the knuckleheaded but weirdly profound Drax: \u201cYou Earthlings have hang-ups.\u201d ||||| Disney/Marvel \n  \n What an oddball corner of the Marvel space-time continuum the Guardians of the Galaxy occupy! They can do quantum leaps between interstellar dimensions while bopping to carefree \u201970s dance-pop on a cassette player. They battle big, bad aliens while name-checking Mary Poppins and David Hasselhoff, and discuss their complicated interpersonal relationships through references to Sam and Diane from \u201cCheers.\u201d Their high-flying dogfights happen amid audiovisual arcade game nods to Galaga and Pac-Man. \n  \n Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 out of 4 stars Rating: PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language and brief suggestive content. \n  \n You don\u2019t get more back to the future than this wholehearted embrace of sci-fi and golden oldies nostalgia. No franchise is so gifted at exploiting the popularity of superhero movies while satirizing the genre. \u201cDeadpool\u201d was too over the R-rated top. \u201cAnt-Man\u201d was too small-scale for non-geeks. \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d is just right. It\u2019s hyperbolic nonsense wrapped in the colors of a neon rainbow, bouncing from one artfully wacky scenario to the next. Here it\u2019s sleekly futuristic, there it\u2019s older than mud. It\u2019s the galaxy\u2019s silliest thrill show. \n  \n The film continues the threads we saw formed in the Guardians\u2019 initial appearance as small-time mercenaries turned halfhearted defenders of the universe. We know that Peter Quill, aka Star Lord, is a cocky swashbuckler with a neurotic core, the kind of fixable bad boy Chris Pratt was born to play. \n  \n Zoe Saldana is his female counterpart as Gamora, a hard-fighting green gladiatrix with an ornery streak and a tendency to tell the girlfriend-craving Peter to drop the mushy stuff because such a thing as romance between their species could never happen for real anyway. \n  \n Dave Bautista\u2019s Drax is a comically plain-spoken goliath, now trying to understand humor and laughing at every wrong moment. Vin Diesel has his deep bass tuned to a squeak in voicing Groot, the massive walking extraterrestrial tree that was felled and returned to life as a cute little humanoid twig, while Rocket the genetically enhanced raccoon (spoken by Bradley Cooper) remains as abrasive as an electric grinder. His interest in once again staving off Armageddon is purely financial: \u201cWe\u2019re really gonna be able to jack up our prices if we\u2019re two-time Galaxy savers!\u201d \n  \n The threats arrive on jumbled story lines. A society of gold-colored tech nerds attack the Guardians for running off with a bag of priceless light bulbs. Gamora\u2019s jealous sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) arrives to prove she\u2019s the family\u2019s most efficient assassin by killing her sibling. A space army of Ravagers led by blue-skinned Yondu (Michael Rooker), who snatched young, orphaned Peter from Earth and became his shady papa figure, comes after them to settle scores of their own. Meanwhile, in a nearby subplot, Peter meets Ego (Kurt Russell), the universal life force that actually created him. Peter and Ego have a heart-to-heart while interpreting the lyrics to Cat Stevens\u2019 \u201cFather and Son,\u201d giving the maudlin song a feeling of real pathos. \n  \n Drax (Dave Bautista) and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) flying high in \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2.\" \n  \n Written and directed again with tongue-in-cheek flair by James Gunn (of \u201cSlither\u201d and \u201cSuper\u201d fame), this is first-rate goofy escapism. While the mentality and much of the dialogue is adolescent again, this time the adventure includes some interesting concepts and emotional undercurrents, adding a neat bonus of heart. Russell gives a nuanced turn as Ego reveals where the root word for egomania came from. Russell moves through Ego\u2019s lifelong neglect of Peter, to his amiable warmth, and then his mercurial storming as if Ego were a classic alcoholic father. \n  \n Of course there are oooh-and-aaah-worthy special effects, but they\u2019re not the entire story. \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d is touching and bawdy, violent and hilarious, glamorous and goofy. It\u2019s as close as comic book movies come to being all things to all people. ||||| Correction: A previous version on this review incorrectly described the planet of Berhert. The story has been updated. \n  \n  \n  \n From left, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Star-Lord/Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) reprise their roles in Marvel\u2019s \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\u201d It\u2019s more expansive, more beautiful, funnier and nuttier than the first film \u2014 and it features another great soundtrack. (Film Frame/Marvel Studios) \n  \n With a title slyly evoking the music-compilation aesthetic embodied by its 1970s-hit-heavy sound track, \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d manages to re-create the formula of self-aware, snarky humor and unapologetic action that made the original 2014 film such a pleasing package of ear and eye candy, while at the same time avoiding the sophomore slump of sequels that risk audience fatigue by repeating rather than building on what worked the first time. The new film is more expansive, more beautiful, funnier, nuttier and \u2014 this is the most difficult trick for any comic-book movie to pull off \u2014 more touching than the first film. \n  \n The team of five quarrelsome superheroes returns intact, or mostly intact, with the barely articulate tree-man Groot having been reduced, at the end of the last film, to the sapling-size Baby Groot, still voiced by Vin Diesel, but as if he were exhaling helium from a party balloon. And the film kicks off like a party, with an opening credit sequence featuring Groot shaking his adorably twiggy booty to Electric Light Orchestra\u2019s \u201cMr. Blue Sky\u201d on a boombox as Chris Pratt\u2019s Peter \u201cStar-Lord\u201d Quill, Zoe Saldana\u2019s Gamora, Dave Bautista\u2019s Drax and Bradley Cooper\u2019s CGI raccoon Rocket do battle with an alien starbeast intent on attacking the Anulax batteries they have been hired to protect. \n  \n Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). (Film Frame/Marvel Studios) \n  \n The Guardians may be mercenaries, but they\u2019re far from all business, occasionally pausing to queue up one of Peter\u2019s favorite tracks as a sonic backdrop to the impending action. (The filmmakers, led by returning director and co-writer James Gunn, also oblige, as in the film\u2019s tour-de-force set piece: a scene featuring mass killing, set to \u201cCome a Little Bit Closer\u201d by Jay and the Americans, as a flying arrow on autopilot \u2014 the signature weapon of Michael Rooker\u2019s Yondu the Ravager \u2014 pierces through multiple bodies over the course of the tonally inappropriate yet perfectly curated song.) \n  \n That\u2019s not the only dazzling visual, in this sharply \u00adchoreographed and ravishingly designed comedic space opera. One scene, featuring Gamora\u2019s green body, silhouetted against a red landscape, is so painterly pretty, a la \u201cAvatar\u2019s\u201d moon of Pandora, that my eyes hurt \u2014 in a good way. \n  \n The real story doesn\u2019t get underway until our \u00adethically tarnished heroes \u2014 having stolen some of the same batteries they had previously been guarding against theft \u2014 crash-land on the planet of Berhert. There, Peter meets his long-lost father, the appro\u00adpriately named Ego (Kurt Russell), leading to what appears to be a tender family reunion \u2014 and striking a tone that will characterize the rest of the film, much of which takes place on Ego\u2019s home planet. Family \u2014 the kind that is defined by blood, and the kind for whom you will spill blood, even without sharing DNA \u2014 is the theme of this tale, which manages to evoke genuine, deep feelings, along with belly laughs. \n  \n Much of the film\u2019s humor has to do with stupidity resulting from efforts to look cool. One villain character, who has given himself the moniker Taserface (Chris Sullivan of \u201cThis Is Us\u201d), is mocked repeatedly for the \u00adineffectuality of his meant-to-be-threatening handle. In another scene, Peter compares Yondu \u2014 his surrogate father, who raised him as a child \u2014 to Mary \u00adPoppins, as Yondu descends from the sky, like the famous nanny, \u00adholding his arrow aloft like her umbrella. \u201cMary Poppins? Is he cool?\u201d asks the clueless Yondu. \n  \n Yes, Mary Poppins is cool, Peter reassures him, with an implied wink to the audience. Winks, of a more literal variety, are a recurring sight gag, as the cynical Rocket tries, unsuccessfully, to signal his sarcastic digs, by repeatedly batting the one eye that everyone can see. \n  \n \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d suffers from no such fatal exertions. Gunn, whose film includes more world building than the original movie \u2014 and the introduction of a charming new character, the buglike empath Mantis (Pom Klementieff) \u2014 delivers backstory, story and the promise of stories to come with the breezy, effortless skill of a master raconteur. \n  \n This is not a superhero movie in the ponderous mold of DC Comics\u2019s \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d or even its fellow Marvel movies centering on Captain America and the Avengers. Falling somewhere \u00adbetween the sardonicism of the \u201cIron Man\u201d trilogy and the self-aware meta-movie high jinks of the R-rated yuk-fest \u201cDeadpool,\u201d \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d is a toe-tapping, eye-popping indication that summer is here, and that it might not be so bad after all. |||||\nWhat is a shorter version of the above article?"

Just like in the first movie, there's a group of funny, weird characters who have to save the universe. Oh, and there's plenty of awesome music from the 1970s!\n\nThe movie follows the same pattern as the first one, with all the lovable characters coming back and even some new ones introduced. There's action, silliness, and a bit of emotion thrown in, making it a great movie to watch even if it's not as fresh as the first one.

Plus, there's a lot of bickering and arguing among the characters, which is funny to watch. \n\nOne of the main storylines is about Peter, a character played by Chris Pratt, finding his long-lost father. There's a lot of references to old music, movies, and TV shows too. And of course, there's a ton of crazy space battles and other action scenes that make this movie a whole lot of fun!"

        "value": "- Shrubland, scrubland, scrub or brush is a plant community characterised by vegetation dominated by shrubs, often also including grasses, herbs, and geophytes. Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity. It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire. A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or browsing. Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire. The term \"shrubland\" was first coined in 1903.  - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18\u00b0 south and 20\u00b0 south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.  - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.  - The Amazon basin is the part of South America drained by the Amazon River and its tributaries. The Amazon drainage basin covers an area of about , or roughly 40 percent of the South American continent. It is located in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela.  - Anthony 's nightjar ( Nyctidromus anthonyi ) , also known as the scrub nightjar , is a species of nightjar in the Caprimulgidae family . It is found in western Ecuador and north - western Peru . Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry shrubland .  - Caprimulgus is a large and very widespread genus of nightjars, medium-sized nocturnal birds with long pointed wings, short legs and short bills. \"Caprimulgus\" is derived from the Latin \"capra\", \"nanny goat\", and \"mulgere\", \"to milk\", referring to an old myth that nightjars suck milk from goats. The common name \"nightjar\", first recorded in 1630, refers to the nocturnal habits of the bird, the second part of the name deriving from the distinctive churring song.  - A nighthawk is a nocturnal bird of the subfamily Chordeilinae, within the nightjar family, Caprimulgidae. The term \"nighthawk\", first recorded in the King James Version of 1611, was originally a local name in England for the European nightjar. Its use in the Americas refers to members of the genus \"Chordeiles\" and related genera was first recorded in 1778.   - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas.  - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez, Salas y G\u00f3mez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.  - Crepuscular animals are those that are active primarily during twilight (i.e., the period immediately after dawn and that immediately before dusk). It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset.  - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2\u00a0m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - A plant community (sometimes \"phytocoenosis\" or \"phytocenosis\") is a collection or association of plant species within a designated geographical unit, which forms a relatively uniform patch, distinguishable from neighboring patches of different vegetation types. The components of each plant community are influenced by soil type, topography, climate and human disturbance. In many cases there are several soil types within a given phytocoenosis.   - The number and type of plants, how leafy they are, and how healthy they are. In places where foliage is dense and plants are growing quickly, the index is high, represented in dark green. Regions where few plants grow have a low vegetation index, shown in tan. The index is based on measurements taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAs Terra satellite. Areas where the satellite did not collect data are gray.  - Peru , officially the Republic of Peru, is a country in western South America. It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the west by the Pacific Ocean. Peru is an extremely biodiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river.  - Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal or crepuscular birds in the family Caprimulgidae, characterized by long wings, short legs and very short bills. They are sometimes called goatsuckers, due to the ancient folk tale that they sucked the milk from goats (the Latin for goatsucker is \"Caprimulgus\"). Some New World species are called nighthawks. Nightjars usually nest on the ground.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - A population is the number of all the organisms of the same group or species, which live in a particular geographical area, and have the capability of interbreeding.

This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may be later released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store that has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars created these atoms.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What hinders plate tectonics and may lift mountains via orogenesis?"

        "value": "The question can be rephrased to better understand what factors affect plate tectonics and orogenesis:\n\nWhat factors hinder or influence plate tectonics and the formation of mountains through orogenesis?\n\nVarious factors affect plate tectonics and orogenesis. Some of these include:\n\n1. Temperature differences: The Earth's core releases heat through radioactive decay, driving thermal convection in the mantle. This convection, in turn, influences the movement of tectonic plates. If temperatures in the mantle were uniform, the driving force behind plate tectonics would be diminished.\n\n2. Plate thickness and buoyancy: Plates that are thicker and more buoyant may resist subduction (when one tectonic plate moves under another) and may hinder the processes that lead to orogenesis. Conversely, thinner and denser plates are more likely to be subducted, contributing to the formation of mountains.\n\n3. Plate boundaries and interactions: The type of boundary where two plates meet influences the types of geological processes that can occur. For example, at convergent boundaries, where two plates collide, orogenesis is likely to occur. In contrast, divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart, generally do not lead to the formation of mountains.\n\n4. Geological history and preexisting structures: The previous geological history of a region may affect the current state of plate tectonics and orogenesis. For example, preexisting faults or weak zones in the Earth's crust may promote the formation of mountains or the motion of tectonic plates.\n\n5. Rates of erosion and sedimentation: Erosion can remove material from the Earth's surface, reducing the mass of overlying rock and potentially influencing tectonic processes. Conversely, the accumulation of sediment may increase the mass on the Earth's crust and contribute to orogenesis.\n\nThese factors, among others, influence plate tectonics and the formation of mountains through orogenesis."

Any club can put a bid in, and they will be independently audited against a defined set of criteria. If they are successful, they will be included in Scotland's list of elite academies.\"\nProject Brave's recommendations:\nThe working group for the strategy was formed in March last year, and initiated by Mackay's predecessor, Brian McClair.\nClubs that do not meet the eligibility criteria for Club Academy Scotland status - and central funding - will still have access to funding from the SFA to enable them to continue running their academies.\n\"We want to make sure that we get the best support to help us manage the migration to our new academy system,\" Regan told the SFA website.\n\"We have identified an organisation from Europe, Double Pass, who work with a number of key countries, including the FAs in England, Belgium, and others in Scandinavia.\n\"They will be coming on board sometime in 2017 to start the auditing process to establish whether club academies meet the criteria we set out, and will be continually reviewing academies into next year to make sure they are the standard we need.\"\nIn his first major task since succeeding McClair in December, Mackay will give presentations to member clubs in the academy programme at events at St Johnstone, Kilmarnock, Oriam and Hampden Park. Club feedback will then be incorporated into the final report before Project Brave becomes operational at the start of season 2017/18."

At least that's the gist of a report released earlier this week by economists at the Hudson Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank based in Washington, D.C.\n\nMoreover, the report skewers union leaders for funding their own pension plans better than those made available to rank-and-file members.\n\nOrganized labor's reaction to the report? \"In a word, 'Yawn,'\" says Stephen Lerner, special assistant to the president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). \"Because of greedy CEOs on Wall Street and at big banks, our stock market lost half its value, and pension funds--union and corporate--took a hit.\"\n\nThe Hudson report's broad comparison of funding status among different types of plans was based on 2006 data--so it's not altogether clear how the recent market turmoil might have affected the disparity between so-called Taft-Hartley (union-negotiated) pension plans and employer-sponsored private sector plans.\n\nThat aside, the numbers seem to speak for themselves: 35% of non-union plans with 100 or more participants were fully funded, vs. just 17% of collectively bargained plans of the same size. Only 14% of non-union plans were less than 80% funded, vs. 41% of union plans. Just 1% of non-union plans had less than 65% funding, vs. 13% of collectively bargained plans.\n\nHeading into the recession, leaders at large unions continued to make grandiose promises to rank-and-file members regarding benefits and then sunk funds into risky investments in a bid to make up the gap between the amounts on-hand and those needed to cover their commitments, according to Hudson Institute study authors Diana Furchtgott-Roth and Andrew Brown.\n\nFor example, assets at the Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund lagged throughout the mid-2000s as the costs of benefits climbed. By 2007, the plan had 62% of assets in equities. By the end of 2008, that equity portfolio had lost 39% of its value. Now the fund has had to cancel lump-sum payments, deny cost-of-living adjustments to new retirees and reduce early retirement benefits.\n\nMeanwhile, unions gave at least $250 million to political candidates over the course of the 2008 federal election cycle. While they can't use compulsory dues for political purposes, that hasn't stopped union leaders from strongly encouraging members to donate certain amounts each month to union campaign contribution chests, the Hudson Institute report claims.\n\nWhy the current need to get so much money to Capitol Hill? To support a pending bill called the Employee Free Choice Act, Furchtgott-Roth and Brown suggest. Legislators are still hashing out the details, but one union goal in the bill is a provision that would force employers into binding arbitration with unions if a bargaining session doesn't result in a contract agreement within four months, the Hudson economists say.\n\n\"Unions want [binding] arbitration because they believe that the threat of arbitration, followed by the arbitration itself, will force employers to offer better compensation packages in the initial bargaining,\" the report states. \"Employers oppose [mandatory] arbitration on the grounds that it could require them to pay excessive compensation to workers and impose upon them onerous union work rules, eventually forcing them out of business.\"\n\nThe SEIU's Lerner says his organization supports \"the Employee Free Choice Act as a much-needed check on unbridled corporate power that continues to hurt workers.\""

I guess I just need to give myself some time and explore my options more before making a decision.\n\nAnne: Exactly! And don't hesitate to talk to professors, attend career fairs, or even do internships. There will be plenty of opportunities to help guide you towards the right direction.\n\nDialog Conclusion:\n\nStephen: Thanks, Anne. I really needed to hear that.

Ray has also spent time in the af2, as well as spending time on the New York Jets roster in the National Football League. He is most well known for his performance with the Edmonton Eskimos, as he is the franchise's all-time leader in passing yardage, pass completions and passing touchdowns.  - The Toronto Argonauts are a professional Canadian football team competing in the East Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Based in Toronto, Ontario, the team was founded in 1873, and is the oldest existing professional sports team in North America still using its original name. The team's origins date back to a modified version of rugby football that emerged in North America in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The Argonauts played their home games at Rogers Centre from 1989 until 2016 when the team moved to BMO Field, the fifth stadium site to host the team. The current team is coached by Scott Milanovich and led at quarterback by Ricky Ray.  - Rugby is a type of football developed at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. The two main types of rugby are rugby league and rugby union. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports.  - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area .

Opened in 1989 on the former Railway Lands, it is home to the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). Previously, the stadium served as home to the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL) played an annual game at the stadium as part of the Bills Toronto Series from 2008 to 2013. While it is primarily a sports venue, it also hosts other large-scale events such as conventions, trade fairs, concerts, travelling carnivals, and monster truck shows.  - A sports league is a group of sports teams or individual athletes that compete against each other in a specific sport. At its simplest, it may be a local group of amateur athletes who form teams among themselves and compete on weekends; at its most complex, it can be an international professional league making large amounts of money and involving dozens of teams and thousands of players.  - The Grey Cup is the name of both the championship game of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the trophy awarded to the victorious team playing Canadian football. It is contested between the winners of the CFL's East and West Divisional playoffs and is one of Canadian television's largest annual sporting events. The Toronto Argonauts have 16 championships, more than any other team. The latest, the 104th Grey Cup, took place in Toronto, Ontario, on November 27, 2016, when the Ottawa Redblacks defeated the Calgary Stampeders 3933 in overtime.  - The Hamilton Tiger-Cats are a professional Canadian football team based in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, founded in 1950 with the merger of the Hamilton Tigers and the Hamilton Wildcats.

The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs.

The Atlas II was a key element of the United States' space program and served as a reliable means to launch satellites and other payloads into orbit.\n\n2. Physical attribute: The sentence provides information about the physical dimensions of the Atlas II, specifically that it has a diameter of 3.04 meters. This information is crucial to understanding the overall size of the launch vehicle, as well as how it compares to other types of launch vehicles.\n\n3. Launch sites: There are two launch sites mentioned in the sentence, namely the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (Florida, USA) and the Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 3 (California, USA). These locations were where the Atlas II was launched during its operational history, and they are important sites for space launches in the United States.\n\n4. Last flight date: The sentence specifically states that March 16, 1998, was the last flight of the Atlas II. This information is significant because it offers context about the timeline of the Atlas II program, which was active from the early 1990s until the late 1990s.\n\n5. Implied use: Although the sentence does not directly state the purpose of the Atlas II, we can infer that it was designed to launch payloads such as satellites into orbit. This is due to several factors, including the association with other similar space launch vehicles and the launch sites mentioned, which were known for satellite and payload launches.\n\nIn summary, from this sentence, we can extract information about the Atlas II's dimensions, launch sites, last flight date, and implied use. This data provides valuable context about the Atlas II as a crucial part of the United States' space program during the 1990s and offers a snapshot of its role in satellite launches and other space-related missions."

This adds to the negative sentiment, as it shows the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the film's overall quality. The only positive aspect mentioned is that people who like watching Pacino and the other principal actors might enjoy the movie, but even this is presented in a rather negative light, indicating that it's not enough to save the film from disappointment.\n\nIn summary, the sentiment of this passage is primarily negative, with the reviewer criticizing various aspects of the film, such as the script, direction, character development, and emotional investment. The few positive aspects mentioned, such as the performances of the principal actors, are not enough to change the overall sentiment."

        "value": "Richard Melville Hall (born September 11, 1965), better known by his stage name Moby, is an American musician, DJ, record producer, singer, songwriter, photographer and animal rights activist. He is well known for his electronic music, veganism and support of animal rights. Moby has sold over 20 million records worldwide. AllMusic considers him \"one of the most important dance music figures of the early 1990s, helping bring the music to a mainstream audience both in the UK and in America\".\n\nIn January 2010, Moby announced that he was to begin working on his next record. He said \"the mood for this record will be more acoustic and less electronic than before\". Around this time Moby started a heavy metal band with his friend Phil Costello, Diamondsnake, getting back to his roots. Diamondsnake released two albums on Facebook.  On February 15, 2011, Moby announced the release of his new album, Destroyed. It was released on May 16, 2011. A photography book with the same name was also released around the time of the album.  \"Musically\", he said, \"it's very melodic and atmospheric and electronic, and if i had to sum it up i would describe it as: 'broken down melodic electronic music for empty cities at 2 a.m'.\" The album cover, which was released with the new information, was taken in LaGuardia Airport. It is a picture of a sign that reads 'destroyed', part of the longer phrase \"All unclaimed baggage will be destroyed.\" The album consists of 15 tracks, one of them previously featured on the compilation A Night in NYC, titled \"Rockets\". Along with the album's announcement came the release of the EP Be the One, which contains 3 of the tracks from Destroyed The EP was released free for those who signed up for Moby's mailing list. For the next single, Moby put a poll on his website for fans to choose which single should be released next, and it came to be \"Lie Down in Darkness\".  On August 30, Moby posted another request for the third official single, this time asking fans to say which should be next, without a poll. After this, he announced the following day through his Twitter that the next singles are \"After\" and \"The Right Thing\".  On April 30, 2012, Moby released Destroyed Remixed, a limited edition 2CD collection of remixes of songs from the 2011 studio album, Destroyed. The release included three new exclusive remixes by David Lynch, Holy Ghost!, and System Divine, and also featured a brand new 30 minute ambient track by Moby called 'All Sides Gone'. Compiled and mixed by Moby, Destroyed Remixed was described as 'an eclectic mix of some the most exciting and interesting artists and DJ's in contemporary music'.  Between February and August 2013, Moby performed both acoustic and DJ sets at the Wanderlust Festival, which hosted events in Hawaii, Vermont, California and Colorado in the United States, and also in Canada and Chile internationally. He added a single Asia performance date at the 1 World Music Festival in Singapore. Moby also performed two 75-minute DJ sets at the Coachella festival in April which featured a unique visual collaboration with NASA, with various images from space projected onto screens during the performance. Moby followed-up with another DJ set at the Movement Detroit festival in May.  For Record Store Day 2013, Moby released a 7-inch record called The Lonely Night which featured former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan. An accompanying video was created by Colin Rich, of which Moby stated: \"I'm really excited to have an experimental music video from this great video artist, and I feel like the slow, rich, and languorous desert visuals fit the song perfectly.\" The track was subsequently released as a download with remixes by Photek, Gregor Tresher, Freescha and Moby himself.  In July, Moby announced that he would be releasing a new studio album entitled Innocents. The album had been written and recorded in the previous 18 months and was due for release in October. The album was recorded in Moby's apartment and features a number of guest vocalists, in keeping with earlier releases such as Play, 18 and Wait For Me. As with Destroyed, the photographs comprising the album's artwork were all shot by Moby. The first official single from the album is titled A Case for Shame while the previously released track The Lonely Night will also appear on Innocents. The album was produced by Grammy-winner Mark 'Spike' Stent. It was later revealed in August that The Perfect Life, which features Wayne Coyne, would be the next single, after a casting call for a music video was announced, calling \"for obese Speedo-sporting bikers, nude rollerskating ghosts, and an S&M gimp proficient in rhythmic gymnastics\"  Moby performed a DJ set in Las Vegas on September 1, before flying to Australia to DJ at an intimate show in Sydney, on the 19th. Moby will then DJ at the 10th annual Decibel Festival in Seattle. He then returned to Los Angeles to perform three shows at the Fonda Theatre on October 3-5 to promote the album, which would be his only \"full live shows\" for 2013 and 2014.  Moby stated that the reason for doing little to no touring for this album was that \"when I go on tour I sit around a lot (cars, airports, hotels, etc), and when I sit around I can't spend my time making music. And pretty much all I want to do in life is stay home and make music. So, thus: a 3 date world tour.\"  He conceded that he might return to world touring in the future.  Starting in around 2001, Moby launched a series of co-owned business ventures, with the two most prominent being the \"Little Idiot Collective\"--a New York City, U.S. bricks-and-mortar clothing store, comics store, and animation studio that sold the work of an \"illustrators collective\"--and a small restaurant and tea shop called Teany. Teany was cofounded in 2002 with his ex-girlfriend Kelly Tisdale. In a November 2006 interview, at which time he had removed himself from any previous business projects.  In November 2015 Moby opened the Vegan bistro Little Pine in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The restaurant serves organic, vegan, Mediterranean-inspired dishes and has a retail section with art and books, curated by Moby himself.  Moby's vision was to create a space that includes various aspects of society that he cares about. All of the restaurant's profits are donated to animal welfare organizations.  On August 23rd 2016 Moby announced the inaugural Circle V Festival along with the official video for 'Don't Leave Me' by Moby & The Void Pacific Choir.  The event took place at LA's Fonda Theatre and featured Blaqk Audio & Cold Cave on the bill amongst others in the evening and talks and vegan food stalls in the afternoon. Moby described Circle V as \"the coming together of my life's work, animal rights and music. I couldn't be more excited about this event and am so proud to be head-lining.\"  The second Circle V event took place on November 18th this time at The Regent Theatre in Los Angeles. Moby headlined the event for the second year with artists Waka Flocka Flame, Dreamcar and Raury featuring on the bill.\n\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What are Moby's business ventures?"

Question: What tries to prevent the rest of the group from flying to safety? Title: The Cyclops Movie plot: The movie opens with credits and title over a black background. The setting is Guayjorm, Mexico. Inside an administration building is Susan Winter (Gloria Talbott). She is asking for permission from the Governor (Vincente Padula) to fly over a restricted area of his state--the Tarahumare Mountains. She explains that she has been planning three years to rescue her fianc\u00e9e, Bruce Barton, whose airplane crashed in the area. The Governor asks about her colleagues and their reasons for helping. Despite her best efforts, the Governor is adamant--the answer is no. To make sure his orders are followed he tells her he will place a police escort on the plane. As their airplane is a four place model, this means someone must stay behind.Russ Bradford (James Craig) is at a magazine stand trying to buy a sports magazine. He doesn't speak Spanish and the salesgirl (Marlene Kloss) doesn't speak English. He joins the pilot, Lee Brand (Tom Drake) and Marty Melville (Lon Chaney, Jr.) at an outdoor table for lunch. They are waiting for Susan to return from her meeting with the Governor. Susan arrives and joins them at the table. They ask how things went. She responds, \"I couldn't do a thing with the Governor.\" Lee doesn't think there will be any problems. He has a plan for the security escort. They drive out to the landing strip and are met by a policeman (Manuel Lopez). Lee gets in the airplane and starts the engine. It would appear that Marty will stay behind as Russ and Susan board the plane. Marty lures the policeman away from the plane, a Stinson Voyager, and then decks him and boards. The prop wash wakes the policeman and he fires at the departing airplane. The tower calls the plane and orders it to return to the field. Against orders, they continue their flight towards the restricted area of the Tarahumare Mountains. During the flight, Marty explains his reason for financing part of the trip, namely Uranium exploration. Marty brought a scintillator to locate his claim. When the scintillator tops out the airplane..."

The charismatic leader made his way onto the MS Berlin cruise ship, his eyes scanning the crowd, finally landing on Marita Lorenz. Little did she know that this serendipitous encounter would change her life forever, leading her down a path filled with love, intrigue, and danger.\n\nThe connection between Lorenz and Castro was immediate and intense. As they spent more and more time together, Lorenz found herself drawn into Castro's world, a world that was vastly different from her life in New York City. Before long, the affair between the two blossomed, and Lorenz found herself living in Havana, swept up in the excitement of the Cuban Revolution and the man at its center.\n\nDespite the passion of their relationship, Lorenz's position as Castro's mistress placed her squarely on the CIA's radar. The United States government, alarmed by the growing influence of communism in the Western Hemisphere, was determined to undermine Castro's regime. They sought to exploit the unwitting Lorenz and her proximity to Castro to achieve this goal.\n\nIn 1960, the CIA approached Lorenz with a shocking proposition: to assassinate Fidel Castro using poison pills concealed in her face cream. The young woman found herself trapped between love for Castro and pressure from the CIA, torn between loyalty to the man who had captured her heart and allegiance to her home country.\n\nAs Lorenz stood at the crossroads of history, she faced the most difficult decision of her life, one that could alter the course of the Cuban Revolution and her own destiny. In that moment, the fateful meeting between Marita Lorenz and Fidel Castro aboard the MS Berlin in Havana harbor took on even greater significance, setting in motion a chain of events that would forever change their lives, their nations, and the world itself."

If you already have a license from another state, you will not have to take the written or driving tests to get a Florida license. For the record, you have 30 days after filing the Declaration of Domicile to get a Florida driver's license (you may get a Florida license with or without this declaration, which we\u2019ll discuss in the second section). To get your license:  Bring your out-of-state license to your local Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (county tax collector). Take an identify document with you too, such as the original or certified copy of your birth certificate.  It's also okay to bring a US Passport, or a Certificate of Naturalization. Provide proof of your Social Security number. This could be your Social Security card, a W-2 or pay stub. Offer two documents that prove your Florida address. A mortgage deed, Florida car registration or recent utility bills are the most commonly accepted, but anything with your new address should suffice. If you don\u2019t intend to drive, you need to get a Non-Driver ID card. This is the same exact process as getting a Driver\u2019s License (without any tests, of course). Transfer your car title and get registration for your car \u2018\u2019in Florida\u2019\u2019. You have 10 days after establishing Florida residency status to complete this task.  Get car insurance in Florida. Submit proof of your policy to the county tax collector. Show the original title to the county tax collector. Bring the car you want to register to your county tax collector's office, so they can check out the VIN. Pay the fees. It costs around $400 to title and register your car for the first time in Florida. You will also have to pay the typical registration fees, which vary depending the age, type, and weight of your vehicle. It is convenient to do this while getting your Florida driver's license  \u2013 often at the DMV (county tax collector) they will attach a voter registration form along with your new address forms. However, you can also register with the Supervisor of Election. You must wait until the voter registration books open, as they close 30 days prior to an election and reopen after an election. This is a simple form that takes about 5 minutes to fill out. After you hand it in, your work is done. It's as simple as that!"

In 1984, she was the first female vice presidential candidate representing a major American political party. Ferraro grew up in New York City and worked as a public school teacher before training as a lawyer. She joined the Queens County District Attorney's Office in 1974, heading the new Special Victims Bureau that dealt with sex crimes, child abuse, and domestic violence.\n\nIn February 1996, Ferraro joined the high-visibility CNN political talk show Crossfire, as the co-host representing the \"from the left\" vantage. She kept her brassy, rapid-fire speech and New York accent intact, and her trial experience from her prosecutor days was a good fit for the program's format. She sparred effectively with \"from the right\" co-host Pat Buchanan, for whom she developed a personal liking. The show stayed strong in ratings for CNN, and the job was lucrative. She welcomed how the role \"keeps me visible [and] keeps me extremely well informed on the issues.\"  At the start of 1998, Ferraro left Crossfire and ran for the Democratic nomination again in the 1998 United States Senate election in New York. The other candidates were Congressman Charles Schumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green. She had done no fundraising, out of fear of conflict of interest with her Crossfire job, but was nonetheless immediately perceived as the front-runner. Indeed, December and January polls had her 25 percentage points ahead of Green in the race and even further ahead of Schumer. Unlike the previous campaigns, her family finances never became an issue. However, she lost ground during the summer, with Schumer catching up in the polls by early August and then soon passing her. Schumer, a tireless fundraiser, outspent her by a five-to-one margin, and Ferraro failed to establish a political image current with the times. In the September 15, 1998 primary, she was beaten soundly by Schumer by a 51 percent to 26 percent margin. Unlike 1992, the contest was not divisive, and Ferraro and third-place finisher Green endorsed Schumer at a unity breakfast the following day. Schumer would go on to decisively unseat D'Amato in the general election.  The 1998 primary defeat brought an end to Ferraro's political career. The New York Times wrote at the time: \"If Ms. Ferraro's rise was meteoric, her political career's denouement was protracted, often agonizing and, at first glance, baffling.\" She still retained admirers, though. Anita Perez Ferguson, president of the National Women's Political Caucus, noted that female New York political figures in the past had been reluctant to enter the state's notoriously fierce primary races, and said: \"This woman has probably been more of an opinion maker than most people sitting for six terms straight in the House of Representatives or Senate. Her attempts, and even her losses, have accomplished far beyond what others have accomplished by winning.\"\n\nWas she popular on CNN?"

As a result, Crossfire maintained strong ratings for CNN and became a lucrative job for her.\n\nFerraro's role on the show not only kept her visible in the public eye but also allowed her to stay well informed on various political issues. Despite her political career ending after losing the 1998 Democratic primary for the United States Senate election in New York, Ferraro continued to be a respected and influential figure in politics. Her time on CNN's Crossfire was a significant part of her career and contributed to her visibility and popularity among viewers."

Article: It is often necessary to release a fish, that is, set it free after catching, because it is too small, or you just don't want to take it home to eat. In some cases, releasing fish is a good measure that will help keep fish variety and build their population size. The Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (DGIF) encourages fishermen who practice catch-and-release fishing to use a few simple skills when doing so. The advice provided below will help make sure that the fish you release will survive   to bite again another day. --When catching a fish, play it quickly and keep the fish in the water as much as possible. Don't' use a net in landing the fish and release it quickly to prevent it from dying. --Hold the fish gently. Do not put your fingers in its eyes. Don't wipe the scales   off the   fish because it might cause it to develop a disease and reduce its chance of survival. --Remove your hook   quickly. If the hook is too deep or hooked in the stomach, cut the   line and leave the hook in. The hook left inside will cause no serious problem to the fish. --Take good care of the fish by moving it gently in water . Release the fish when it begins to   struggle and is able to swim. --Do not hold fish in a bucket or some other containers and later decide to release it. If you are   going to release a fish, do so right away. With a little care and by following the suggestions given above, you can give the released fish a better chance of survival. Question: What is the purpose of the test? - To show how to enjoy fishing. - To persuade people to fish less often. - To encourage people to set fish free. - To give advice on how to release fish."

This attribute may be appreciated by the target audience and be perceived positively. \n\nHowever, the latter part of the sentence, \"but scarcely nourishing,\" implies that the movie might lack depth, substance, or emotional impact.

By using the word \"scarcely\" before \"nourishing,\" the reviewer expresses that the movie falls short in providing these qualities. This part of the sentence conveys the negative sentiment of the review.\n\nTaking both parts of the sentence into consideration, it can be concluded that the sentiment of this movie review statement reveals mixed feelings - acknowledging that the movie may be easy to watch but ultimately pointing out that it lacks depth and substance, which leads to a more negative overall sentiment."

So we get (-301 + 317) * v = 160. \n\nIf we do the math inside the parentheses first (-301 + 317), we get 16. Our new equation now looks like this: 16 * v = 160.\n\nNow, we want to find out what v is, so we'll divide both sides of the equation by 16. This will help us find v.\n\nSo, let's do this: (16 * v) / 16 = 160 / 16.\n\nSince 16 divided by 16 equals 1, we're left with: v = 10.\n\nThere you go, buddy! The answer is v = 10."

Since the sound loop is only about 5 minutes long and the disc is an hour we get treated to this disruption repeatedly. While it's not an outboard motor, there's just no reason it had to be included in a \"Sounds of Nature\" CD.There are undoubtedly better environmental CDs available."

We lost to Toulon and Saracens and beat Scarlets but it takes its toll,\" Diamond said.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Manchester, he continued: \"The problem is that in the domestic league, that's where your bread and butter is. In a competition that has relegation, one thing you can't afford to do as a franchise is get relegated.\n\"So all your intentions are good in all competitions but you've really got to put the hard graft in and make sure you stay in the league and we did that comfortably.\"\nDespite Sale not finishing in the top four of the Premiership since their title-winning 2005-06 season, Diamond believes he can bring success to the north west.\n\"A lot of people's ambition is to finish in Europe. Mine isn't to do that, it's to manage to be in the top four [of the Premiership],\" he added.\n\"With the investment that's gone in this year, we've got to see ourselves being a regular top-four side in the next three or four years.\n\"There's no doubt we can do that. We run a business that doesn't lose any money. The sides that traditionally finish below us lose around \u00a38-9m. We don't lose anything.\"\n\nA summary of the above article is?"

How to Solve Problems.\" This sentence appears to be a title or heading that introduces a section or chapter discussing the concept of the three brains and how they can be utilized to approach problem-solving.\n\nTo further elaborate on this concept, the idea of having three brains is based on the Triune Brain model proposed by Dr. Paul MacLean, a neuroscientist from the United States. According to his theory, the human brain consists of three distinct but interconnected sections, each with its own specialized functions:\n\n1. The Reptilian Brain (brainstem and cerebellum) - This is the oldest and most primitive part of the brain, responsible for basic survival instincts, such as self-preservation, territorial defense, and reproduction. It is also in charge of autonomic functions, including heart rate, breathing, and body temperature regulation.\n\n2. The Mammalian Brain (limbic system) - Also known as the emotional brain, it is responsible for processing and regulating emotions, forming memories, and managing basic social behaviors. Key structures within the mammalian brain include the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and thalamus.\n\n3. The Neocortex (cerebral cortex) - The neocortex is the most evolved and largest part of the human brain. It is responsible for complex cognitive functions, such as perception, awareness, decision-making, reasoning, language, creativity, and problem-solving. The neocortex is further divided into four distinct lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital), each responsible for specific functions.\n\nIn the context of \"The Three Brains. How to Solve Problems,\" the idea is to understand the functions of each part of the triune brain and learn how to harness their capabilities effectively to approach and solve problems. This involves recognizing the roles that instinct, emotions, and higher cognitive processes play in decision-making and problem-solving, and learning strategies to integrate these different aspects of the brain to achieve optimal outcomes. Some approaches may include mindfulness practices, emotional intelligence training, or cognitive reframing techniques, among others."

This can be done by dividing both sides of the equation by -5. \n\nThis gives us k = 15 / -5 \n\nStep 4: Simplify the right side to find the solution to the equation.\nAfter simplifying, the value of k would be -3\n\nJustification:\nEach step involves applying basic principles of algebra to simplify the equation and solve for k. By combining like terms, we can simplify the equation to a form that can be easily solved. Dividing both sides by the coefficient of k allows us to isolate k. Finally, simplifying the right side gives us the solution to the equation."

By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair. However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, \"might not have jumped to the notion of a chair\", but instead \"might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape.\" This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. Moreover, animals do the same thing. Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog \"would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such.\" In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

It becomes apparent that their encounter is not coincidental, but rather a pre-arranged meeting to engage in a friendly bout of traditional Japanese sumo wrestling.\n\nAs the sumo wrestler nears his opponent, they both bow out of respect, following the customs ingrained in the centuries-old sport. Stepping into the makeshift dohyo, or sumo ring, they form a circle in the soft earth, stretching and warming up in preparation for their match. A small crowd gathers, composed of friends and passersby who have caught wind of the competition. Their eager eyes and supportive cheers heighten the excitement that now fills the air.\n\nThough the other man is not a professional sumo wrestler, he adopts the shikiri, or crouch position, mirroring the sumo wrestler's stance. Their eyes locked on each other's, they wait patiently for the right moment to strike. A brief yet tense silence ensues, broken only by the distant rustling of the wind through the trees.\n\nSuddenly, the sumo wrestler lunges forward with a powerful burst of speed, attempting to push his opponent out of the ring. The other man, seizing the opportunity, pivots to one side, using the sumo wrestler's momentum against him. Surprised by his opponent's nimbleness, the sumo wrestler quickly adjusts and reengages, this time more cautious of his adversary's abilities.\n\nThey continue to grapple and push against each other, their bodies slick with sweat that glistens in the sun. Both men give their all, showcasing incredible strength, agility, and determination. The intensity of the bout draws the onlookers even closer, excited gasps and exclamations punctuating the sounds of their heavy breaths and mighty shoves.\n\nAt last, the sumo wrestler manages to grip the other man's mawashi, the cloth belt traditional sumo wrestlers wear. He deftly lifts his opponent off the ground and carries him out of the ring, securing his victory. Both competitors collapse to the ground, exhausted but with evident satisfaction in their eyes.\n\nOnce they've caught their breath, the sumo wrestler and his opponent rise to their feet. They exchange bows and warm smiles, acknowledging the other's talent and perseverance. The small crowd applauds their sportsmanship, just as impressed by their display of honor and camaraderie as by their wrestling prowess.\n\nAs the excitement dies down, the two men continue to chat, their newfound friendship forged in the heat of friendly competition. They share stories of their lives and discuss their mutual passion for sumo wrestling, eager to learn from one another. As the sun begins to set over the field, they depart, each richer for having taken part in this unexpected and exhilarating encounter."

        "value": "If you missed your chance earlier this year to rent that popular replica of van Gogh\u2019s bedroom, you may now fight other art enthusiasts to win a much cooler opportunity: one night for two in Edward Hopper\u2019s real, first bedroom. It will also be a unique experience to occur next spring, won through a public auction recently launched by The Edward Hopper House Art Center, the nonprofit that has cared for the artist\u2019s old home since 1971. \n  \n This is the first time the Edward Hopper House has allowed members of the public to live in the two-story building since its top floor was rented as an apartment in the \u201970s. Built by the artist\u2019s grandfather, the building now has a spot on the National Register of Historic Places. It\u2019s also where Hopper\u2019s creativity first flourished and where he produced many artworks until he turned 28 and moved to New York. \n  \n His bedroom window offers views of the Hudson River, which inspired many of his early seascapes; the strong sunlight that greeted him in the morning also influenced how he rendered light in many of his artworks. For a forthcoming exhibition, Hopper\u2019s room has also undergone a slight makeover from how it typically appears to visitors : interior designer Ernest de la Torre and architect Walter Cain have reimagined the space in period style, filling it with additional props after studying the painter\u2019s early drawings and paintings of his bedroom. \n  \n Before you get too excited about a quick getaway in the historic setting, though, take note: bids will likely reach staggering numbers particularly since the auction is raising funds to benefit arts education in local schools and student studio space at the House. The online event ends on the morning of October 15, with a live auction occurring in the afternoon. As of press time, only two parties have placed bids, with the leading figure standing at $650. But aside from purchasing the honor of sleeping in Hopper\u2019s original bed (size: full), peeing in his former toilet, and strolling alone in his gardens, the winner will also enjoy a dinner at a restaurant and breakfast in the house. \n  \n And for those with hygiene on their mind, don\u2019t worry: the museum assures that Hopper\u2019s bed will be fitted with a brand new mattress. ||||| Do you wish you could live the life of one of history\u2019s greatest painters? Get out your brushes and your wallet: As Sarah Cascone reports for ArtNet News, fans of the American realist can bid on the chance to stay in a recreation of Edward Hopper\u2019s bedroom in his Nyack, New York, house\u2014a room the artist himself immortalized in some of his early paintings. \n  \n Hopper was born in 1882 and he grew up in the Nyack house where he lived until 1910. His bedroom wasn\u2019t just a place where the young artist snoozed. Rather, it influenced his work. The house and the bedroom overlook the Hudson River, which cast its light into his living space every day. The \u201cHudson River light\u201d was known for its clarity and intensity, which attracted some of America\u2019s greatest landscape painters to the area. Hopper went on to be influenced by the Hudson River School of painters, who flocked to places like Nyack to depict its fields and waters. Inspired by the boats and rocks he could see from his window and around his house, Hopper honed his artistic skills. \n  \n The artist's house fell into disrepair after Hopper died in 1967, and it was slated for destruction until it was saved by fans. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and now is known as Edward Hopper House Art Center, a non-profit art center that preserves Hopper\u2019s legacy, showcases his work and offers workshops and classes for art lovers. \n  \n Interior designer Ernest de la Torre and architect Walter Cain used one of Hopper\u2019s studies of his own bedroom around 1905 to recreate his room in period style. The second-story bedroom includes Hopper\u2019s own bedframe, writes Cascone (don\u2019t worry, the mattress is new) and a self-portrait of the young artist he painted in 1905-1906. \n  \n So far, the auction, which will benefit local arts programs, has garnered $650 in bids. The winner can stay in the room with one other guest and includes dinner and a garden breakfast. Bidding will end on October 15 in a live event. \n  \n Can\u2019t afford to live like Hopper? The restaged room\u2019s open for visitors, too, so take a peek next time you\u2019re near NYC. The house has also made a walking tour of Nyack available as well, for those who want to go deeper into Hopper's life by exploring his boyhood haunts. ||||| Edward Hopper fans, get your bidding paddles ready. The Edward Hopper House Art Center is auctioning off the chance for two lucky art lovers to spend the night in the artist\u2019s bedroom in Nyack, New York. \n  \n The museum, where Hopper lived until he was 28, has recreated the historic bedroom in situ. Based on the artist\u2019s early drawings and paintings of the room, interior designer Ernest de la Torre and architect Walter Cain have done their best to return the space to its former appearance with period-appropriate furniture and decor. \n  \n Related: At the Art Institute of Chicago You Can Spend the Night in Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s \u2018Bedroom\u2019 \n  \n Guests can peer out of the windows to the Hudson River below, which is credited with providing much artistic inspiration to the young artist. Hopper\u2019s original full-size bed frame will be there, albeit with a brand new mattress for the occasion. \n  \n The residence, on the National Register of Historic Places, is now a museum and arts center, and has not had overnight visitors since the 1970s, when the top floor was rented out to tenants. The overnight stay will be the highlight of the current exhibition, \u201cEdward Hopper\u2019s Bedroom Reimagined,\u201d on view through the end of May. \n  \n Related: Edward Hopper Etching Hits High Mark for Print Sale Online \n  \n The bidding is open online through October 15, and is currently at just $650.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, \u00a3121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\", and writing: Some minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling. From 1988 to 2000, the two western towers..."

He smoked the rocks he didn\u2019t sell and often appeared as strung out as his customers.\n\nBut in 2008, he moved into a $400,000 house, started driving a champagne-colored Humvee, and made himself the star act of his own hip-hop label. He abandoned the crack business. Found something better, he told associates.\n\nWhat he found was OxyContin from Southern California, where organized drug rings were colluding with rogue doctors and pharmacies to obtain enormous quantities of the drug.\n\nIllicit OxyContin devastated the entire Everett region. At the height of the drug\u2019s popularity, it was a factor in more than half of the crimes in Snohomish County. Abuse of the drug touched off an epidemic of painkiller and heroin addiction, which continues to this day.\n\nThe crisis swept up many young people, such as Katie McKnight, the daughter of an Everett physician whose dependency outlasted seven trips to rehab, and Brandon Smith, who lost a promising career at Nintendo and, ultimately, his freedom to OxyContin.\n\nAn Inland Empire branch of the Crips trafficked pills out of L.A. and by plane. The destination was Everett, Wash.\n\nAuthorities in Everett knew much ofthe drug was coming from traffickers in the Los Angeles area, but they were unable to determine how pills were getting on the black market. A Times review of court records and law enforcement reports suggests that several people who sent OxyContin from Southern California to Lawson in Everett were buying pills from Lake Medical, a clinic near MacArthur Park that was a front for a drug ring.\n\nThe records, along with interviews of law enforcement officials, indicate that Inland Empire Crips gang members drove bags of OxyContin north on Interstate 5 to Washington State and sent couriers aboard planes to Seattle with pills strapped to their bodies.\n\nAt the time OxyContin was ravaging Everett, Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, was tracking the voluminous prescriptions written by Lake Medical\u2019s doctors as well as the extraordinary quantities of pills ordered by corrupt pharmacies filling those prescriptions. It did not track Lake Medical pills to their final destinations, however.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until years later, after authorities brought down the ring, that Purdue shared the information with law enforcement. By then, 1.1 million pills had spilled onto the black market.\n\nEverett, a city of 100,000, hugs Port Gardner Bay about halfway between Seattle and the Canadian border. Ferries crisscross the blue-gray waters of Puget Sound; the snowcapped Cascades rise behind the modest skyline.\n\nA thriving mill town at the turn of the 20th century, Everett has seen its fortunes rise and fall with various industries \u2014 shipbuilding, lumber, iron and canneries. The largest employers today are Boeing, which assembles four types of airliners at a plant along Interstate 5, and the U.S. Navy, which has a deep-water port on the north end of town.\n\nThe region had long grappled with methamphetamine abuse. But with the California pills flowing to Lawson, OxyContin became the community\u2019s most pressing drug problem.\n\nLawson wasn\u2019t shy about the source of his new wealth.\n\nHe wore a pendant necklace with a map of the West Coast in diamonds and a trail of gems the color of 80-milligram OxyContin connecting Los Angeles and Washington state.\n\nHe sold the 80-milligram tablets \u2014 the maximum-strength pill favored by addicts \u2014 in bulk to local gangs that used small-time dealers to peddle them for up to $80 a piece.\n\nDealers sold pills in parks, outside grocery stores and at car washes. The aluminum foil that addicts used to smoke the pills littered parking lots and sidewalks. Some grocery stores gave away foil squares to discourage the rampant shoplifting of Reynolds Wrap.\n\nAddicts burglarized homes, picked pockets, stole identities, robbed businesses and prostituted themselves. Young women in pasties and thongs offered sexual favors alongside lattes at a proliferation of drive-in \u201cbikini\u201d espresso stands.\n\nOxyContin seemed to attract people with no criminal records and stable homes, jobs, and families.\n\n\u201cThey were a segment of society you would never have anticipated,\u201d said Coleen St. Clair, a former Snohomish County prosecuting attorney who worked in the narcotics unit.\n\nKatie McKnight was smart and beautiful, a gifted athlete and the daughter of an Everett internist. A friend had given her a pill in 2006 during her first year at a local community college and, in the words of her mother, Mary, \u201cthat was it.\u201d\n\nTo buy pills, the young woman stole her sister\u2019s graduation money, her parents\u2019 checkbook and, twice, her mother\u2019s engagement ring. She tried to snatch a woman\u2019s purse in a grocery store parking lot, shoplifted and, for a time, worked as a stripper.\n\nHer father was familiar with OxyContin, but in his many years at a busy city clinic, he had never come across a patient who required a maximum-strength dose. He struggled to comprehend how his daughter was getting her hands on large numbers of 80-milligram tablets.\n\n\u201cIt seemed so completely outside the realm of possibility,\u201d Robert McKnight said.\n\nWhen Lawson began dealing OxyContin in Everett, the 24-year-old had finished a year in prison for theft and her parents were doing everything they could to help her stay sober. They let her move back into her childhood bedroom, drove her to 12-step meetings and supported her efforts to find a job.\n\nBut Katie relapsed, often spending nights at a motel where, the authorities said, dealers connected to Lawson sold 80s in the parking lot.\n\nOn one car ride to a treatment center, her mother recalled, Katie studied her reflection in the visor mirror. After several long moments, she said quietly to herself, \u201cI am so broken.\u201d\n\nTo Brandon Smith, who worked in marketing for Nintendo, OxyContin seemed less a dangerous narcotic than a status symbol. The popular crowd openly smoked the \u201cgreen beans\u201d on pieces of foil.\n\n\u201cIt was socially acceptable,\u201d said Smith, who lived near Everett. \u201cIt was almost the new weed.\u201d\n\nSmith became addicted, then got clean for a time. But in January 2009, at the age of 24, he relapsed. The flood of OxyContin into Everett had driven down prices and more people than ever were selling.\n\nBy the summer of 2009, Smith had a $150-a-day habit. He\u2019d been forced out of his job for stealing. He\u2019d spent his 401(k) and sold his belongings. On a July afternoon, he was out of cash and going into withdrawal. He saw only one way out. He walked into a tanning salon near Everett and pointed a gun at a clerk.\n\n\u201cGive me all your money,\u201d he told her.\n\nHe committed another robbery later that day. And the next. And the next. The cashiers didn\u2019t notice the gun was a fake. What they did remember was that the man holding it was polite and apologized as he left.\n\nTwo weeks into the 2009 spree, a local TV news program broadcast surveillance video of the \u201cTanning Salon Bandit.\u201d Smith\u2019s mother, watching at home, immediately recognized her son and phoned police.\n\nOfficers surrounded him as he left his apartment the next morning. As they trained their weapons on him, he would later recall, he felt a brief sense of confusion. \u201cIt\u2019s just me, guys,\u201d he remembered thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s just Brandon.\u201d\n\nSmith confessed to at least 17 robberies. He was sentenced to 14 years in state prison, where he remains today.\n\n\u201cI never meant to hurt anyone,\u201d he told detectives. \u201cOne thing led to another.\u201d\n\nWorking OxyContin cases for the Snohomish Regional Drug Task Force, Det. Nicole Richardson spent many of her days talking to addicts and their families.\n\n\u201cIt impacted probably every aspect of the local community,\u201d Richardson recalled. \u201cA couple of individuals with the right connections in California flooded the Snohomish County market and unfortunately made a huge problem.\u201d\n\nInvestigators in Everett arrested Jevon Lawson in 2010, about the same time an L.A. drug task force was closing in on members of the Lake Medical ring. Federal prosecutors in L.A. won convictions of the clinic leaders while their counterparts in Seattle successfully prosecuted Lawson and several Californians supplying him with OxyContin.\n\nIn Everett, Jevon \u201cGoldie\u201d Lawson bought bags of pills from L.A. gangmembers. He sold them to local dealers in Mill Creek and other places around the region.\n\nA defendant in one of the Washington state cases, a San Bernardino woman who pleaded guilty to laundering nearly $1 million as part of a conspiracy to supply OxyContin to Lawson, had purchased large quantities of OxyContin pills from Lake Medical, according to a DEA analyst\u2019s report and an informant\u2019s statement to authorities.\n\nThe prosecutors did not allege in court that the OxyContin in Everett came specifically from the Lake Medical ring, and internal Purdue emails reviewed by The Times did not indicate that Purdue knew of a connection.\n\nUltimately, the authorities in Everett built their case against Lawson and his associates with old-fashioned police work \u2014 surveilling drug spots, working informants and carrying out buy-and-bust operations.

Addicts could no longer smoke the pills, but many of them moved to heroin, which is chemically similar and cheaper.\n\nDealers who had been selling heroin to the same small group of drug users for years suddenly found themselves with a booming new clientele of, as one former dealer from Everett recalled, \u201cupper- and middle-class children.\u201d Today, heroin addiction is a public health crisis in Snohomish County; more than 40 residents fatally overdose each year.\n\nKatie McKnight had used heroin and other drugs when she couldn\u2019t afford OxyContin, but after the pill reformulation, she became a full-time intravenous heroin user.\n\nIn the fall of 2011, she was living in a squalid apartment with a drug dealer boyfriend and praying for sobriety.\n\n\u201cGod please give me some kind of way to get into detox to get the help I need to kick the dependence and have my life back,\u201d she wrote in pink cursive in her journal on Oct. 1, 2011. \u201cI seriously feel like I\u2019m slowly dying. I need help!\u201d\n\nNineteen days later, she overdosed in her apartment. Her parents stood outside in the cold, misty darkness for an hour while paramedics worked to revive her.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. \u201cWhen we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,\u201d Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, \u201cThere is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.\u201d But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements. Pompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements. The secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. After the summit,... Who did Trump meet with representing North Korea? - not enough information - Mike Pompeo - Taro Kono - Kim Jong Un"

A decade after the incident, K\u1ef3 described Taylor as \"the sort of man who addressed people rather than talked to them\", referencing the confrontation.

How could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into 'getting things done', behaved like a viceroy?\" However, Thi also took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said \"Because this is one of the happiest days of my life ...

This project, led by Royal Skousen, utilized the gathered fragments of the Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon and applied advanced photographic techniques to obtain fine readings from otherwise unreadable pages and fragments.\n\nThe original manuscript of the Book of Mormon was written by various scribes as Joseph Smith dictated his translation. Over time, parts of the manuscript experienced damage or were lost due to various factors such as exposure to the elements and improper storage. The remaining fragments, some of which are in private hands or held by institutions, have been vital in enabling this project to restore the text of the Book of Mormon. The availability of these fragments has enabled researchers to understand better the textual changes that may have occurred through copying, editing, and printing processes.\n\nThe project's use of advanced photographic techniques allows for a greater understanding of the text, even when the physical condition of the manuscript fragments is not optimal. These techniques include ultraviolet photography, which can reveal text that is invisible to the naked eye due to ink deterioration or other factors. By applying these techniques, researchers can glean valuable information from the fragments and establish a clearer understanding of the text's wording, spelling, and punctuation.\n\nIn conclusion, the Critical Text of the Book of Mormon Project utilized the gathered fragments of the Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon and employed advanced photographic techniques to obtain fine readings from otherwise unreadable pages and fragments. This project is crucial in establishing a more accurate representation of the original English text of the Book of Mormon."

Thus some current of changing water flows through them. On the other hand, a river is an example of flowing water. In some places, however, a river may have such a slow current that it is very difficult to detect. Standing inland waters differ in size, in age, and in many _ environmental characteristics. They range in size from roadside puddles to the Caspian Sea. Puddles may last for only a few days or weeks; ponds, for a few hundred to a thousand years. In general, lakes are older, though the waters of some tropical \"lakes\" disappear completely during each dry season. Standing waters vary from very shallow to very deep, from clear to muddy, from fresh to salty. In flowing waters we roughly distinguish between brooks, creeks, and rivers.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday. In a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted. Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department. \"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy. A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday. But Democrats said the question would have the opposite effect \u2014 discouraging undocumented immigrants and citizen family members from responding to the census, undermining the accuracy of the results. \"We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020 \u2014 too much is at stake,\" Rep.

His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496).

Lee and producer Will Packer. \u201cNight School,\u201d however, didn\u2019t garner the same critical praise as \u201cGirls Trip.\u201d It generated a low 31% average on Rotten Tomatoes, whereas \u201cGirls Trip\u201d boasts a 90% certified fresh rating. \n  \n With \u201cNight School,\u201d Universal now holds the three biggest original comedic openings of the past two years, along with \u201cBlockers\u201d and \u201cGirls Trip.\u201d The studio\u2019s head of domestic distribution, Jim Orr, attributes the success to the team both in front of and behind the camera. \n  \n Related \u2018First Man\u2019 Tops Studios\u2019 TV Ad Spending Kevin Hart on 'Night School,' the 'Jumanji' Sequel and Why He Wants to Direct \n  \n \u201cWe\u2019re in business with the right people,\u201d Orr said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t begin to give enough love to Kevin Hart, Tiffany Haddish, Malcolm Lee, and Will Packer.\u201d \n  \n \u201cNight School\u201d looks to be another win for Haddish, who continues to prove her big screen bankability. That\u2019s good news for studios since the comedian has a slew of titles hitting multiplexes in the coming months. The comedic dynamo has \u201cThe Oath\u201d with Ike Barinholtz, Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cNobody\u2019s Fool,\u201d and a voice role in Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cThe Lego Movie 2\u201d on the horizon. \n  \n \u201c ,\u201d which features the ensemble voice cast of Channing Tatum, James Corden, Common, LeBron James, and Zendaya, is another movie aimed at younger audiences to resonate in recent weeks. Karey Kirkpatrick, known for his work on \u201cJames and the Giant Peach,\u201d \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web,\u201d and \u201cOver the Hedge,\u201d co-wrote and directed the animated pic, which carries an $80 million budget. \n  \n Jack Black and Cate Blanchett\u2019s kid-friendly fantasy film \u201cThe House With a Clock in Its Walls\u201d notched third place. It picked up another $12.5 million in its second outing, bringing its North American tally to $44.7 million. Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cA Simple Favor,\u201d starring Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively, scared up $6.5 million in its third frame to nab the No. 4 slot. The neo-noir drama has earned $42.9 million to date. \n  \n Rounding out the top five is Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cThe Nun,\u201d which summoned another $5.4 million for a domestic total of $109 million. \u201cThe Nun\u201d is officially the highest-grossing installment in the \u201cConjuring\u201d franchise. \n  \n \u201cThere\u2019s just an angle of it that really delivers to horror fans,\u201d Warner Bros.\u2019 head of domestic distribution Jeff Goldstein said. \u201cIn the \u2018Conjuring\u2019 universe, there\u2019s so much street cred among the fanbase.\u201d \n  \n The weekend\u2019s other wide release is Lionsgate and CBS Films\u2019 \u201cHell Fest.\u201d The low-budget horror movie launched with $5 million from 2,297 theaters. \u201cParanormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension\u201d director Gregory Plotkin, who also worked on \u201cHappy Death Day,\u201d handled filmmaking duties. \n  \n A slew of indie titles opened at the speciality box office. National Geographic\u2019s \u201cFree Solo,\u201d a documentary about the first free solo rock climb of Yosemite\u2019s El Capitan, earned the best screen average of the year. It launched with $300,804 in four theaters, translating to $75,201 per location. \n  \n Fox Searchlight\u2019s \u201cThe Old Man and the Gun\u201d pocketed $150,000 when it opened in five theaters. Robert Redford stars alongside Casey Affleck in the larcenous comedy based on a New Yorker article about an octogenarian bank robber. \n  \n Meanwhile Neon\u2019s \u201cMonsters and Men,\u201d with John David Washington and \u201cHamilton\u201d alum Anthony Ramos, bowed with $130,979 when it played on 18 screens. ||||| New animated pic 'Smallfoot' opens to a solid $23 million, while National Geographic's doc 'Free Solo' soars to record-breaking numbers at the specialty box office ahead of Robert Redford's 'Old Man & the Gun.' \n  \n Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish's raucous comedy Night School laughed its way to the top of the box-office chart, beating the overall comedy curse in opening to $28 million from 3,010 theaters. \n  \n The film reunites director Malcolm D. Lee, producer Will Packer and Universal, the winning trio behind the 2017 box-office hit Girls Trip, which debuted to $31 million in summer 2017. Thanks to an ethnically diverse audience, Night School scored the best debut for a broad comedy since Girls Trip. Another exception to the comedy slump is Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M. Chu's rom-com that opened to $26.5 million in August on its way to earning nearly $220 million globally. \n  \n Heading into the weekend, some tracking services suggested Night School \u2014 cementing Haddish's star status after her breakout role in Girls Trip \u2014 could clear $31 million in its domestic launch. One hitch may have been generally weak reviews; Night School bears a 31 percent Rotten Tomatoes score, compared to 90 percent for Girls Trip. \n  \n Lee's latest comedy, which earned a far better A- CinemaScore from audiences, follows a group of misfits who are forced to attend night school in order to pass their GED exams (Haddish plays their teacher). Rob Riggle, Taran Killam, Romany Malco and Keith David round out the cast. In addition to starring, Hart is among the producers. \n  \n Caucasians made up 37 percent of ticket buyers, followed by African-Americans (30 percent), Hispanics (24 percent), Asian (5 percent) and other (4 percent), according to Universal. \n  \n Overseas, Night School launched to $5.5 million from its first 19 markets for $33.5 million globally. \n  \n \u201cWorking with some of the funniest comedic talent in the business today with Kevin and Tiffany, pairing them with two filmmakers at the top of their game in Malcolm and Will, and you have a movie that checks all of the boxes for which audiences clearly turned out,\" says Universal domestic distribution chief Jim Orr. \n  \n Thanks to solid family turnout, Warner Bros.' new animated offering Smallfoot opened in second place with $23 million from 4,131 theaters. The movie, whose voice cast includes Channing Tatum and LeBron James, likewise earned an A- CinemaScore. Nearly half the audience was under the age of 25. \n  \n Co-written and directed by Karey Kirkpatrick, Smallfoot follows a group of Yeti who encounter a human (neither can believe the other is real). James Corden, Zendaya, Common, Gina Rodriguez, Danny DeVito and Yara Shahidi also lend their voices. Internationally, Smallfoot took in $14 million from 49 markets for a total bow of $37 million. \n  \n Smallfoot no doubt took a bite out of Amblin and Universal's family offering, The House With a Clock in Its Walls, which declined 53 percent in its sophomore outing to $12.5 million. Still, House is no slouch, finishing Sunday with a domestic total of $44.8 million and $65.8 million worldwide. \n  \n In its third weekend, Paul Feig and Lionsgate's sleeper hit A Simple Favor, starring Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively, followed at No. 4 domestically with $6.6 million. The black comedy's North American tally stands at $43.1 million through Sunday, and $62.9 million globally. \n  \n New Line's horror pic The Nun remained a force to be reckoned in its fourth weekend, rounding out the top five with $5.4 million for a domestic cume of $109 million. The pic also topped a quiet weekend overseas with $16.2 million from 80 markets for a foreign sum of $221 million and $330 million worldwide, the best showing of any film in the Conjuring universe. \n  \n CBS Films and Gregory Plotkin's modestly budgeted slasher film Hell Fest, distributed by Lionsgate, opened in sixth place with $5.1 million from 2,297 theaters, on par with expectations. The pic stars Amy Forsyth, Bex Taylor-Klaus, Reign Edwards and Tony Todd and centers on a group of teens who are pursued by a killer at a horror-themed amusement park on Halloween. Audiences gave the film a C CinemaScore, not unusual for the genre. \n  \n The fourth new movie opening nationwide, albeit in far fewer locations, was Little Women, the seventh big-screen adaptation of the iconic novel about the March sisters. The indie pic, from distributor Pinnacle Peak and playing in 643 cinemas, tanked with roughly $747,000. Sarah Davenport, Allie Jennings, Lucas Grabeel, Ian Bohen and Lea Thompson star. \n  \n With awards season getting underway, a flurry of films opened at the specialty box office, including National Geographic's critically acclaimed documentary Free Solo, which scored the best screen average of the year to date, $75,201. If estimates hold, it will boast the best opening average ever for a documentary, topping 2006's An Inconvenient Truth ($70,333). \n  \n Free Solo, launching in four theaters and fueled by a 100 percent Rotten Tomatoes score, follows professional climber Alex Honnold's quest to free-climb Yosemite's El Capitan and is the latest title to participate in the doc boom at the box office. \n  \n \"In a year when audiences are recognizing the power of seeing docs on the big screen, it's so gratifying to see Free Solo embraced as the thrilling theatrical experience it is,\" says National Geographic Global Networks CEO Courtney Monroe. \n  \n One exception to the doc upswing is Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 11/9, which bowed nationwide last weekend to just $3 million. In its second weekend, Fahrenheit 11/9 tumbled 63 percent to $1.1 million from 1,719 theaters for a domestic total of $5.2 million. Moore's latest film is one of the few docs to ever open wide, a risky move that isn't paying off. \n  \n Opting to launch nationwide was even more problematic for Dan Fogleman's Life Itself, which plummeted more than 65 percent in its second outing to $770,085 for a 10-day domestic total of $3.8 million, and Assassination Nation, which declined more than 80 percent in its second weekend to $202,827 for a total of $1.7 million. The two films, along with Fahrenheit 11/9, all made stops on the recent fall festival circuit. \n  \n Elsewhere at the specialty box office, Fox Searchlight's The Old Man & the Gun, the last film Robert Redford says he will star in, posted a respectable screen average of $30,000 as it debuted in five locations. The crime drama, directed by David Lowery and co-starring Sissy Spacek and Casey Affleck, tells the gritty tale of compulsive real-life bank robber Forrest Tucker, who escaped from prison 16 times over the course of a long career that ended when he was in his late 70s. Danny Glover, Tika Sumpter, Isiah Whitlock Jr., John David Washington, Tom Waits and Elisabeth Moss co-star. \n  \n \"We opened in a group of theaters that are supported by different demos, so it is very encouraging to see audiences in both the Landmark in West L.A. as well as the Regal Union Square [in Manhattan] coming to see the film,\" says Searchlight's Frank Rodriguez. \n  \n Washington pulled double duty this weekend, between Old Man & the Gun and Neon's Monsters and Men, helmed by first-time feature director Reinaldo Marcus Green. The police shooting drama, launching in 18 locations, posted a screen average of $7,277. (MoviePass recently announced it has taken a financial stake in the film.) \n  \n Sept. 30, 7:40 a.m. Updated with weekend estimates. |||||\nWhat is a shorter version of the above article?"

        "value": "I sought out this film for one reason--Al Adamson. He is among the worst directors of all time--right up there with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of awfulness. However, I was a tad disappointed because although the film was indeed bad, it never approached the levels of awfulness of some of his earlier schlocky movies. Because of that, this film wasn't particularly fun to watch for us bad movie fans.\n\nNow I was wary about watching this film, as the title \"Naughty Stewardesses\" makes the film sound like a pornographic film--something I wouldn't be reviewing on IMDb. However, this film appeared to be this at times--particularly the first 10 minutes. But, you could tell that the script underwent many changes, as for much of the film there isn't any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly NOT sexy! The result of all this is total confusion.\n\nSadly, none of the many parts are even good. For example, as a porn video, it shows surprisingly little AND it's incomprehensible why they would put a 71 year-old guy in some of the love scenes. Sure, for a 71 year-old Mr. Livingston looked pretty good--but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet! Then, when the final 20 minutes becomes very violent, as Livingston became a Rambo-like guy! Talk about weird and inappropriate.\n\nOverall, there is little to recommend this sad movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title like \"Naughty Stewardesses\".\nChoose your answer. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?\nOPT:\n1). negative\n2). positive"

It explores the devastating environmental and health effects caused by the mining of lead and zinc in the Tar Creek region of northeastern Oklahoma. The area, once packed with mining operations, is now an EPA Superfund site due to hazardous waste and contaminated waters left behind by mining. The documentary investigates the impact it has had on the communities living there and raises awareness about their struggle.\n\nHot Girls Wanted is a 2015 documentary directed by filmmakers Jill Bauer and Ronna Gradus. The film takes an in-depth look at the amateur pornography industry and its exploitation of young women, specifically the \"girl-next-door\" type. It gives viewers a raw, behind-the-scenes glimpse at the lives of several 18- and 19-year-old girls who get lured into the business by the appeal of fame and easy money, only to face objectification, manipulation, and emotional consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, Tar Creek and Hot Girls Wanted are two different documentaries tackling distinct subjects. While Tar Creek focuses on the environmental and health issues of a mining community in Oklahoma, Hot Girls Wanted sheds light on the harsh realities of the amateur pornography industry and its impact on young women."

In the context provided, the genre of scientific literature experienced significant growth in importance, with natural history becoming increasingly popular among the upper classes during the Enlightenment period. This encompassed various areas of study, including botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology, and mineralogy, within which anatomy was a crucial component.\n\nOne such figure who studied anatomy is Jacques Gautier d'Agoty, a French anatomist, painter, and printmaker. He is best known for his work, La Myologie compl\u00e8te, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746), which focuses on providing detailed descriptions of all the muscles in the human body. Through this work, Gautier d'Agoty contributed to the study and understanding of human anatomy, and his methods involved the interdisciplinary exchange of scientific ideas.\n\nAnother influential contributor to the study of anatomy is Ren\u00e9-Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur, a French scientist who devoted his life to the study of natural history. Although his primary focus was on insects and metallurgy, he also touched upon anatomy in the context of natural history. R\u00e9aumur's Histoire naturelle des insectes provides valuable insights into the intricate anatomy of insects.\n\nIn addition to the mentioned individuals, other prominent figures who studied anatomy during the Enlightenment era and beyond include:\n\n- Andreas Vesalius: A Flemish anatomist and physician, Vesalius is considered the father of modern anatomy due to his seminal work, De humani corporis fabrica (On the Fabric of the Human Body), which provided in-depth examinations of human anatomy and revolutionized the study of medicine.\n  \n- William Harvey: An English physician, Harvey is well-known for his accurate description of blood circulation and the function of the heart. His work, Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus (On the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals), laid the foundation for understanding the cardiovascular system.\n\n- Albrecht von Haller: A Swiss anatomist, physiologist, and naturalist, Haller studied the anatomy of various animals to better understand the functioning of organs, the nervous system, and the circulatory system.\n\n- Marie Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Bichat: A French anatomist and pathologist, Bichat is known for his advancements in the field of tissue pathology. His work, Anatomie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la physiologie et \u00e0 la m\u00e9decine, sought to classify different types of tissue in the human body.\n\nDuring the Enlightenment, universities and academies taught natural history as a key part of education, preparing students for careers in diverse fields such as medicine and theology. The study of anatomy was an essential facet of this interdisciplinary approach that involved collaboration and the exchange of knowledge and ideas. As a result, the individuals mentioned above, as well as countless others, significantly contributed to the advancement of anatomical knowledge, laying the groundwork for the modern understanding of the human body and the broader field of natural history."

Besides her memorable songs, her collaboration with leading musicians and singers of her time made her one of the respected figures in the Hindi film music world.\n\nRajkumari Dubey worked extensively with music director Anil Biswas, who helped her develop her singing style. She also sang for many films with music by Khemchand Prakash, and she was one of the favorite singers of music director Naushad. Despite her contribution to Indian cinema, her work is often overshadowed by that of her contemporaries, such as Lata Mangeshkar, who dominated the music industry during that period. However, songs like \"Sun Bairi Baalam Sach Bol Re\", \"Ghabrekar Ke Jo Hum Sir Ko Takraayan\" and \"Najariya Ki Maari\" are examples of her immense talent and are remembered even today."

        "value": "- \"Hands Clean\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, for her fifth studio album, \"Under Rug Swept,\" which she released in 2002. It was written, composed, and produced by Morissette herself, and released as the album's lead single on 8 February 2002. It is a pop rock song, featuring a shuffling, largely acoustic-rock framework. Lyrically, \"Hands Clean\" caused controversy, since it is reportedly the singers recollection of a forbidden sexual relationship she shared with a much older man when she was approximately 14 years of age.  - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \"popular music\" and \"pop music\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \"Pop\" and \"rock\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \"alternative\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \"alternative\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Alanis Nadine Morissette (born June 1, 1974) is a Canadian-American alternative rock singer-songwriter, musician, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and actress. Morissette began her career in Canada in the early 1990s, with two commercially successful dance-pop albums. Afterwards, she moved to Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, and in 1995 released \"Jagged Little Pill\", a more rock-oriented album which sold more than 33 million units globally and is her most critically acclaimed work. Her following album, \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\", was released in 1998.  - \"Precious Illusions\" is a song written, recorded and produced by Alanis Morissette, for her fifth album \"Under Rug Swept\" (2002). It released as the album's second and final international single on 5 August 2002. Its lyrics describe a conflict between idealism and realism, and its protagonist refers to her childhood fancies as \"precious illusions\" that she has distanced herself from with a feeling that reminds her of \"parting with an imaginary friend\".  - Dance-pop is a pop and dance subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of electronic dance music and pop music, with influences of disco music, post-disco, new wave, synthpop, electropop and house, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions.  - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \"rock and roll\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Under Rug Swept is the fifth studio album and third internationally released album by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. Released by Maverick Records in the United States on February 26, 2002 and in the United Kingdom a day earlier (see 2002 in music), it was the first album Morissette had written and produced all on her own. It debuted at number one on charts in 12 countries, including the United States and Canada, and produced the singles \"Hands Clean\" and \"Precious Illusions\". Sales, however, did not match those of Morissette's previous two studio albums.  - Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is the fourth studio album and second internationally released album by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 3, 1998.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - `` Utopia '' is a pop rock song written by Alanis Morissette , and produced by her for her fifth album , Under Rug Swept ( 2002 ) .  - Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album and international debut album by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, first released on June 13, 1995, through Maverick Records. Morissette had released two successful albums in Canada, after which she left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch. Morissette began work on her next album after moving from her hometown, Ottawa, to Toronto; she did not make much progress until she traveled to Los Angeles, where she met Glen Ballard. Morissette and Ballard had an instant connection, and began co-writing and experimenting with sounds.

She raises her daughter with the help of Willy's friend, Peter. Fifteen years later, Willy, who now has an international career as a singer under his stage name, 'Bill Perry', returns to Wiesbaden as part of a European tour. He goes straight to see Therese, who does not mention that they have a daughter. However, Evie is a big fan of Bill Perry and she gets to know him anyway. Therese confides in Evie the truth about her father, and the girl later tells Willy that she is his daughter. However, Willy's visit does not bring about the expected happy ending.

        "value": "The skeleton of lampreys is made of cartilage. \n\nLampreys are a unique group of ancient jawless fish called Agnatha, existing for over 360 million years. As one of the oldest vertebrates, they possess several distinctive features that set them apart from their modern counterparts.\n\nThe lamprey's internal skeleton is composed of cartilaginous materials instead of bone. Cartilage is a flexible, semi-rigid connective tissue found in various structures in the body, such as the nose, ears, and joints. In lampreys, the cartilaginous skeleton provides structural integrity and support to the body while allowing it to retain its flexibility and movement.\n\nCartilage is a light and porous material composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes. These cells secrete the extracellular matrix, which mainly consists of collagen and water. Collagen is a fibrous protein that forms a strong and flexible meshwork, accounting for about 30% of the cartilage's dry weight. Since cartilage lacks the dense calcium deposits found in bone, the lamprey's skeleton remains comparatively lightweight.\n\nLigament, another option, is also composed primarily of collagen fibers; however, its function is primarily to connect bones together within the body, providing stability to joints. Both cartilage and ligaments contain collagen, but they differ in their roles concerning skeletal support and maintaining joint integrity. Lampreys do not have a fully ossified skeleton, making ligament a less appropriate choice for their primary skeletal component.\n\nChitin is another common structural component found in nature, but it is not present in lampreys. Chitin is a complex carbohydrate that forms the exoskeleton of arthropods like insects, crustaceans, and arachnids. Since it composes the external structures of these invertebrate animals, chitin is not used in the internal skeletal system of lampreys.\n\nIn summary, the lamprey's skeleton is primarily composed of cartilage. This unique feature helps them maintain a flexible and lightweight physique while navigating their aquatic environments. In comparison, ligaments, collagen, and chitin serve different functional roles in vertebrates and invertebrates, but none are the primary structural component of a lamprey's internal skeleton."

They are sharing or swapping tools and books, cars and handbags, time and talent. The renewed desire to share shows up in a variety of examples: A car-sharing service has had a 70 percent membership increase since the crisis occurred. Some companies encouraged his employees to take vanpooling. Governments are putting bikes on the street for public use. How-to-swap Web sites are increasing quickly. The economy reflects the way Americans have cut back, especially on daily items: Department store sales dropped 1.3 percent in June. People are not buying cars, and as a result, auto sales dropped 27.7 percent last month. They are not paying others to do what they can do themselves -- Home Depot reports increased attendance at in-store do-it-yourself clinics. And although paint sales are down in general, according to Sherwin-Williams, individual consumers are still buying. When Tom Burdett needed to cut some tiles at his home outside Annapolis, he refused to buy expensive tools. So he asked his neighbors and friends for help. Sure enough, someone had just what he needed. And when that friend needed help fixing a satellite dish, Burdett volunteered to help. The sharing mind-set is not new to the American culture, but many Americans give it up when the nation changed from an agricultural society to an industrial one, said Rosemary Hornak, a psychology professor at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C. They moved farther from their families and did not have time to connect with new neighbors because they worked so much, she said. Neighborhood conversations tell more of the story as the movement grows organically   in communities across the Washington region and the nation. On one street in Arlington, for example, neighbors are collecting their separate money for mulch   and dividing it among themselves. Question: What is the text mainly about?"

        "value": "Which entity is this text about?\n\nThe Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1964 by brothers Ray and Dave Davies. They are regarded as one of the most important and influential rock bands of the 1960s. The band emerged during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their touring ban in 1965. Their third single, the Ray Davies-penned \"You Really Got Me\", became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States.\n\nThe Kinks started out playing the then popular R&B and blues styles; then, under the influence of The Kingsmen's \"Louie Louie\" recording, developed louder rock and hard rock sounds -- due to their pioneering contribution to the field, they have often been labelled as \"the original punks\". Dave Davies was \"really bored with this guitar sound - or lack of an interesting sound\" so he purchased \"a little green amplifier ... an Elpico\" from a radio spares shop in Muswell Hill, and \"twiddled around with it\", including \"taking the wires going to the speaker and putting a jack plug on there and plugging it straight into my AC30\" (a larger amplifier), but didn't get the sound he wanted until he got frustrated and \"got a single-sided Gillette razorblade and cut round the cone [from the centre to the edge] ... so it was all shredded but still on there, still intact. I played and I thought it was amazing.\" The jagged sound of the amplifier was replicated in the studio; the Elpico was plugged into the Vox AC30, and the resulting effect became a mainstay in The Kinks' early recordings--most notably on \"You Really Got Me\" and \"All Day and All of the Night\".  From 1966 onwards, The Kinks came to be known for their adherence to traditions of English music and culture, during a period when many other British bands dismissed their heritage in favour of American blues, R&B and pop styles. Ray Davies recalled that at a distinct moment in 1965 he decided to break away from the American scene, and write more introspective and intelligent songs. \"I decided I was going to use words more, and say things. I wrote 'Well Respected Man'. That was the first real word-oriented song I wrote. ... [I also] abandoned any attempt to Americanise my accent.\" The Kinks' allegiance to English styles was strengthened by the ban placed on them by the American Federation of Musicians. The ban cut them off from the American record buying public, the world's largest musical market, forcing them to focus on Britain and mainland Europe. The Kinks expanded on their English sound throughout the remainder of the 1960s, incorporating elements of music hall, folk, and baroque music through use of harpsichord, acoustic guitar, mellotron, and horns, and creating some of the most influential and important music of the period.  Beginning with Everybody's In Show-biz (1972), Ray Davies began exploring theatrical concepts on the group's albums; these themes became manifest on the 1973 album Preservation Act 1 and continued through Schoolboys In Disgrace (1976). The Kinks found little success with these conceptual works, and reverted to a traditional rock format throughout the remainder of the 1970s. Sleepwalker (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would become their norm. The band returned to hard rock for Low Budget (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career."

No charges have been filed yet, but police said they picked up the men based on surveillance video retrieved from the Jamaica crime scene. They're still looking for a fourth man seen in the surveillance video. \n  \n The 50-year-old woman was walking to the subway Tuesday after attending Celestial Church of Christ on Liberty Avenue when two men put a gun to her head and forced her to the ground behind a garbage truck, police have said. \n  \n Exclusive Real Estate Heir Confesses Involvement in Slayings of 4 Men \n  \n At least two other men joined, and they made the victim perform a sexual act on them, according to police. \n  \n 40 Years Later: A Look Back at the NYC Blackout of 1977 \n  \n They stole her purse, which contained money, cards and a cellphone, police said. The suspects weren't happy with the amount of money the woman had and they ordered her to take her clothes off, according to police. \n  \n The desperate woman screamed out a falsehood, \"I'm HIV positive! You can't,\" which likely kept her from being raped, according to pastor Kehinde Oyetund. \n  \n Top News Photos: Accused Russian Spy Pleads Guilty \n  \n The suspects fled the scene and the victim ran back to the church, screaming out for the pastor. \n  \n \"I'm downstairs in the office and I heard her screaming,\" Oyetund said. \"She was crying and shivering.\" \n  \n The victim was then able to call authorities. \n  \n Oyetund said she's doing as well as she can be given the nature of the attack. \n  \n Top Tri-State News Photos \n  \n Many women who belong to the church are terrified to walk the streets alone.

While they do so, the missionaries ask their next-door neighbor, Holly, to check on the homeless preacher in their home. Upon their return, they have dinner with Holly and Louis and continue to do so for a few days.  In this time, the missionaries learn that Louis once was a preacher who lost his congregation due to alcoholism and that Holly\u2014a struggling actress\u2014acted in a few adult movies, her parents back home discovering and cutting off contact with her as a result. Elder Farrell promises that God will never stop loving her regardless of her mistakes. At a local ward luau, another missionary interviews Carl for baptism, teaching him the story of Ammon, a missionary who teaches a group of people  to give up their weapons and bury them deep in the ground, vowing never to use them again. The night before his baptism, Carl buries his weapons in the yard and Elder Lozano baptizes him the following day. contains an answer for the question: What are the full names of the people that Carl tracks down for saving his life?, what is it ?"

It's implied within the article that these are their full names as it is customary for Mormon missionaries to be addressed as \"Elder\" followed by their last name. Elder Farrell is portrayed as a strict adherer to the rules while Elder Lozano, played by Ignacio Serricchio, is depicted as being on the verge of completing his missionary service. In the presented scenario, these two missionaries intervene in a gang drive-by shooting incident, resulting in Elder Lozano saving Carl, a wounded gang member. Reduced to a vulnerable state and indebted to the missionaries for saving his life, Carl seeks out Elder Farrell and Elder Lozano to express his gratitude after being discharged from the hospital. Notably, his appreciation is further deepened when Elder Lozano presents him with a Book of Mormon. This chain of events, initiated by Carl tracking down Elder Farrell and Elder Lozano, sets the stage for his subsequent exploration of the Mormon faith and his ultimate baptism."

        "value": "Odissi (Odia: odd'ishii Odisi), also referred to as Orissi in older literature, is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples of Odisha - an eastern coastal state of India. Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women, and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism (Vishnu as Jagannath). Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses (Shaktism). The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of Odissi Hindu temples, and archeological sites related to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.\n\nAfter 12th-century, Odia temples, monasteries and nearby institutions such as the Nalanda in eastern Indian subcontinent came under waves of attacks and ransacking by Muslim armies, a turmoil that impacted all arts and eroded the freedoms previously enjoyed by performance artists. The official records of Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq's invasion in Odisha (1360-1361 CE), for example, describe the destruction of the Jagannath temple as well as numerous other temples, defacing of dancing statues, and ruining of dance halls. This led to a broad decline in Odissi and other religious arts, but there were some benevolent rulers in this period who supported arts particularly through performances at courts. During the Sultanate and Mughal era of India, the temple dancers were moved to entertain the Sultan's family and courts. They became associated with concubinage to the nobility.  The Odissi dance likely expanded in the 17th century, states Alexandra Carter, under King Ramachandradeva's patronage. This expansion integrated martial arts (akhanda) and athletics into Odissi dance, by engaging boys and youth called Gotipuas, as a means to physically train the young for the military and to resist foreign invasions. According to Ragini Devi, historical evidence suggests that the Gotipuas tradition was known and nurtured in the 14th century, by Raja of Khurda.  During the British Raj, the officials of the colonial government ridiculed the temple traditions, while Christian missionaries launched a sustained attack on the moral outrage of sensuousness of Odissi and other Hindu temple dance arts. In 1872, a British civil servant named William Hunter watched a performance at the Jagannath temple in Puri, then wrote, \"Indecent ceremonies disgraced the ritual, and dancing girls with rolling eyes put the modest worshipper to the blush...\", and then attacked them as idol-worshipping prostitutes who expressed their devotion with \"airy gyrations\".  Christian missionaries launched the \"anti-dance movement\" in 1892, to ban all such dance forms. The dancers were dehumanized and stigmatized as prostitutes during the British period. In 1910, the British colonial government in India banned temple dancing, and the dance artists were reduced to abject poverty from the lack of any financial support for performance arts, combined with stereotyping stigma.\n\nAsk a question about this article."

        "value": "Write a title for this article:\n\nMembers of the 113th Congress, many with family members, take the oath of office in the House of Representatives chamber. Photograph: J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe finance chairman of the Republican national committee, Ray Washburne, travelled to Chicago last Wednesday to solicit money from two big funders who had reached their donation limit for this election cycle. While he was on the plane, the supreme court ruled that there would no longer be any limits. Washburne told the New York Times that when he landed and heard the news, he said: \"Eureka\". He came back with promises of more cash.\n\nIt's the American Way. Just as the constitution ostensibly requires that AK47s be available on demand, it was also apparently designed to open the sluicegates to money in politics, until the entire landscape is flooded with cash and cynicism and the border between what is unethical and what is legal is washed away. It's what the funding fathers intended.\n\nThere are lots of areas of American society that could do with more money: preschools, infrastructure, mental health clinics, homeless shelters. The one place it's not needed is in politics. Even in this most polarised of moments, this is one of the few things on which most Americans agree. Indeed, support for limits on campaign donations is high among all income and education levels, party allegiances and political philosophies, and has remained consistent over the last five years. During that time, the supreme court has systematically removed many of the restrictions that did exist. In 2008 spending on the presidential election almost doubled compared with 2004. In 2012 it almost quadrupled compared with 2008. \"Every presidential election is the most expensive ever. Elections don't get cheaper,\" the federal election chairwoman, Ellen Weintraub, told Politico.\n\nLast week's ruling was not as transformative as the case of Citizens United in 2010. Then, the supreme court determined that, since corporations had the same rights as people, they had the right to unfettered free speech under the first amendment and so should be able to spend as much money as they wanted on political campaigns. Last Wednesday's decision, building on Citizens United, argued that since money has been equated with speech, rich individuals should not be muzzled in their ability to speak cash to power.\n\nPreviously, there was a limit of $123,200 that any individual could donate to candidates or parties in a two-year election cycle. There was also a limit on how much a person could give to each particular candidate. The cap on donations to a single candidate still stands. But now you can give to as many candidates as you like and up to $3.6m in an election cycle. They could buy up the whole of Congress if they wanted to.\n\nRelatively few people have both the desire and the ability to do that. Fewer than 600 donors gave the maximum in 2012. But raw numbers are deceptive. The rich, already powerful, punch way above their weight. In 2010 just 0.01% of Americans accounted for a quarter of all the money given to politicians, parties and political action committees. If anything this makes the loosening of donation rules more damning, not less. For at a time of escalating economic inequality and declining social mobility, the pool of politicians' paymasters will shrink even further.\n\nIn a system where money is considered speech, and corporations are people, this trend is inevitable. Elections become not a system of participatory engagement determining how the country is run, but the best democratic charade that money can buy. People get a vote; but only once money has decided whom they can vote for and what the agenda should be. The result is a plutocracy that operates according to the golden rule: that those who have the gold make the rules.\n\nIn his book Affluence and Influence: Economic Inequality and Political Power in America, Princeton professor Martin Gilens illustrates how the political class does the bidding of the rich. \"Across multiple presidential administrations and a wide range of political conditions, two patterns remain constant,\" he writes. \"First, the poor never have as much influence as the middle class, and the middle class never has as much influence as the affluent. Second, over the last four decades, responsiveness to the affluent has steadily increased, while responsiveness to the middle class and the poor has depended entirely on the existence of [specific] circumstances.\"\n\nThis should come as no surprise. Rich people don't come by their wealth by giving it away for nothing. And these are not charitable donations. When they give cash to politicians they expect something in return. And they get it. Money buys access and access permits influence.\n\nAt times this is blatant. Roughly 30% of diplomatic posts in Barack Obama's administration have gone to friends and donors. A study by Pennsylvania State University professors last year established an approximate price for ambassadorships. Ambassador to Portugal would set you back $341,160 in bundled contributions; Luxembourg $1.8m; while Britain could cost you anything up to $2.3m. In a recent segment called Diplomat Buyers Club, comedian Jon Stewart showed Obama's picks for the ambassadors of Argentina, Iceland and Norway (all donors), testifying that they have never been to the countries they sought jobs for.\n\nBut it's also about who doesn't get to speak. Candidates are likely to hear less on the campaign trail about how the war on drugs is blighting black and Latino neighbourhoods, or how poverty is reducing the life expectancy of poor white women, because those people don't get a seat at the table.\n\nEither way, when chief supreme court justice John Roberts quotes the Citizen's United ruling, claiming \"ingratiation and access \u2026 are not corruption\", he is clearly working from a narrow and disingenuous definition of corruption.\n\nLast year, three members of the House of Representatives pleaded guilty to, or were convicted of, crimes \u2013 the highest number since 1981 \u2013 while the former mayors of Detroit and New Orleans, among others, were convicted of, or charged with, felonies. Earlier this year the former Virginia governor, Bob McDonnell, was indicted for accepting loans and gifts in return for favours. Just two weeks ago the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, resigned over a bribery scandal. Neither has been convicted of any offence. Corruption is already a major problem in American politics. The highest court in the land has just made it both more likely, and more legal."

        "value": "Given the background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn\u2019t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease.  and the situation: Margaret is a sophomore in high school who just started her Spring break. With a week off from school, her family is spending some time driving out of state to visit her grandma, Kathy, who has a cabin up in the snowy mountains. Margaret always enjoys spending time with her grandma because she has interesting stories and makes some of the best pie around. Also, they always go skiing when visiting the cabin so Margaret is excited for that.  Answer the following question: Who would be more likely to get lost on the mountain?"

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Given the background information and situation, it is more likely that Kathy, Margaret's grandmother, would be at a higher risk of getting lost on the mountain as compared to Margaret. There are several reasons that contribute to this conclusion, which I will outline below.\n\n1. Age-related health issues: As mentioned in the background information, during late adulthood individuals face an increased risk of developing health issues such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. These conditions may cause general weakness and even affect Kathy's stamina and endurance, making it more difficult for her to navigate the mountain terrain. A decline in physical health can also impact Kathy's cognitive abilities, which could further increase the chances of her getting lost.\n\n2. Sensory and reflex decline: As people age, their sensory and reflex capabilities tend to decline. This means that Kathy's ability to see, hear, and react to changes in her environment may be diminished compared to Margaret's. Difficulty in interpreting sensory cues might make it harder for Kathy to recognize landmarks or follow a specific path while skiing, increasing the likelihood of her losing her way.\n\n3. Weak immune system: A weakened immune system in older adults also makes them more susceptible to illnesses, which may impact their overall energy levels and physical capabilities. If Kathy were to fall ill while on the trip, her ability to navigate the mountain and keep track of her surroundings could be significantly impeded, putting her at greater risk of getting lost.\n\n4. Increased prevalence of arthritis: The majority of older adults develop arthritis, which can cause pain, stiffness, and limited mobility. If Kathy has arthritis, it may affect her ability to ski, walk, or move comfortably through the snowy mountain environment. This discomfort and limited mobility may further contribute to her getting disoriented or lost on the mountain.\n\n5. The risk of Alzheimer's disease: One in four older adults is at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, which can cause memory loss, confusion, and disorientation. If Kathy is one of those affected by Alzheimer's or has any other form of dementia, she may struggle with remembering routes, recognizing landmarks, or maintaining a clear sense of direction while on the mountain, substantially raising her chances of getting lost.\n\nIn contrast, Margaret is a young, energetic, and presumably healthy high school sophomore. Her age and physical abilities give her an advantage in navigating the mountain and reducing the likelihood of getting lost. However, it is essential to consider that regardless of age, anyone can get lost in unfamiliar terrain, so it's crucial for both Margaret and Kathy to take necessary precautions, such as using maps, skiing with a buddy, and staying on designated trails."

A young woman in labour makes her way to a parish workhouse and dies after giving birth to a boy, who is systematically named Oliver Twist by the workhouse authorities. As the years go by, Oliver and the rest of the child inmates suffer from the callous indifference of the officials in charge: beadle Mr. Bumble and matron Mrs. Corney. At the age of nine, the hungry children draw straws; Oliver loses and has to ask for a second helping of gruel (\"Please sir, I want some more\"). For his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry, from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker, Noah, maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping. Oliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger, a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin, an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow, a rich, elderly gentleman. Their attempt is detected, but it is Oliver who is chased through the streets by a mob and arrested. A witness clears him. Mr. Brownlow takes a liking to the boy, and gives him a home. Oliver experiences the kind of happy life he has never had before, under the care of Mr. Brownlow and the loving housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin. Meanwhile, Fagin is visited by the mysterious Monks, who has a strong interest in Oliver. He sends Monks to Bumble and Mrs. Corney (now Bumble's domineering wife); Monks buys from them the only thing that can identify Oliver's parentage, a locket containing his mother's portrait."
