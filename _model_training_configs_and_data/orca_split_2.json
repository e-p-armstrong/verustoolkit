Unfortunately, these pregnancies are not viable and can be life-threatening if untreated. Navigating an ectopic pregnancy can be emotionally challenging and physically draining. This article will provide guidance for individuals coping with this rare but serious condition, highlighting the importance of support from loved ones, asking questions, and understanding medical treatments such as methotrexate injections and surgical procedures.\n\nAcknowledging a Non-Viable Pregnancy\n\nComing to terms with the fact that an ectopic pregnancy is not viable can be incredibly challenging and emotional. It's essential to remember that women experiencing this have done nothing wrong; such pregnancies usually occur due to factors beyond their control. Recognizing the reality of the situation is crucial for making the best decisions moving forward. Feeling grief, anger, or fear is natural, and seeking support from a therapist or support group may help ease these emotions.\n\nAsking Questions and Seeking Support from Loved Ones\n\nDuring this challenging time, it's essential to talk to your doctor and ask questions. Understanding the causes and implications of an ectopic pregnancy will help you feel more in control and allow you to make more informed decisions about your treatment. Topics to discuss could include risk factors, potential impacts on future fertility, and ways to additional emotional support, such as counseling or support groups.\n\nHaving a friend or loved one by your side during this time can provide invaluable emotional support and another person to help listen and ask questions during medical appointments. Do not hesitate to reach out to your support network and lean on them during this time.\n\nMethotrexate Injection for Ectopic Pregnancy\n\nOnce an ectopic pregnancy has been diagnosed, treatment must be initiated to protect your health. Methotrexate is a medication that can be used to dissolve the pregnancy when caught early. It's a chemotherapy drug that works by stopping cell growth, effectively halting the development of the ectopic pregnancy. \n\nThe injection is given at a hospital or clinic, and patients must be monitored closely with blood tests to ensure the medication is working effectively. Methotrexate injections are a non-surgical option and may be recommended based on factors such as the size and location of the pregnancy, the patient's overall health, and the absence of symptoms like extreme pain or bleeding.\n\nConsenting to Surgical Treatment\n\nIn some cases, methotrexate may not be a suitable option or may not adequately dissolve the ectopic pregnancy. In these instances, surgical intervention becomes necessary. The most commonly performed surgery for an ectopic pregnancy is a laparoscopic procedure, which involves making small incisions in the abdomen and using a camera to guide the surgeon to the affected area.\n\nDuring this surgery, the ectopic pregnancy is removed, and the fallopian tube may be repaired or, in some cases, removed. This procedure has a shorter recovery time compared to open surgery and can usually be performed as an outpatient procedure.\n\nConclusion\n\nCoping with an ectopic pregnancy requires emotional and physical resilience. Acknowledging the non-viability of the pregnancy is crucial for decision-making. Seeking medical advice, understanding available treatment options, and having a stable support system can aid in navigating this difficult time. Methotrexate injections and surgical treatments are standard interventions, and your doctor will help determine the best course of action for your individual needs. Remember, you are not alone in this journey, and resources and support are available to help guide you through this challenging experience."

This move has implications on both Taiwan's domestic market and its international trade relations with the United States. This article delves into the reasons behind this decision and its potential impact on both countries.\n\nStep 1: Understand the background of the decision\nTo fully comprehend the ongoing situation, it is essential to be aware of the past trade disputes and health concerns surrounding imported US beef. In the late 2000s, Taiwan had imposed a complete ban on US beef products due to concerns over health risks, particularly mad cow disease. However, following negotiations, the ban was lifted with some restrictions still in place.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the reasons for reinstating the partial ban\nTaiwan's decision to restore the partial ban on US beef imports is being driven by multiple factors:\n- Health concerns: Despite the initial lifting of the ban, fears over health risks persist, particularly concerning growth hormones and feed additives that are common in American cattle-farming practices.\n- Consumer preferences: Taiwanese consumers' preference for locally-sourced and organic produce has been growing stronger, which puts pressure on the government to promote domestic agriculture.\n- Trade negotiations: The partial ban may be seen as a negotiating tactic to gain leverage in future trade talks with the US.\n\nStep 3: Assess the impact on Taiwan's economy and domestic market\nThe reinstated partial ban is expected to have repercussions on Taiwan's domestic markets:\n- Reduced supply of imported beef: The partial ban will inevitably lead to a decrease in the availability of imported US beef in the Taiwanese market.\n- Higher prices: The reduced supply may potentially result in a price increase of beef products, affecting local consumers.\n- Support for local agriculture: However, the ban may also provide an opportunity for Taiwan's domestic beef industry to expand and capture a larger market share.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the implications for US-Taiwan trade relations\nThe restoration of the partial ban is expected to have implications on the trade relations between the US and Taiwan:\n- Trade disputes: The ban may spark a new round of trade disputes between the two countries, hindering the progress of any ongoing trade negotiations.\n- US farmers' concerns: US beef producers, who have already been negatively impacted by trade disputes with China, are likely to express concerns about losing another market.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, Taiwan's restoration of the partial ban on US beef imports is a complex issue driven by multiple factors, ranging from health concerns to trade negotiations. The outcome of this decision is likely to affect the economies of both nations and may strain their existing trade ties. However, this also presents an opportunity for Taiwan's domestic beef industry to expand and satisfy local consumers' preferences for locally-produced meats."

        "value": "Write some highlights for the following article:\n\nMisogyny is so deeply rooted in India's collective psychology that even the president's son -- in this case, Congress Parliament member Abhijit Mukherjee -- could entangle himself with a remark against women protesting gang rape. He called them \"dented and painted women\" who go to discos, have little connection with ground realities and are making candlelight vigils fashionable. After an enormous backlash, he apologized and retracted his comments, but many are not satisfied and want his resignation. Misogyny has long permeated our textbooks, our pedagogy and our parenting. In fact, it runs so deep that it reflects itself even in our linguistics. The Hindi phrase most commonly used to describe sexual violence or rape against women is \"izzat lootna,\" which means \"to steal the honor of.\" Another Hindi word used for rape, \"balatkar\" (or \"bad act\"), is considered so erudite and technical that it's barely ever used. (Its English equivalent would be \"coitus\" instead of \"sex.\") So, for the most part, we're stuck with \"izzat lootna\" -- and the necessary question: Why should a rapist be given so much credit? Rape is a criminal act of force and perverse subjugation. When a woman is raped, her most fundamental rights as a human being are violated. Yet, she is just as honorable as she ever was. Honor cannot be stolen. It can only be surrendered. Surely in the act of rape, it is the perpetrator, not the victim, who surrenders honor. The brave girl from Delhi died with her honor intact. Her rapists will live in ignominy. Unfortunately, in India rape is inextricably linked by men -- and women -- to shame: the ultimate desecration. Many victims are murdered by their rapists or choose to commit suicide. It is also not uncommon for the parents of rape victims to kill themselves. Thus, most victims don't speak up about what happened to them, lest their families be ostracized, lest they never find a husband or be shunned by their friends. About 10 months ago, I was offered a role of a young, urban woman who gets gang raped. The film explores how she chooses to deal with what happens to her. It is a very powerful script, and most of me wanted to accept the role immediately. But a gnawing part of me worried about how I'd be perceived by the general public were I to perform this role. Female sexuality in Hindi cinema is extremely fraught, especially because audiences seem unable to comprehend the distinction between what a role demands from an actor and that person's conduct offscreen. In the script the woman is attractive, confident and self aware; she'd had several consensual relationships with men and enjoyed her sexuality. Truth be told, her character is not far from me in real life. Still, in patriarchal, judgmental, misogynistic Indian society, these are labels most women are afraid to carry publicly. On top of this, the character gets raped. I was afraid to accept the role. Afraid of whether audiences and the media would think I was promiscuous, desecrated. Embarrassed at the prospect of saying I'm doing a film in which I get raped, lest aspersions be cast on my character. There lay, in my own mind, the seeds of the same misogyny that makes Mr. Mukherjee's remarks in the wake of the student's gang rape so deplorable. Seeds I had to uproot at once. I accepted the role. At the time I was offered the film, rape wasn't getting the sort of national attention it is getting right now. It was still a topic that made most people uncomfortable, a topic that women and men alike were not able to freely express their opinions on. That India's young public is today demanding so vocally the need to address the way we view sexuality and gender equality is empowering. People are sharing their own experiences of sexual violence on blogs and social media. Men and women are collaborating to seek legal reform, to challenge the societal perceptions they have been force-fed. We now understand that to remain silent bystanders of a crime is to collude with the criminal. It is clear to me that as actors, filmmakers, artists, journalists, activists -- people who use a medium that has the potential to reach so many minds -- it is our responsibility to educate and mobilize, while we entertain. For the last 10 months, as we have been rehearsing and shooting, the subject of rape has been my foremost preoccupation. Two points have struck me in particular: First, the director, who is also the scriptwriter, is male. His co-writer, the music composer, is also male. These two artists, Tarun Chopra and Daboo Malik, chose to champion a cause that almost always gets packaged as a women's issue. In India, sexual violence is perpetrated almost entirely by men. Rapists are male. Should men not feel responsible then to prevent the occurrence of this crime? Shouldn't men be disturbed that their mothers, sisters, wives and daughters constantly feel unsafe or feel they have to dress and behave in a particular way to avoid getting raped? Isn't it time men educated other men about consent? Secondly, and this point took me longer to acknowledge, women are as guilty as men for the mindset that breeds the crime. We kill our own infant daughters, we immolate our sons' wives if they bear female children, we disapprove of women who make an effort to be attractive -- and doubt their character. We still look at marriage as if it's the purpose for which we were born. But misogyny is no longer misogyny when expressed by a woman. It's self-loathing. And while it is easy -- and justified -- for women to point fingers at men for the chauvinism in our society, don't we owe it to ourselves to look within? Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion."

Determined to get his life back on track, Miles plans to serve his time and make things right with his wife and daughter. While asleep on his bunk during his first night locked up, Miles is ripped awake by a terrifying crash. A moment later, in the dark, guards rush past his cell. Working with Anthony (Paul Rae), the \"lifer\" in the cell next to him, Miles tries to determine what is going on, but this is unlike anything that has ever happened in this prison. Soon, Miles and Anthony hear gunfire. And then screaming... the horrible, sickening screams of a man being torn apart. Something bad is happening in this prison. Outside of his cell, through the darkness, Miles can hear other inmates talking, yelling\u00e2\u0080\u0094trying to figure out what is happening. A voice over a PA system instructs all of the prisoners to remain calm and quiet. \"There has been a situation. It has been contained.\" But Miles and Anthony know that is a lie. Something is loose in the prison, and it is killing the guards. After some time, Miles understands that there are no prison guards left and that the thing outside his cell is connected to him."

The moment we walked in, we were greeted by a warm and inviting ambiance, with tastefully chosen decor and utmost attention to cleanliness. \n\nOur server, Jane, was an absolute delight. Her recommendations were on point, and she diligently checked on us throughout our meal, making sure we had everything we needed. The entire staff was attentive, friendly, and professional. \n\nThe food at Sunny Side Bistro was exceptional. We started with the house specialty, Crab Cakes with Aioli, which were perfectly cooked and full of flavor. For our main course, we shared a Wood-Fired Margherita Pizza and Grilled Salmon with Asparagus - both dishes were delicious and cooked to perfection. To top it off, their signature cocktail, the Bistro Berry Burst, was refreshing and complemented our meal beautifully.\n\nWhat made our experience even more memorable was the live jazz music playing in the background, creating the perfect atmosphere for us to enjoy our dinner and catch up with each other. \n\nI highly recommend Sunny Side Bistro for anyone looking for delicious food, attentive service, and a cozy atmosphere. This place truly exceeded our expectations and left us with a dining experience we won't soon forget."

One day, an old man came to a village. He told people there that Nian was afraid of three things----the color red, fire and noise. He told people to play drums and gongs, make big fires and set off fireworks to make Nian go away. On a moonless, cold night, Nian went to the village again. As soon as it opened its big mouth, people made loud noises and made fires. Nian was really afraid and ran away. wherever it went, there was noise and fire. When Nian was tired and could not run anymore, people killed the monster. After that, on the coldest day of winter, people beat drums and gongs, and set off fireworks to celebrate the death of the monster of Nian. They put up red lanterns and have a big dinner without sleeping during the night. In the morning people greet each other happily. So now we have the Spring Festival.\n\n1.

It was at some time after Eirkr left for England, and on the death of Svein while retreating to Sweden, maybe intent on returning to Norway with reinforcements, that Erikr's son Hakon went to join his father and support Cnut in England, too. Cnut's brother Harald may have been at Cnut's coronation, in 1016, returning to Denmark as its king, with part of the fleet, at some point thereafter. It is only certain, though, that there was an entry of his name, alongside Cnut's, in confraternity with Christ Church, Canterbury, in 1018. This is not conclusive, though, for the entry may have been made in Harald's absence, perhaps by the hand of Cnut himself, which means that, while it is usually thought that Harald died in 1018, it is unsure whether he was still alive at this point. Entry of his brother's name in the Canterbury codex may have been Cnut's attempt to make his vengeance for Harald's murder good with the Church. This may have been just a gesture for a soul to be under the protection of God. There is evidence Cnut was in battle with pirates in 1018, with his destruction of the crews of thirty ships, although it is unknown if this was off the English or Danish shores. He himself mentions troubles in his 1019 letter , written as the King of England and Denmark. These events can be seen, with plausibility, to be in connection with the death of Harald.

It is a feeling that comes from your heart, and it has to be cultivated and practiced. It is usually practiced in five stages. If you are a beginner, try to stay in each stage for five minutes.  Stage 1- Feel metta for yourself.  Focus on feelings of peace, tranquility, strength, and confidence.  You can repeat the phrase \"May I be well and happy.\" to yourself. Stage 2- Think of a friend and all of the things that you like about them. Repeat the phrase, \"May they be well; may they be happy.\" Stage 3- Think of someone that you are neutral about.  You do not like them or dislike them.  Consider the person's humanity and extend your feelings of metta to that person. Stage 4- Think of someone that you do not like at all.  Instead of thinking about why you do not like them and having hateful thoughts, send your feelings of metta to them. Stage 5- In this last stage, think of every single person including yourself.  Send metta to those people, your city, your neighborhood, your country, and the entire world. This type of mediation will teach you to concentrate and focus your thoughts.  Through this mediation you can learn to practice mindfulness, relax, and rid yourself of anxiety.  Find a sitting position that is comfortable for you. Your spine needs to be upright and relaxed. Your shoulders should be relaxed and slightly rolled back and down. Support your hands on a cushion or in your lap. Once you have your posture, begin going through the different stages. Each stage should last for at least 5 minutes.  Stage 1- Count internally (breathe in, breathe out, 1 breathe in, breathe out 2, etc.) after each breath until you reach 10. Start over once you have reached 10.  Focus on the sensations of breathing in and out.  Your mind will wander.  Just bring your thoughts back to your breathing. Stage 2-  Continue to breathe in cycles of 10, but count before you inhale this time (e.g.,1, breathe in, breathe out, 2, breathe in, breathe out, 3, etc.). Focus on the sensations you have when you are inhaling. Stage 3- Breathe in and out without counting. Try to see your breathing as a continuous process instead of just breathing in and breathing out. Stage 4- Your focus should now be in the sensations of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. This may be your breath passing over your nostrils or your upper lip. The ultimate goal of Buddhism is to achieve inner peace and then share your experience with other people. Attaining nirvana is not only for your benefit, but for the world as well. It is important for you to be a source of encouragement and support for others.  This is as simple as giving someone a hug if he or she is feeling down. If someone is important to you or does something nice for you, let the person know how you feel. Let people know that you are grateful for them and appreciate them.  If someone is having a bad day, provide a listening ear. Your happiness is directly related to the happiness of other people. Showing compassion promotes happiness for all. You can practice compassion in many ways:  Turn off your cell phone when you are spending time with friends and family. Make eye contact when someone is talking to you and listen without interrupting. Volunteer in your community. Open doors for other people. Be empathetic towards people.  For example, if someone is upset, acknowledge and try to understand why they are upset.  Ask them what you can do to help. Listen and show concern for their feelings. When you practice mindfulness, you pay attention to how you think and feel in the present moment.  Mindfulness is not only for meditation but for your every day life as well.  For example, you can be mindful as you eat, shower, or get dressed in the morning. Start by choosing one activity and then focus on the sensations in your body and your breathing as you do it.  If you want to mindful while you are eating, concentrate on the taste, texture, and smell of the food as you eat it. As you wash the dishes, pay attention to the temperature of the water, how your hands feel as you clean the dishes, and how the water feels as you rinse the dishes. Instead of listening to the music or the television as you get dressed in the morning, get ready in silence.  Notice how you feel.  Were you tired or well rested when you woke up? How does your body feel as you put on clothes or shower?"

It was released on VHS in Britain in the early 90's but went out of print. A U.S. company released it on DVD later, but that version also sold out. According to the website of the author of the book, the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it won't be released again, and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebay.\n\nI first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out. I found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks. It's certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east, even though the DVD says, \"made in Canada,\" ha ha. But it's a good copy, and you can't really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare, out of print, and lost in legal disputes.\n\nI love the movie. It's a period piece set in the 1920's, with all the very authentic and quaint British settings of that time. The Woman In Black is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the movie is very low-key, but effective and scary. There is no self indulgent gore, violence or much at all in special effects, but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments. It's a chilling classic styled ghost movie. The movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930's except for the color. Without all the flash of all the modern horror movies, I'm afraid this film will always just be a lost gem. For me, it places itself as one of my all time favorites.\nChoose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?\nPick from:\n(a). negative\n(b). positive"

Its success is surprising because the series is about the relaxing lifestyles of people who live in the country. There is none of the action that we usually see on TV today. There are also no stressful moments, busy offices or crowded cities. Away from it all is set in the peaceful English countryside and tells simple stories about people's kindness. The director of the TV series says that its success is a sign of teenagers suffering from stress. They say that watching Away from it all helps teenagers forget about the pressures of exams and homework, and the troubles that fill the world today. They also say that it's a good sign of today's young people turning to happier TV series as it shows they want a happier and healthier world. Although the series' success might have a good side, many teachers and parents are worried, however. They say that some of their students and children spend more time before TV and are using Away from it all as an excuse for not finishing homework. Some children have even refused to learn for exams because they say that they can only get personal happiness by avoiding stressful situations. And what do the experts say? Paula Ray, a doctor of education, says that TV can influence children's lifestyles. But she says that if a child reacts strongly, it' s likely that there are other reasons for his change in behaviour. She says that there is nothing wrong with watching Away from it all but suggests that parents should let their children know TV is not the same as real life.

This is called being \"culturally aware.\" It's like how we learn about people from other countries and try to understand them better.\n\nThe academics believed these robots should also learn how to make the elderly feel better, just as a good doctor would do. These clever robots would know how to talk to older people kindly, listen to their stories, and make sure they feel comfortable while helping them. We call this having a \"good bedside manner.\"\n\nThe smart academics figured that if they could create these humanoid robots, many elderly people who need care would be happier. Having someone who looked like a human, understood their thoughts and feelings, and treated them kindly would bring a big smile to their faces. And as a result, these robots could solve the big problem of finding the best care for the elderly.\n\nIn the end, the special humanoid robots would help older people with their everyday needs, understand their culture, and be very polite. This magical mix would create a world where our grandmas and grandpas would have plenty of love and happiness in their golden years. And that is a world we all want to live in.\n\nSo let's cheer for the smart academics and the kind humanoid robots who are trying to make life better for our dear elderly friends!"

The US Navy submarine S-33 has been modified to resemble a German U-boat to steal the Enigma coding device and sink the U-571.During a storm, the S-33 comes across U-571 and sends a boarding party over. After securing the ship and transporting the captured crew back to the American S-33 sub, the S-33 gets sunk by the arrival of a German resupply sub. The captain of the S-33, Lieutenant Commander Dahlgren, dying in the water, orders his men on the captured U-boat to submerge. Lieutenant Tyler takes command of the enemy U-boat and dives to engage the resupply sub in an underwater battle before destroying it.After making repairs and restoring power Tyler decides to route the disabled submarine to Land's End in Cornwall, England. They are spotted by a German plane which is unaware that the U-571 has been commandeered by Americans; a nearby German destroyer sends over a small contingent but right before boarders arrive, Tyler gives orders to fire a shot from the deck gun, destroying the German ship's radio room, and preventing it from reporting that the capture of a German sub and its Enigma machine and code books. The sub dives underneath the German ship, which then begins to drop depth charges to sink U-571.Tyler attempts to trick the destroyer into stopping its attack by ejecting debris and a corpse out of a torpedo tube, faking their own destruction. The German destroyer continues dropping depth charges. U-571, hiding at below 600 feet (180 m), is damaged by the high water pressure.

In fact , such is the fear associated with this date that people just can't seem to stick to their daily routine on this day . The data from Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute suggests that somewhere around 17 to 21 million Americans are affected by the fear associated with this day , i.e. the combination of Friday and 13 . Even worse , the financial losses caused on this day amounts to as much as US$800 million every year . As we flipped through the pages of history , we realized that Friday the 13th bears the brunt of bad luck associated with number 13 , the unluckiest number , and Friday , the unluckiest day of the week . Number 13 has always been considered unlucky , mainly as a result of it being associated with various occurrences in mythology . While some associate it with the instance of Norse mythology , in which the god of joy and gladness - Balter , was killed in a dishonest manner by Loki - the god of discord and mischief , who was the 13th guest , others associate it with the Last Supper , in which the 13th guest was Judas , who betrayed Jesus to his enemies for 30 pieces of silver . Similarly , Friday has also been a sign of bad luck to many people , with incidents like Jesus being crucified on this unfaithful day , contributing to this belief . It is also widely believed that Cain killed Able on this very day of the week . The fear of Friday the 13th is known as friggatriskaidekaphobia and paraskevidekatriaphobia , the former combining the words frigga , meaning Friday , and triskaidekaphobia , meaning the phobia of number 13 . Over the period , the belief that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day has just become one of the most widely accepted superstitions , which consequently causes much blind panic and unreasonable fear in the world ."

The once hearty trend of parents naming their babies after Biblical scripture has shown a steady decline in recent years according to an annual baby name report by BabyCenter.com. What can be gathered in supplement shows a perhaps surprising uptick in inspiration from pop culture such as erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, TV show Downton Abbey and even Apple electronics. Inspired: Beyonce's newborn baby Blue Ivy, pictured with her here, may be behind the slight jump in the same names for babies born this year along with other pop culture references. Among names taken from the Bible for 2012 there were just three boys' names among the list of top 10 - Ethan, Noah and Jacob - while none made the top 10 list for girls. TOP 10 BOYS NAMES:. TOP 10 GIRLS NAMES:. That's a stark contrast from 12 years ago when Biblical names dominated the top 10 list, in 2000 it being: Michael, Jacob, Matthew, Joseph, Joshua, and Andrew. For girls in 2000 it was Hannah, Sarah and Elizabeth. If any trend can be seen this year one could blame at least one other book Americans are reading right now. From EL James\u2019 Fifty Shades of Grey, first name Grey shot up 155 spots. Anastasia rose 43 spots and Elliot - Christian Grey's brother - went up by 14 per cent. If any Downtown Abbey fans received visits from the Stork this year, they may be mutually held responsible for an increase in the names Branson (by 32 per cent), Charlie (23 per cent), Elsie (29 per cent), and Daisy (27 per cent). Names Edith, Sybil, Robert, Cora, Isobel and Violet also rose. TV admirers: Names featured in the hit TV show Downtown Abbey also showed a spike with the name Branson, like the character named Tom Branson pictured, seeing a rise by 32 per cent. Perhaps further showing the times - contrasting back when actress Gwyneth Paltrow and Coldplay musician Chris Martin named their baby 'Apple' surprising many who had never heard of the fruit and widespread computer manufacturer used as a name - Apple rose 15 per cent this year. Adding to the Apple iPhone, iPad, iMac buzz, the name Siri \u2013 Apple\u2019s computer generated assistant - climbed by 5 per cent while Mac for boys jumped by 12 per cent. All three names are still deep down on the list, however, with Apple taking 3,204th place, Siri taking 1,427th, and Mac taking 624. Surprise ending: The names Grey, Anastasia and Elliot, featured in the erotic book Fifty Shades of Grey by E L James, pictured, also saw a rise among newborns. Musicians Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's uniquely named Blue Ivy Carter also perhaps stirred a rise in names Blue and Ivy which both saw an increase this year - Blue by 51 per cent and Ivy by 27 per cent. Though Blue is still down on the list hitting 2,571th place, Ivy rose to 157th place. Among this year's most popular names, Aiden tops list of top 10 for the eight year in a row while Sophia continues to hold her own among the girls' 10 for the fifth year running."

A British rugby player has been killed following a hit and run accident, Italian police have confirmed. Brendan Lynch, 26, who played for Gloucester and Rotherham Titans suffered fatal injuries after he was knocked form his Honda SH300 scooter in the early hours of the morning. Mr Lynch had moved to Rome recently and played for Capitolina, the city's main rugby club and he also worked for the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation which is based in the Italian capital. Fatal injuries: Talented rugby player Brendan Lynch, 26, pictured centre with the ball, was knocked from his scooter by a vehicle which then fled the scene, police said. He was considered to be one of the best tighthead props in Italian rugby and was a regular first team player for Capitolina - whose facilities have been used by England for practice ahead of the Six Nations match against Italy. Police said that Mr Lynch's scooter was hit by another car as he travelled on the Rome ring road near Settebagni just to the north of the capital and the vehicle had then sped off leaving him fatally injured by the side of the road. Passing motorists alerted emergency services but he was declared dead at the scene. Traffic police spokesman Roberto Ferilli said: 'We are investigating the circumstances of the accident and are appealing for any witnesses to contact us. 'We are also using cctv footage from the motorway to identify the vehicle. It appears the scooter he was travelling on was hit by another vehicle which failed to stop.' On its website Capitolina paid tribute to Mr Lynch adding that as a mark of respect it was cancelling all training sessions and club activities for 24 hours. Despite being born in Rotherham and having British citizenship Mr Lynch had also played for Ireland's Under 19 thanks to his Irish ancestors. A spokesman for the British Embassy in Rome said: 'I can confirm the death of a British national in a road traffic accident - other than that there is nothing else we can say.' A friend of Mr Lynch's, who asked not to be named, paid tribute to him and said: 'He was a really nice guy, really friendly and always had a smile. 'He enjoyed playing rugby and was a popular member of the club. He will be sadly missed.'"

In 2006, the UK government started to allow universities in England and Wales to charge British students tuition fees. As a result, more than 80 percent of students in England and Wales now take out a student loan in order to go to university. They use the loan to pay for tuition fees and living expenses. Although the interest on student loans is quite low, it begins as soon as the student receives the loan. The average student in England and Wales now graduates from university with a debt of around PS12,000 (122,952 yuan). It means graduates have to struggle to pay rent on a flat, because they have to start paying back the student loan when they reach April after graduating. If you start to earn over PS15,000 (153,630 yuan) a year, the government takes repayments directly from your monthly salary. You might think that a person with a degree would find it easy to get a well-paid job. However, most people in \"white collar jobs\" seem to have a degree, so there is a lot of competition. Also, British companies tend to value work experience over . All of the above is beginning to make British people question whether a university degree is really worth the money. Even before the credit crisis started, the BBC stated: \"The number of British students at UK universities has fallen for the first time in recent history, from 1.97 million in 2007 to 1.96 million last year.\" Meanwhile, the British universities offer more and more of the available places to richer international students rather than poorer British students.

However, the sentence may be ambiguous or potentially misleading, and the intended meaning might not be immediately clear to all readers.\n\nIn this sentence, the structure and word order are in line with English grammar rules. It employs a negative statement (\"No student\") followed by a restrictive relative clause (\"who read anything\") and a main clause (\"passed\"). The negative statement sets the scope of the sentence, while the restrictive relative clause provides additional information about the subject (in this case, \".student\").\n\nLet's break down the sentence structure:\n\n1. \"No student\" serves as the negative subject which refers to a group of people who did not fulfill a certain condition, and \"passed\" stands as the predicate, which denotes the action or state of the subject.\n2. \"who read anything\" is the restrictive relative clause, further defining or providing more specific information about the subject, \"student.\" It is essential for understanding the context and is introduced by the relative pronoun \"who.\"\n\nGiven these elements, the sentence is grammatically correct. However, the meaning might be confusing or ambiguous for some readers, particularly because it appears to be a double-negative statement. Generally, a double-negative statement can be challenging to understand because it can be interpreted differently depending on context and reader's perception.\n\nRegarding the meaning of this particular sentence, there are various potential interpretations:\n\n1. No student who read any material was able to pass: This could indicate that reading led students to fail or that students who read perhaps misunderstood the material.\n\n2. Students who did not read anything passed: Here, the implication might be that students who chose not to read somehow managed to succeed.\n\n3. None of the students who read passed, but the sentence doesn't provide information about the ones who didn't read: This interpretation leaves open the question of whether or not students who didn't read the material passed.\n\nTo clarify the intended meaning, it would be helpful to rephrase the sentence or add further context. For example, \"None of the students who read anything were able to pass the exam\" could provide a clearer indication of what the speaker or writer means.\n\nIn conclusion, while the sentence \"No student who read anything passed\" is grammatically correct according to the rules of English grammar, its meaning is ambiguous and could be interpreted in various ways. To ensure clear communication and accurately convey the intended message, it is often necessary to rephrase ambiguous sentences like this one."

No, the given sentence does not answer the question \"How did Gaddafi die?\" Instead, it provides information about Gaddafi's actions that led to Libya being labeled an \"international pariah.\" It mentions the unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, Gaddafi's support for foreign militants, and his alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing.\n\nTo answer the question about Gaddafi's death, we must explore the events that occurred towards the end of his rule. Muammar Gaddafi, the former Libyan leader, was killed on October 20, 2011, near his hometown of Sirte in Libya. His death was a result of the Libyan Civil War, which was a conflict between Gaddafi's government and various rebel forces that sought to oust him from power.\n\nThe civil war began in February 2011, following the Arab Spring movement that swept across North Africa and the Middle East. The movement led to widespread protests and uprisings against the regimes in countries like Tunisia and Egypt. In Libya, the protests rapidly evolved into an armed conflict between Gaddafi loyalists and anti-Gaddafi rebels.\n\nThe conflict escalated, and the United Nations imposed a no-fly zone over Libya to protect civilians. The situation attracted international intervention. NATO and its partners launched a military campaign called Operation Unified Protector, with the aim of enforcing the no-fly zone and protecting civilians from Gaddafi's forces. This operation significantly weakened Gaddafi's government and military capabilities.\n\nBy August 2011, rebel forces had entered the capital city of Tripoli, and Gaddafi's regime began to collapse. He fled the capital and went into hiding. On October 20, 2011, Gaddafi was discovered by opposition forces hiding in a drainage pipe near Sirte, his hometown.\n\nHe was captured by rebels from the Misrata-based brigade and then violently killed by his captors. Graphic images and videos of the capture and killing were widely circulated around the world, marking the brutal end of Gaddafi's 42-year rule.\n\nIn summary, the sentence provided does not answer the question about Gaddafi's death. Instead, it gives information about events that led to Libya being branded an \"international pariah\" under Gaddafi's rule."

Rachel was very sad and upset because copying someone else's work is wrong. So, she decided to take Tiffanie to court. Court is a place where people go when they have big problems, and a wise person called a judge helps to solve them.\n\nIn court, Rachel told the judge that she had proof Tiffanie copied the parts from her book. You see, when we write things on the computer, it's called an electronic copy. Rachel had an electronic copy of her book and could show the judge how Tiffanie cut and pasted parts from it.\n\nTiffanie told the judge she didn't do anything wrong. She said the idea for her book came from a friend who had a really bad accident and could not talk anymore. But people weren't sure if this was the truth, because it's not nice to blame others, especially if they can't defend themselves.\n\nNow, everyone is waiting for the judge to decide what's fair and right. Rachel hopes the judge will help her fix the problem and teach Tiffanie that copying isn't nice. Remember, kids, it's always good to be honest and do your own work!"

The only difference between them is that Question 2 provides context that this decision was made by the Modi government. Therefore, the answer is:\n2). yes\n\nNow, let's move on to explaining the impact of this decision on the Indian economy:\n\nThe ban on Rs 500 and 1000 notes, also known as demonetization, was implemented by the Indian government with the intent to tackle the issues of corruption, black money, and counterfeit currency. Full analysis would require a deeper study of the subject, but here are some initial potential impacts on the economy:\n\n1. Disruption in cash-based transactions: The sudden ban of these higher denomination notes caused a temporary shortage of cash in circulation. As India is predominantly a cash-driven economy, this affected both businesses and consumers.\n\n2. Increased tax compliance: Demonetization forced people to deposit their high denomination currency notes into banks. This allowed the government to track income and wealth sources, leading to improved tax compliance and potentially higher tax revenue.\n\n3. Shift towards digital payments: Demonetization created an environment where people were encouraged to adopt digital payment methods, reducing the dependency on cash transactions and pushing the economy towards digital transactions and financial inclusion.\n\n4. Impact on GDP growth: The initial disruption from demonetization caused a short-term slowdown in India's economic growth. It was reported that GDP growth slowed in the immediate quarters following the announcement, but later recovered.\n\n5. Inflation: There was a temporary decrease in inflation as cash was in short supply, but this effect was short-lived as liquidity was eventually restored to the market.\n\nWhile there are opposing viewpoints on the long-term benefits of demonetization, the immediate impact included short-term disruption in cash-based transactions, a push towards digital payments, and an increase in tax compliance. The effect on GDP growth and inflation was temporary and normalcy was restored in due course."

Their music is characterised by a fusion of Beatlesque pop, classical arrangements, and futuristic iconography. After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's leader, arranging and producing every album while writing virtually all of their original material. For their initial tenure, Lynne, Bevan and keyboardist Richard Tandy were the group's only consistent members.\n\nFor the next six years, Harvest and Epic/Legacy reissued ELO's back catalogue. Included amongst the remastered album tracks were unreleased songs and outtakes, including two new singles. The first was \"Surrender\" which registered on the lower end of the UK Singles Chart at number 81, some 30 years after it was written in 1976. The other single was \"Latitude 88 North\".  On 9 August 2010, Eagle Rock Entertainment released Live - The Early Years in the UK as a DVD compilation that included Fusion - Live in London (1976) along with never before released live performances at Brunel University (1973) and on a German TV show Rockpalast (1974). The US had a slightly edited release on 24 August 2010. The Essential Electric Light Orchestra artwork was re-jigged to feature two different covers. The US and Australian releases shared one design, while the rest of the world featured the other for a new double album release in October 2011.  Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra was released on 8 October 2012. It is an album of new recordings of ELO's greatest hits by Lynne; along with a new song \"Point of No Return\", released to coincide with Lynne's second solo album release Long Wave. These new 2012 albums contained advertisement cards, announcing the re-release of expanded and remastered versions of both the 2001 album Zoom and Lynne's debut solo album Armchair Theatre, originally released in 1990. Both albums were re-released in April 2013 with various bonus tracks. Also released was the live album, Electric Light Orchestra Live, showcasing songs from the Zoom tour. All three releases also featured new studio recordings as bonus tracks.  Lynne and Tandy reunited again on 12 November 2013 to perform, under the name Jeff Lynne and Friends, \"Livin' Thing\" and \"Mr Blue Sky\" at the Children in Need Rocks concert at Hammersmith Eventim Apollo, London. The backing orchestra was the BBC Concert Orchestra, with Chereene Allen on lead violin."

        "value": "Plant reproduction.\n\nThe formation of an embryo is a crucial step in the process of plant reproduction. When fertilization occurs, the sperm and egg fuse to form a zygote, and this single-celled structure eventually develops into a multicellular embryo. The embryo is surrounded by a protective seed coat and contains the genetic information necessary for the growth and development of a new plant.\n\nIn more detail, plant reproduction can be classified into two types: sexual and asexual reproduction. During sexual reproduction, which involves the fusion of haploid cells from the male and female reproductive structures, the formation of an embryo plays a pivotal role. Here is an outline of the process:\n\n1. Pollination: Pollen grains, containing the male gametes (sperm cells), are transferred from the anther (male reproductive structure) to the stigma (female reproductive structure) of a flower, either through self-pollination or cross-pollination.\n\n2. Fertilization: A pollen tube grows from the pollen grain through the style and into the ovary. The sperm cells travel down the pollen tube, and one of them fuses with the egg cell in the ovule (located inside the ovary), leading to fertilization.\n\n3. Embryo formation: Upon fertilization, the zygote forms and begins to divide, eventually developing into an embryo. The embryo contains a shoot apical meristem, which will give rise to the aerial parts of the plant, and a radicle, which will develop into the plant's root system. Additionally, it contains one or two cotyledons (seed leaves) that serve as the initial food source for the developing seedling.\n\n4. Seed development: The ovule, containing the embryo, transforms into a seed. The outer layer of the ovule becomes the seed coat, which provides protection and helps to prevent germination in unfavorable conditions.\n\n5. Dispersal and germination: Seeds are dispersed by various mechanisms, such as wind, water, or animals, and find suitable conditions to germinate. During germination, the embryo absorbs water, causing the seed coat to rupture, and begins to grow. The radicle emerges first, forming the primary root, followed by the shoot apical meristem, which pushes its way through the soil and develops into the plant's stem and leaves.\n\nIn summary, the formation of an embryo is a fundamental step in the process of plant reproduction. It occurs through the fusion of sperm and egg cells, leading to the development of a new plant from a single-celled zygote into a complex multicellular organism. This process allows for the perpetuation of genetic information and the continuation of plant species across generations."

Due to divisions after World War II, the modern federal state does not cover the entire cultural region of Hesse which includes both the State of Hesse and the area known as Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) in the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate.  - The Order of the Polar Star (Swedish: \"Nordstj\u00e4rneorden\") is a Swedish order of chivalry created by King Frederick I on 23 February 1748, together with the Order of the Sword and the Order of the Seraphim.  - Riksdag of the Estates (formally: ; informally: ) was the name used for the Estates of Sweden when they were assembled. Until its dissolution in 1866, the institution was the highest authority in Sweden next to the king. It was a Diet made up of the Four Estates, which historically were the lines of division in Swedish society:  - The Order of the Sword ( Officially Royal Order of the Sword Swedish Kungliga Sv\u00e4rdsorden ) is a Swedish order of chivalry created by King Frederick I of Sweden on February 23 , 1748 , together with the Order of the Seraphim and the Order of the Polar Star . Awarded to officers , and originally intended as an award for bravery and particularly long or useful service , it eventually became a more or less obligatory award for military officers after a certain number of years in service . There were originally three grades , Knight , Commander and Commander Grand Cross , but these were later multiplied by division into classes . The motto of the order is in Latin : Pro Patria which means For Fatherland .  - A chivalric order, order of chivalry, order of knighthood or equestrian order is an order, confraternity or society of knights typically founded during or in inspiration of the original Catholic military orders of the Crusades (circa 1099-1291), paired with medieval concepts of ideals of chivalry.  - The Great Northern War (170021) was a conflict in which a coalition led by the Tsardom of Russia successfully contested the supremacy of the Swedish Empire in Central, Northern, and Eastern Europe. The initial leaders of the anti-Swedish alliance were Peter the Great of Russia, Frederick IV of DenmarkNorway and Augustus II the Strong of Saxony-Poland. Frederick IV and Augustus II were forced out of the alliance in 1700 and 1706 respectively, but rejoined it in 1709.

Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - Frederick I, , (28 April 1676  5 April 1751) was prince consort of Sweden from 1718 to 1720, and King of Sweden from 1720 until his death and (as \"Frederick I\") also Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel from 1730. He ascended the throne following the death of his brother-in-law, absolutist Charles XII in the Great Northern War, as his sister and heir Ulrika Eleonora preferred to abdicate from her position as queen regnant after relinquishing most powers to the Riksdag of the Estates. His powerless reign saw his family's elimination from the line of succession after the parliamentary government dominated by pro-revanchist Hat Party politicians ventured into a war with Russia, which ended in defeat and the Russian tsarina Elizabeth demanding Adolph Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp to be instated following the death of the king.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

Shelton began singing at an early age and by the age of 12, he was taught how to play the guitar by his uncle. By age 15, he had written his first song. By age 16, he had received a Denbo Diamond Award in his home state.\nContext: Shelton released his fourth studio album, Pure BS, in early 2007. Unlike with his first three albums, which were produced entirely by Bobby Braddock, Shelton worked with Braddock, Brent Rowan, and Paul Worley as producers for this album. Its first two singles--\"Don't Make Me\" and \"The More I Drink\"--were both Top 20 hits on the country charts, respectively reaching No.12 and No. 19. Also in late 2007, Shelton made appearances on television shows: first as a judge on the talent competition Nashville Star, and later on Clash of the Choirs.  Pure BS was re-released in 2008 with three bonus tracks, including a cover of Michael Buble's hit single \"Home\". This cover, released in early 2008 as the album's third single, became his fourth No.1 hit in July.  \"Home\" was followed in August 2008 by the single \"She Wouldn't Be Gone\", his 14th chart entry and his fifth No. 1 hit. It was the first time in his career that he had two consecutive number ones. \"She Wouldn't Be Gone\" is the lead-off to Shelton's fifth studio album, Startin' Fires, which has also produced the single \"I'll Just Hold On.\" This album also includes \"Bare Skin Rug,\" a duet with Lambert. It was produced by Scott Hendricks, except for one track which was produced by Brent Rowan, and another (\"I Don't Care\", which carried over from Pure BS) was produced by Braddock. After \"I'll Just Hold On\" fell off the chart in October 2009, Blake Shelton released a duet with Trace Adkins titled \"Hillbilly Bone\". It was the lead single on Shelton's EP, Hillbilly Bone, released on March 2, 2010 through Reprise Records Nashville. After \"Hillbilly Bone\" reached No. 1 in February, came the August release of \"All About Tonight\", the lead-off single to his EP of the same name. In September, he released the second single from All About Tonight, \"Who Are You When I'm Not Looking\", his 18th single release. He released his first greatest hits album, Loaded: The Best of Blake Shelton in November 2010.  Shelton was invited to join the Grand Ole Opry during the September 28, 2010 \"Country Comes Home\" concert celebrating reopening of the Grand Ole Opry House after the Cumberland River flooded the Opry House in May 2010. The formal invitation was extended on his Twitter account and was announced by Opry star Trace Adkins. He was formally inducted by Adkins at the October 23, 2010 Opry performance. Shelton recorded the title track for the remake of Footloose released on October 14, 2011. Shelton appeared on the 44th Annual Country Music Awards on November 10, 2010 where he performed \"All About Tonight\" and won Male Vocalist of the Year.  In 2011, Shelton started working as a judge/coach to singers on the NBC reality television series The Voice.\nQuestion: What Michael Buble song was covered?"

The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide. The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas. These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States. It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets. Enron North America-Upstream Products Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production. The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities. In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu. Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system. ENA West Power Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002. With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators.

In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of Animals originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable, Animal Farm. The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig.The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for \"Dogs\", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part \"Pigs on the Wing\". Wright commented: \"It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there.\" Mason recalled: \"Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately.\" Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. Animals is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: \"Animals ... wasn't a fun record to make ... this was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that [we] were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me.\"Released in January 1977, the album peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three.

        "value": "The most important words in the sentence \"steam train pulling through the countryside\" are:\n\n1. Steam train\n2. Pulling\n3. Countryside\n\nHere's a detailed explanation for each word:\n\n1. Steam train: This phrase refers to a specific type of train that is powered by steam, which is an important detail in understanding the essence of the sentence. Steam trains have historical significance as they were used extensively in the 19th and early 20th centuries before giving way to diesel and electric locomotives. They represent the progress and growth of rail transportation during that period, and by including this word, the sentence conveys an image of a classic, vintage form of transportation and possibly a nostalgic experience for some.\n\n2. Pulling: The action word \"pulling\" refers to the motion of the train, indicating that it is actively moving forward and transporting something, either passengers or cargo. Pulling is an essential aspect of a train's core purpose \u2013 to transport people and goods from one location to another. It is also significant to note that trains can only move in a linear path along the tracks, which restricts their range of motion compared to other land vehicles. The word \"pulling\" imparts a sense of the train's power and determination to overcome any obstacles while navigating through various landscapes.\n\n3. Countryside: The term \"countryside\" provides the setting for the train's journey and adds depth to the imagery portrayed in the sentence. By specifying that the steam train is moving through the countryside, the sentence paints a picture of a peaceful, picturesque environment, perhaps filled with rolling hills, green fields, and quaint villages. This sets a particular mood and atmosphere, contrasting to the bustle and noise of a city or the barrenness of a desert. The juxtaposition of a steam train traveling through the countryside might also suggest a connection between the industrial revolution and rural communities or a romantic sense of adventure and exploration in a bygone era."

In fact, the most notable development in the case prior to trial sent a contrary signal: the court denied the Mayor\u2019s post-discovery summary judgment motion as to the plaintiffs\u2019 central political discrimination claim. While the fact that a claim has survived summary judgment is not, on its own, \u201centitled to decretory significance,\u201d Foster, 943 F.2d at 144, it has some value in determining whether a claim was or became unreasonable or without foundation. See id.; Walker v. NationsBank of Fla. N.A., 53 F.3d 1548, 1559 (11th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>); Jensen v.

The sentence reflects an internal conflict within the speaker, as they can intellectually understand why this may be the case, but emotionally, it is difficult for them to accept.\n\nSentence 2:\nThe speaker expresses the belief that people can be hypocritical when they are religious. This sentence indicates the speaker's general opinion about religious individuals\u2014specifically, that they can be hypocritical in their actions compared to their professed beliefs.\n\nThe connection between the two sentences lies in their focus on the inconsistencies and challenges experienced by religious people. Though the first sentence does not directly entail the second, both sentences are related to religious beliefs and the internal struggles that may arise in reconciling those beliefs with the realities of human interactions. The first sentence expresses a desire for unity among people who share similar beliefs, while the second sentence provides a possible explanation (hypocrisy) for why such unity might not always be achieved.\n\nIn summary, although the second sentence is not entailed directly by the first sentence, both sentences are linked through their exploration of the complexities of religious beliefs and their impact on human behavior and unity."

More rest (a few weeks) may be needed depending on the severity of your back injury. For a backache, laying on your back with your knees bent and legs slightly elevated is a good idea because it can take the pressure off the low back joints and provide some pain relief.  Laying on your back for hours at a time is not a good idea, either. Get up at least once an hour to move around even a little bit, and try going for a leisurely walk every day. Avoid excessive sitting (more than 30 minutes at a time) because it puts more pressure on the low back joints and may further irritate them. Cold therapy (ice wrapped in a thin towel or frozen gel packs) should be applied to the injury as soon as possible in order to stop reduce inflammation. Ice should be applied for 10 \u2013 15 minutes every hour, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside. Compressing the ice against your back will help to further combat the inflammation.  Backaches from joint sprains are usually described as sharp and shooting in nature and they tend to be fairly debilitating. Most range of motion in the affected area is lost, and walking, sitting and sleeping are noticeably impaired. People with spinal joint sprains usually walk hunched over and to the side because the muscles surrounding the affected joints quickly spasm to \"guard\" the injury. Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists that focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae, called spinal facet joints. Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition facet joints that are slightly misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain, particularly with movement. You can often hear a \"popping\" sound with a spinal adjustment, similar in concept to when you extend your knuckles. Traction techniques or stretching of your spine may also help.  Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your back sprain, more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results. If uneven leg lengths or flat feet is deemed to be the primary cause of your backache, then your doctor or chiropractor may recommend orthotics, which are custom made shoe inserts that support the arches, promote better biomechanics when running or walking, and help alleviate back pain. A facet joint injection involves real-time fluoroscopic (X-ray) guidance of a needle through the back muscles and into the inflamed or irritated spinal joint, followed by a release of an anesthetic and corticosteroid mixture, which quickly relieves both pain and inflammation at the site. Facet joint injections take 20 \u2013 30 minutes to do and the results can last from a few weeks to a few months.  Facet joint injections are limited to three within a six-month time frame. The pain relief benefits from facet joint injections typically begin on the second or third day post treatment. Until that time frame, your backache may get a little worse."

Often, they don't know they possess the gift.Mortimer Folchart (Brendan Fraser) is one of these \"Silvertongues.\" In an opening shot, we see Mortimer (or 'Mo' as he's called by some) sitting with his wife, Resa (Sienna Guillory). They try to calm their baby girl down for bed, so Mo picks a book to read: Little Red Riding Hood. As he is reading aloud, things shake and move slightly (only noticed by Mo), and a red riding hood falls into the back yard onto their clothesline.Twelve years later, Mo and his daughter, Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennet), are on their way to another old bookshop (as always, because Meggie expresses the wish to go to modern bookshops where they can have hot coco, etc.) in Germany. But Mo loves old books. Meggie says that maybe he will find the old book he is always looking for. Apparently, he always scours every corner of old bookshops looking for a very specific old book that he has never been able to find. Mo heads into an old shop while Meggie waits outside in the street looking at other books.Mo introduces himself to the shop owner, who recognizes him as \"that famous book doctor!\" He brings out one old book for Mo to fix, which he says he can. The owner invites him to look around at all the old books that he has, and Mo wanders off to the back. As he wanders, he hears whispered lines coming from the book. He hears a specific voice, one he obviously recognizes, and he finds and pulls a copy of \"Inkheart\" from the shelves. He opens it up, and begins to skim through the book's pages.Outside, a ferret shows up at Meggie's feet. He has tiny horns, and he tries to bite her when she offers him a piece of her sandwich. Behind her, a man, standing next to fire, calls the ferret (named Gwin) to him and talks to Meggie for a moment.

I always thought people's taking pictures of their food was kind of silly, but at this new  pop-up restaurant in the UK, I'd probably do it too. 'The Picture House' is the world's first pay-by-photo restaurant--you order, click a photo of the food, share on Instagram and eat for free! The restaurant belongs to frozen food giant   Birds Eye, who came up with the idea to cash in on people's addiction with photographing food and sharing the pictures online. They conducted a survey and found out that more than half of the British population regularly took pictures of their meals. So they realized it was a better way to advertise their new dining range. The pop-up diner was open in Soho, London for three days in May, and is now moving to other major UK cities. They serve two-course meals that customers don't have to pay for, if they photo and Instagram it. The restaurant is a part of Birds Eye's 'Food for Life' campaign, a new marketing project that aims at changing the way people look at frozen food. \"Taking photos of food enables people to show off and to share their mealtime moments--from the everyday to the special,\" said marketing director Margaret Jobling. The reaction to The Picture House has been great so far. And the pay-by-picture concept has proven to be an effective way.

Nicole Vaisey, 25, and boyfriend Stephen Howells II, 39, were named in a five-count indictment in Syracuse. The charges included conspiracy to sexually exploit the two Amish girls along with a third female minor, according to a statement released by U.S. Attorney Richard Hartunian. Howells also was charged with possession of child pornography. The pair had previously been charged with the kidnapping of the two Amish girls -- ages 6 and 12 -- about 50 miles from the Canadian border on August 13. \"This indictment charges Howells and Vaisey with enticing and coercing children to engage in sexual conduct and making a video recording of it,\" Hartunian said in a statement. Vaisey and Howells both face a maximum of 30 years in prison on the sexual exploitation charges against children. Howells faces a maximum of 20 years on the child pornography charge. If convicted, both could be fined up to $250,000 on each count. The pair also faces criminal court charges of first-degree kidnapping after luring the young Amish girls into a car with a puppy, authorities in New York's St. Lawrence County said. Details about the abduction in Oswegatchie emerged during a preliminary hearing in St. Lawrence County in August. Detective Sgt. Brooks Bigwarfe detailed the couples' alleged plan and kidnapping of the girls, as related to him by Vaisey. Vaisey told investigators that she and Howells were on a \"shopping trip\" for \"slaves\" when they allegedly kidnapped the girls. \"They had been planning this for several weeks,\" Bigwarfe said. The girls were picked up at a vegetable stand outside a family farm. Howells and Vaisey pulled up to the stand in a location where they couldn't be seen, and waited for the girls to approach the car, Bigwarfe said. Howells allegedly scouted out the stand the previous week. Howells asked the girls whether they wanted to pet the dog, a Doberman pinscher-golden retriever mix named Kaleidoscope, police said. When the older child grew suspicious, Bigwarfe said, Howells pushed the girls into the back of the car. \"When he started forcing them into the vehicle, they were both screaming and yelling,\" Bigwarfe said. The girls were held captive for nearly 24 hours, during which they were handcuffed together, shackled to a bed and sexually abused, according to the sheriff's department. With widening media coverage, a large police response in the area and an Amber Alert, the couple began to worry and decided it was too risky to keep the girls, he said. Howells abandoned the two girls in an isolated area 12 miles from where they were being held, Bigwarfe said. Attorneys for Vaisey and Howell did not immediately return calls seeking comment. After her August arrest, Vaisey's attorney, Bradford Riendeau, told CNN that his client was allegedly in a master-slave relationship with Howells and that she was not the mastermind of the planned kidnapping.\nWhat are the important parts of this article?"

The effects of an ipsilateral injection of etomidate on the functional properties of contralateral hemisphere are not known. Our aim was to characterize the electroencephalographic (EEG) effects after intracarotid injection of etomidate and to determine the changes in synchronization between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres.', 'We retrospectively analyzed EEG data from 15 patients who underwent Wada test with etomidate. Continuous EEG data from 4 electrodes (2 anterior [F3, F4] and 2 posterior [P3, P4]) were analyzed. After artifact rejection, we measured the amplitudes of delta (1 to 4 Hz) and alpha (7 to 13 Hz) waves and the changes in the interhemispheric synchronization before, during, and after etomidate injection.', 'Ipsilateral injection of etomidate causes EEG changes in both hemispheres with increased amplitude of delta waves anteriorly and the alpha waves posteriorly. However this effect of etomidate is not uniform. Although there was a decrease in the interhemispheric synchronization of delta waves, there was no change in the synchronization of the alpha waves.\nAnswer: Our study showed that the EEG effects of intracarotid ipsilateral injection of etomidate is not uniform in both hemispheres. Decrease in the interhemispheric synchronization of delta waves might serve as an indicator of ipsilateral effect of etomidate on the brain. Additional studies are needed to confirm our findings."

But within hours, Atheel al-Nujaifi was forced to flee before the provincial government's headquarters was overrun by hundreds of men armed with rocket-propelled grenades, sniper rifles and machine-guns.\nBy Tuesday, tens of thousands of residents had left for the nearby Kurdish-controlled region as the militants seized Mosul's airport, army operations centre and other installations. They also set fire to police stations and freed hundreds of detainees. Police and soldiers dropped their weapons and abandoned their posts as the assault became a rout.\nConvoys of militants moved southwards on Wednesday, first attacking the town of Baiji and then reportedly overrunning Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, the administrative capital of Salahuddin province.\nIn pictures: Iraqis flee Mosul\nProfile: Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS)\nMosul is the second city to fall to ISIS this year, after Falluja. However, its loss is much more serious for the government, as it is the main city of northern Iraq and a major political and economic centre, with a population of 1.8 million. It is also a gateway to Syria and Turkey.\nAfter the US-led invasion in 2003, Mosul became a bastion of resistance to the occupation, which its Sunni Arab majority opposed and Kurdish minority supported. Years of bombings and shootings by militants linked to al-Qaeda led to an exodus of thousands of people.\nIt was not until 2009 that a semblance of normality returned to Mosul, but jihadists maintained a firm hold. Sectarian violence increased after US troops withdrew in 2011. It has surged since early 2013 when Shia Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's government launched an offensive against ISIS while also moving against Sunni opposition figures and protesters.\nAnalysis: How to recover Iraq's second city\nParagliding in Mosul, a way to shake off recent past\nThe prime minister has pressed parliament to declare a 30-day state of emergency that would give security forces the \"necessary powers\" to regain control.\nA vote will be held on Thursday. Mr Maliki also said citizens would be armed to fight the militants.\nThe sudden collapse of the security forces in Mosul alarmed the US. It called on the Iraqi government to \"step up to the plate\", warning that ISIS was \"a threat to the entire region\". It pledged to help Baghdad \"push back this aggression\".\nThe Iraqi government is believed to have about 930,000 security personnel under its command, so on paper they ought to be able to easily overcome the hundreds of militants who attacked Mosul.\nHowever, the same might have been said in late December after ISIS militants and allied tribesmen seized parts of Ramadi, the capital of the western province of Anbar, and most of the nearby city of Falluja amid clashes triggered by the clearance of two protest camps.\nMr Maliki has vowed to crush the militants, but they are still in control six months on, holding off troops. The UN says the fighting in Anbar has displaced some 480,000 people.\nSoldiers have become disillusioned by the conflict against ISIS and brutal attacks by the group - including beheadings and crucifixions - leading many to desert. Commanders told the New York Times they were losing as many as 300 soldiers a day to desertions, deaths and injuries.\nAnalysis: Anbar violence goes beyond sectarian conflict\nViolence in Iraq sparks new sectarian displacement\nQuick guide: Sunnis and Shias\nIn 2009, then CIA Director Michael Hayden said al-Qaeda was \"on the verge of a strategic defeat in Iraq\". Today, its successor controls territories stretching for hundreds of miles through Nineveh, Anbar and into Syria, where it hopes to establish an Islamic state.\nISIS has gained strength and momentum from the situation in Syria, from where it has transferred recruits, sophisticated weapons and resources to fight in Iraq since 2012.\nIt has also skilfully exploited the political stand-off between the central government and the minority Sunni Arab community, which complains that Mr Maliki is monopolising power and targeting them by pursuing policies like the mass arrests in the name of fighting terrorism.\nAccording to the UN, more than 8,860 people were killed in Iraq in 2013 - the highest number of deaths since the peak of the sectarian insurgency between 2006 and 2008. So far this year, more than 4,700 have died.\nIraq: Bloodshed and strife cast pall over polls\nIraq: A proxy battleground in a regional war"

With a population of over 1.381\u00a0billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - Romance of the Three Kingdoms, attributed to Luo Guanzhong, is a historical novel set in the turbulent years towards the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280.  - A courtesy name (\"zi\"), also known as a style name, is a name bestowed upon one at adulthood in addition to one's given name. This practice is a tradition in East Asian cultures, including China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.  - The Qin dynasty was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland of Qin, in modern-day Gansu and Shaanxi, the dynasty was formed after the conquest of six other states by the Qin state, and its founding emperor named Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States to gain control over the whole of China. It is also the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors.  - Zhang Ling (34156), courtesy name Fuhan, was an Eastern Han Dynasty Taoist figure credited with founding the Way of the Celestial Masters sect of Taoism, which is also known as the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice.  - Emperor Gaozu of Han (256 BC  June 1, 195 BC), born Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202  195 BC. He was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history with humble origin from the peasant class.  - Zhang Liang ( died 184 ) was a Yellow Turban rebel leader during the late Han Dynasty period of Chinese history . He was a younger brother of Zhang Jiao and Zhang Bao , the other two key leaders of the rebellion . He was said to be an able general . It is said that Zhang Liang is the grandson of Zhang Daoling . In Luo Guanzhong 's historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms , it is said that he went to the altar , and caused a rock attack against imperial forces . Zhang Liang and Zhang Bao split the army of Zhang Jiao after his death . He fought seven successive battles against imperial forces but was repelled each time and fled back to Quyang . On the seventh retreat he was captured by general Huangfu Song and killed . Zhang Bao would soon suffer a similar fate at the hands of his own men and the Yellow Turbans would quickly degenerate into nothing more than scattered bandit forces led by leaders such as He Yi and Zhang Yan . By 205 the movement ceased most of its military activities .  - Wang Mang (c. 45  6 October 23\u00a0AD), courtesy name Jujun (), was a Han Dynasty official who seized the throne from the Liu family and founded the Xin (or Hsin, meaning \"renewed\") Dynasty (), ruling 923 AD. The Han dynasty was restored after his overthrow, and his rule marks the separation between the Western Han Dynasty (before Xin) and Eastern Han Dynasty (after Xin). Some historians have traditionally viewed Wang as a usurper, while others have portrayed him as a visionary and selfless social reformer. Though a learned Confucian scholar who sought to implement the harmonious society he saw in the classics, his efforts ended in chaos.  - The Way of the Five Pecks of Rice or the Way of the Celestial Master, commonly abbreviated to simply The Celestial Masters, was a Chinese Taoist movement founded by the first Celestial Master Zhang Daoling in 142 CE. At its height, the movement controlled a theocratic state in the Hanzhong valley, north of Sichuan. In 215 CE, the state was incorporated into Cao Cao's Kingdom of Wei, and the followers of the Celestial Master were dispersed all over China.  - The history of Chinese literature extends thousands of years, from the earliest recorded dynastic court archives to the mature vernacular fiction novels that arose during the Ming Dynasty to entertain the masses of literate Chinese. The introduction of widespread woodblock printing during the Tang Dynasty (618907) and the invention of movable type printing by Bi Sheng (9901051) during the Song Dynasty (9601279) rapidly spread written knowledge throughout China. In more modern times, the author Lu Xun (18811936) is considered the founder of \"baihua\" literature in China.  - The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \"Three Kingdoms\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \"Three Kingdoms\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu.  - The Xin dynasty was a Chinese dynasty (termed so despite having only one emperor) which lasted from 9 to 23 AD. It interrupted the Han dynasty, dividing it into the periods of the Western Han and the Eastern Han.  - Luo Ben (c. 13301400, or c.12801360), better known by his courtesy name Guanzhong, was a Chinese writer who lived during the Yuan and Ming periods. He was also known by his pseudonym Huhai Sanren. Luo was attributed with writing \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" and editing \"Water Margin\", the first two of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature.  - The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \"Han people\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \"Han characters\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC  9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220\u00a0AD).

These institutions serve as essential marketplaces of ideas, history, and creative expression by providing a space where people can learn, explore, and connect with the past and present.\n\nLibraries, in particular, are vital community hubs that offer access to an array of books, publications, and digital resources. They provide both educational and recreational opportunities for people of all ages, from storytimes and reading programs for children to adult classes and workshops. Moreover, libraries often facilitate public discussions, author events, and exhibitions that help expand knowledge and encourage civil discourse among community members.\n\nMuseums, on the other hand, aim to preserve and interpret elements of the past for the benefit of present and future generations. Through their engaging exhibits and collections, museums showcase various aspects of our shared human history, including art, science, culture, and nature. By doing so, museums provide valuable insights into the human experience and help foster respect and understanding among diverse communities.\n\nOther cultural activities include theaters, concert halls, galleries, and many more artistic establishments that contribute to the enrichment of our cultural lives. These spaces allow artists to showcase their creativity, inspire thought and emotion, and celebrate the human spirit. Furthermore, these cultural activities spur creativity and intellectual curiosity, fostering personal growth, and providing a space for communal experiences.\n\nThe cultural activities market thrives on the exchange of ideas, inspiration, education, and enjoyment. People are drawn to these institutions, eager to learn, engage, and satisfy their intellectual curiosity. In the context of our constantly evolving society, maintaining a wide variety of cultural resources is paramount, as it helps in the understanding of both the world and ourselves.\n\nThese institutions also contribute to the economy, both locally and nationally. They generate revenue through ticket sales, sponsorship, and donations that help fund operating costs, staff wages, and events. Additionally, cultural attractions often stimulate economic growth in surrounding areas by stimulating tourism and giving nearby businesses, such as cafes and gift shops, a boost.\n\nFurthermore, libraries, museums, and other cultural activities serve as important educational resources. They provide opportunities for formal and informal learning, from guided tours to self-directed exploration, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In many cases, these institutions partner with schools and educational organizations, helping to supplement and enrich classroom education.\n\nLastly, cultural activities help establish a sense of local identity. By promoting the heritage and artistic achievements of a community, these institutions instill a sense of pride and belonging among residents. They also contribute to a higher quality of life, as vibrant cultural scenes often attract new residents, businesses, and further investment in a locality.\n\nIn conclusion, libraries, museums, and other cultural activities play an essential role in society by nurturing intellectual curiosity, fostering a sense of belonging, and enhancing the overall quality of life. As marketplaces of ideas and knowledge, they not only contribute to personal growth and development but also help support local economies and promote a richer, more diverse cultural landscape."

Small-minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet American's friendliness and helpfulness is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment. For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the families who generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of distraction, and brought news of the outside world. The tough realities of the border also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest settler agent. It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or only a charitable impulse   on the part of the settlers. It reflected the hardship of daily life: if you didn't take in the stranger and take care of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might be in the same situation. Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the exhausted traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist routes. \"I was just traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for dinner, amazing.\" Such observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood properly.

Article: A young man approached the foreman of a logging crew   and asked for a job. \"That depends,\" replied the foreman. \"Let's see you fell   this tree.\" The young man stepped forward and skillfully felled a great tree. Impressed, the foreman said, \"You can start Monday.\" Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday went by -- and on Thursday afternoon the foreman approached the young man and said, \"You can pick up your wages on the way out today.\" Shocked, the young man replied, \"I thought you would pay me on Friday.\" \"Normally we do,\" said the foreman. \"But we're letting you go today because you've fallen behind. Our daily felling charts show that you've dropped from first place on Monday to the last place today.\" \"But I'm quite hardworking,\" the young man disagreed. \"I am the first to arrive and the last to leave and even have worked through my coffee breaks!\" The foreman thought for a minute and then asked \"Have you sharpened your axe?\" The young man replied, \"No, sir. I've been working too hard to take time for that!\" Our lives are like that. We sometimes get so busy that we don't take time to \"sharpen\" the axe. In today's world it seems that everyone is busier than ever, but less happy than ever. Why is that? Could it be that we have forgotten how to stay sharp? There's nothing wrong with hard work. But we shouldn't get so busy that we ignore the truly important things in life. We all need time to relax, to think, to learn and to grow. If we don't take time to sharpen the axe, we will become dull and lose our effectiveness. Question: What can we learn about the young man? Options: A: He is optimistic. B: He is a little dishonest. C: He is intelligent. D: He is hardworking."

Upon meeting a young sex worker named Lana, played by Rebecca De Mornay, they devise a plan to turn Joel's luxurious suburban home into a temporary brothel, all in the name of financial profit and indulgence in adult pleasures.\n\nThe film is often remembered for its iconic scenes and memorable moments, such as the one in which Tom Cruise performs an exuberant dance routine in his underwear to the song \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" by Bob Seger. However, beneath its comedic surface, \"Risky Business\" also explores themes of existential freedom and the consequences of our choices, as well as the growing pains associated with adolescence and the transition into adulthood.\n\nUpon its release, the movie received critical acclaim, especially for Cruise's engaging performance, and has gone on to become a cult classic. In addition to launching Tom Cruise's career, \"Risky Business\" has entered popular culture as a symbol of 1980s cinema and teen rebellion, while simultaneously exploring the darker side of the American Dream."

It serves as an outlet for the river Akerselva. Since the 2000s, it has been undergoing urban redevelopment, being transformed from a container port. When completed, the Bj\u00f8rvika neighborhood will be a new cultural and urban center in Oslo. The multi-purpose medium-rises of the Barcode Project is nearing its completion to the north; to the east the residential area of S\u00f8renga is under construction. The National Opera is located at Bj\u00f8rvika, and both the Oslo Public Library and the Munch/Stenersen museum is currently under construction here, the latter replacing the existing Munch Museum in 2020.   - Akerselva or Akerselven ( English : Aker River ) is a river which flows through Oslo . It starts at Maridalsvannet in Oslomarka , and follows the urban areas Nordre Aker , Sagene , Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka , Oslo centre and Gr\u00f8nland , whereby it finally ends at Paulsenkaien and Oset in Bj\u00f8rvika . The river is considered to be a part of the Nordmarkvassdraget , and has the watercourse number 006.Z . The entire river is about 8.2 kilometres ( 5.1 mi ) long , and has a difference in elevation between source and mouth of approximately 149 metres ( 489 ft ) . Earlier , the river gave power to numerous industry companies in Oslo . Akerselven is `` Oslo 's green lung '' ; many parks and nature trails are to be found by its path , from Gr\u00f8nland to Maridalsvannet .

Salmon run and spawn in the upper part of the river . Aker River in the 1970s was heavily contaminated after 150 years of industrial and sewage discharges along river . In the 1980s , a local initiative to limit emissions and revive the flora and fauna of the river began . Early in March 2011 , Oslo 's water and wastewater department accidentally discharged 6,000 litres ( 1,600 US gal ) of chlorine into the river near its headwaters , rendering the river virtually dead as of 11 March 2011 . According to Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation , the discharge occurred at the water treatment plant Oset .  - The Oslofjord is an inlet in the south-east of Norway, stretching from an imaginary line between the Torbj\u00f8rnskj\u00e6r and F\u00e6rder lighthouses and down to Langesund in the south to Oslo in the north. It is part of the Skagerrak strait, connecting the North Sea and the Kattegat sea area, which leads to the Baltic Sea. The Oslofjord is not a fjord in the geological sense - in Norwegian the term \"fjord\" can refer to a wide range of waterways. The bay is divided into the inner (\"indre\") and outer (\"ytre\") Oslofjord at the point of the Dr\u00f8bak Sound.

The Super Ball is made from a unique, bouncy material known as Zectron, which was first invented by chemist Norman Stingley in the 1960s. It consists of a compressed rubber compound that exhibits a very high coefficient of restitution, allowing it to bounce extremely high and with incredible energy. Due to its impressive bouncing capabilities, the Super Ball quickly gained popularity among children and became a staple toy in many households.\n\nOne of the key aspects that make the Super Ball so enjoyable for children is its ability to bounce unpredictably, adding an element of surprise and excitement to their playtime. The unpredictable nature of the ball's bounce stems from its high resilience, which causes it to rebound off of surfaces in erratic directions. This quality encourages children to engage in active play, as they attempt to catch the ball or predict where it will bounce next.\n\nAdditionally, the Super Ball's versatility allows it to be incorporated into various games and activities. It can be used for traditional games like catch, or as a prop in imaginative scenarios created by children during playtime. Over the years, numerous variations of the Super Ball have been introduced, with different colors, designs, and sizes, all of which have contributed to its ongoing popularity amongst children.\n\nIn summary, the Super Ball is a popular toy that children enjoy due to its exceptional bouncing properties and versatility, providing excitement and stimulating their imaginations during playtime."

Rake your fingers, excluding your pointer and middle finger, and fold them into your palm like you are making a fist. Make sure your thumb is over your other fingers. Raise your index and middle fingers. The index finger is the closest finger to your thumb. It doesn\u2019t matter which hand you use. This is how you make the standard peace sign with your hand, Your extended index and middle fingers should form a \u201cV.\u201d Keep your clenched fingers and palm pointed away from your body. This is very important.  When you keep your palm facing inward toward yourself, the gesture can be perceived as offensive in some cultures, almost a double middle finger. Make sure you put your pointer finger and your middle finger out at the same time. If you put your middle finger out first it can mean something very bad in English (and in many other languages). Don't stick out your little finger; this, too, has an alternate, obscene interpretation. When done correctly, the peace sign became a counter-cultural symbol of peace in the Vietnam War.  Most people raise their hand in the air while making it.  Some people consider the meaning of the symbol to be a call for an end to war, and some people think of it as a general call for peace in the world. Some politicians have made the sign with both hands while raising both arms (Richard Nixon, Dwight Eisenhower). This can be a cliche, though, that brings to mind Nixon. Many people just raise one arm when making the sign. When some people see the peace sign, they think of it as a \u201cV\u201d sign that means victory, especially in war. The V sign is also made by holding up the two fingers closest to the thumb in a V formation.  It doesn\u2019t matter which hand you use. Allied troops started using this hand sign to indicate victory during World War II.  Winston Churchill used the sign to indicate victory. So did Nixon, in the context of Vietnam. Protesters who were against Vietnam then started using the same sign and saying \u201cpeace\u201d as they did it instead, to protest the war. They wanted to change the hand gesture to a symbol of peace. The point is to be aware that the hand signal has both a history in the anti-war movement and in representing victory during war. This sign is another hand signal that derived from the television show, Star Trek. Its meaning is \u201clive long and prosper.\u201d  To make it, press together the two fingers closest to your thumb at the same time you press together the two fingers farthest away from your thumb. The middle of your hand will form the \u201cV\u201d shape when you do this with your fingers. You should keep your thumb extended outward as you do so. Historically, the Vulcan was a pagan deity, a sun god who was linked to powerful energy such as thunderbolts."

Under the patronage of the famous Medici family, Botticelli quickly gained recognition for his artistic talents and went on to create some of the most iconic and captivating works of the Renaissance.\n\nThe Tragedy of Lucretia showcases Botticelli's skill in employing vivid colors, intricate details, and powerful storytelling in his artwork. Lucretia was a legendary Roman woman whose tragic story is told in Roman historical accounts and has been the subject of numerous artworks throughout history.\n\nThe scene depicted in Botticelli's painting is one of great tragedy and emotional intensity. According to the ancient Roman legend, Lucretia was raped by Sextus Tarquinius, the son of the ruling king. After revealing the horrific event to her family and expressing her dishonor, Lucretia took her own life. Her tragic death would ultimately lead to the establishment of the Roman Republic, as the outraged citizens rebelled against the ruling monarchy.\n\nIn Botticelli's rendition of this tragic tale, the despair and anguish of Lucretia and her family members are captured through their vivid expressions and gestures. The painting not only conveys the emotional turmoil of the scene but also reflects Botticelli's mastery of rendering detailed human figures, drapery, and complex narratives in his works.\n\nIsabella Stewart Gardner, an American art collector, philanthropist, and patron of the arts, owned the painting during her lifetime. Born in 1840 in New York City, Gardner developed an extensive art collection, which she displayed in her Venetian-style palazzo in Boston. When she passed away in 1924, her museum was established as per her will and the extensive art collection, including The Tragedy of Lucretia, became available for public viewing.\n\nToday, The Tragedy of Lucretia remains an impressive example of Italian Renaissance art, serving as a testament to the exceptional skill of Sandro Botticelli. Its presence at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum continues to allow visitors to appreciate the extraordinary talent of this prominent Renaissance master."

Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\na). no.\n\nLet's analyze each sentence to understand their differences:\n\nSentence 1: Digital built a very large facility on King Street near the Common, as well as offices on Porter Road and Foster Street.\n\nIn this sentence, it is mentioned that Digital constructed a significant facility on King Street, which is located close to the Common. Additionally, the company built offices on two other streets: Porter Road and Foster Street. From this sentence, we can infer that the major facility is separate from the offices, with the large facility being situated on King Street, while the offices are spread across Porter Road and Foster Street.\n\nSentence 2: Digital built a very large facility in Porter Road and Foster Street near the Common, as well as offices on King Street.\n\nIn contrast, this sentence states that the very large facility is located between Porter Road and Foster Street, in the vicinity of the Common. Moreover, the company also built offices on King Street. Here, we can gather that the main facility and the offices are situated in different locations compared to Sentence 1. The large facility is set between Porter Road and Foster Street, whereas the offices are established on King Street.\n\nIn summary, while both sentences describe the construction of a large facility and offices by Digital, the locations of these facilities differ in each sentence. Consequently, they do not convey the same information."

In the UK, they have devastated common frog populations.\nThis research suggests that the introduction of infected animals from aquatic retailers into ponds or moving species between different ponds may be exacerbating the problem.\nThe findings are published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\nDr Trent Garner, from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), told BBC News: \"The virus seems to be spreading at a rate that exceeds the ability of a frog to hop, and there seems to be human-aided dispersal of the virus.\"\nRanaviruses are a group of viruses found across the world and they affect different species in different ways.\nIn the UK, one type of ranavirus was found to be present in the South East of England in the 1980s, and it has since spread.\nIt can kill common frogs either by causing sores and blisters to form on the animal's skin or by causing their internal organs to bleed.\n\"In a certain proportion of populations, the disease persists. And when it persists, frogs decline by around 85%, and they don't seem to be recovering,\" said Dr Garner.\nTo analyse the movement of the disease in the UK, scientists looked at two decades of data recorded by a citizen science scheme called the Frog Mortality Project, which is now coordinated through  Garden Wildlife Health.\nGenetic records suggested that ranavirus was not always present in the UK, and had probably been introduced to the UK on two separate occasions.\nThe study also found that while infection is spread by the natural movement of amphibians, garden ponds could also be playing a key role.\nDr Garner said: \"Potentially garden ponds can act as stepping stones for infected animals to move around and reach new sites.\"\nHe said that taking frogspawn or frogs from one pond and placing them in another could be helping to spread ranavirus.\n\"There are also other species that could potentially carry ranavirus - ornamental fish for example. So I do think there is a case to be made to investigate their role in infections.\"\nLead author Dr Stephen Price, from University College London, ZSL and Queen Mary University of London, said: \"Ranavirus is one of the most serious health threats currently facing the UK's amphibian population.\n\"So our findings that humans seem to have helped move the virus around, facilitating its rapid spread, could be translated into some straightforward ways to manage the risk of disease outbreaks.\"\nHe added: \"We certainly don't want to discourage people from adding ponds to their urban gardens - this remains one of the most positive steps we can all take to support wildlife.\n\"But equally we would strongly urge people to try to limit how much potentially-infectious material they're moving into and out of their gardens in the process.\"\nFollow Rebecca on Twitter: @BBCMorelle\nWhat is a summary of this text?"

Gather the necessary materials, including:\n      - Jolly Rancher candies (choose your preferred flavors)\n      - A cutting board or sturdy surface\n      - A resealable plastic bag or parchment paper\n      - A rolling pin, hammer, or mallet\n      - A bowl or container for collecting the crushed Jolly Ranchers\n   b. Clean your working surface and tools using warm soapy water, and then dry them thoroughly.\n   c. Before working on the candies, make sure your hands are clean and dry to avoid any contamination and stickiness.\n\n2. Pre-crushing steps:\n   a. Unwrap the Jolly Rancher candies and discard the wrappers.\n   b. Place a few candies on the cutting board or working surface.\n   c. Using a hammer, mallet, or the flat side of a large knife, gently tap the candies once or twice just to create a slight crack in them. This pre-crushing step can make it easier to break the candies into finer pieces later.\n\n3. Crushing the candies:\n   a. Place the cracked Jolly Ranchers into the resealable plastic bag, releasing any air before sealing the bag. Alternatively, you can place the candies between two sheets of parchment paper.\n   b. Lay the bag or parchment paper flat on the cutting board or sturdy surface.\n   c. Start crushing the candies by rolling the rolling pin over the bag or parchment paper. Apply firm and even pressure, moving in different directions to ensure that all candies are evenly crushed. If you don't have a rolling pin, you can use a heavy object like a hammer or mallet. However, be careful not to hit too hard, as you may puncture the bag or paper.\n   d. Periodically, pause to check the progress by gently rubbing the bag or parchment paper and feeling for any large pieces. Continue crushing until you've achieved the desired size of tiny pieces.\n\n4. Collecting and storing the crushed Jolly Ranchers:\n   a. Carefully open the plastic bag or unfold the parchment paper.\n   b. You may notice different sizes of crushed pieces, ranging from fine powder to small chunks, all of which can be used, depending on your preference and purpose.\n   c. Using a clean and dry spoon, scoop the crushed Jolly Ranchers into your chosen bowl or container.\n   d. If you won't be using the crushed candies right away, store them in an airtight container to keep them from absorbing moisture or getting clumped together. You can also store the crushed candies in the resealable bag, provided there are no puncture holes in it.\n\nNow, you've successfully crushed Jolly Ranchers into tiny pieces! These crushed candies can be used as toppings for desserts, mixed into cookie dough or cake batter, or incorporated into various arts and crafts projects. Enjoy finding creative ways to use your crushed Jolly Ranchers!"

Born on November 24, 1979, Mercedes rose to fame as a child actress, starring in several films and television shows during the early-90s.\n\nAddams Family Values is a dark comedy directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and is a sequel to the 1991 hit film \"The Addams Family.\" The distinguished Addams Family characters were initially created by Charles Addams, a renowned cartoonist from the United States, featured in The New Yorker magazine. The eccentric and macabre family went on to inspire a television series, animated series, and several movies.\n\nIn \"Addams Family Values,\" Amanda Buckman is a perky, bright, but somewhat cruel and snobbish camp-goer at Camp Chippewa, which the Addams siblings Wednesday (played by Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (played by Jimmy Workman) attend. The character Amanda is emblematic of everything the sinister Addams oppose, with her being an upbeat and conventional \"all-American girl.\"\n\nThroughout the movie, Amanda Buckman serves as a stark contrast to the morbid and deadpan personalities exhibited by the Addams family. One of the highlights of the film is the interaction between the two polar-opposite characters \u2013 Amanda Buckman and Wednesday Addams \u2013 in scenes where the two young girls are often at odds with each other, leading to memorable confrontations and exchanges.\n\nDespite not being an extremely well-known actress, Mercedes Kastner's portrayal of Amanda Buckman in \"Addams Family Values\" has become part of popular culture, contributing to the overall success of the sequel and leaving a lasting impression on the audiences who appreciate the dark humor style of The Addams Family universe."

        "value": "Write some highlights for the following article:\n\nBy. Thomas Durante. A Pentecostal reverend known for preaching with the help of a rattlesnake coiled around his arm lost his life when one of the creatures suddenly bit him. Mack Randall Wolford, pastor at the Full Gospel Apostolic House of the Lord Jesus in Matoaka, West Virginia, died hours after receiving the deadly bite on Sunday - the day after his 44th birthday. Wolford\u2019s father, who was also a serpent-handling pastor, died in the same way nearly 30 years ago. Scroll down to watch a video of Wolford preaching. Deadly bite: Mack Randall Wolford, pictured at a previous service, was killed hours after receiving the deadly bite on Sunday. Wolford had been bitten three times. before, but never sought medical attention, saying that a bite was a. test of his faith. It was his wish not to be taken to a hospital unless. absolutely necessary. But by the time he was taken to Bluefield Regional Medical Center, it was too late. Wolford was holding a 'homecoming' service outdoors at Panther State Forest about 70 miles away from Matoaka while handing the rattler, which is seen by. his followers as a sign of faith. The gathering was a yearly occurrence for Wolford, who joined relatives to celebrate faith and family before sitting down together for dinner during the Memorial Day weekend. He leaves behind his wife Fran and three stepchildren. The Bluefield Daily Telegraph reported that Wolford had set the serpent down during the service when it suddenly jerked forward and bit him on the thigh. Celebration: Wolford clutched the rattlers during his congrgation as a sign of faith. Serpent: Rattlesnakes are seen in Wolford's congregation as a test of faith. Wolford had reportedly owned the timber. rattlesnake, named Sheba, for several years, taking care of it in his. home and introducing it to his followers during his services. Videos posted to YouTube show the preacher dancing in previous services while holding the snake. His. unique celebrations were held regularly for his followers - who. numbered between five and 30 - most of whom were members of his family. Wolford. owned several snakes, which he cared for in his home, according to. filmmaker Kate Fowler, who was shooting a documentary about him called. With Signs Following. Ritual: Wolford danced with rattlesnakes during his outdoor services in West Virginia. In an interview with MailOnline, Ms. Fowler, who has worked on the documentary for about a year, described. Wolford as 'articulate, well-read, intelligent and charismatic.' She said that despite handling venomous snakes, he did his best to make his guests feel comfortable. Ms Fowler said: 'It was pretty scary the first time I was at a service, but I've never seen him put anyone in a bad situation.' A young resident of Matoaka, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Telegraph: 'I know [Wolford] was really bad off before he died... it was really bad. He\u2019s worshiped at that church all his life. Fearless: Wolford did his best to make guests at his services feel comfortable, even though he handled venomous snakes. 'His daddy passed away the same way, from a rattler. He knew the risks. All of us around here are that way.' Wolford was only 15 at the time of his father's death, but later took on his mantle. His devastated mother, who was present at the service when he was bitten, was always fearful for her son, but was extremely proud of his work with those who battled alcoholism and addiction, Ms Fowler said. There are dozens of species of rattlesnakes across the U.S., and they are the largest among venomous snakes. They usually only sound their noisy rattles if they feel cornered, threatened or taken by surprise. Rattlesnake bites are usually not fatal, as long as they are treated quickly. If bitten, victims are advised to remain calm, as a quickened heart rate can spread the venom throughout the body faster. Rattlesnakes love to sun themselves, and can be found near logs, boulders, or open areas, and in areas like mountains, prairies, deserts, and beaches, according to the CDC. A nursing supervisor at Bluefield Regional Medical Center\u00a0told the Charleston Daily Mail that Wolford was admitted to the facility at about 10:30pm on Sunday night. The supervisor told the paper: 'He was a snake handler. It looked like it happened maybe during church, but by the time he got here, it was a bad situation.' Ms Fowler was in the process of a final edit With Signs Following, but is still deciding how to approach Wolford's death in the documentary. Neighbours told the Daily Telegraph that Wolford, like other snake-handling preachers, was fully aware of the danger posed by the reptile. There are dozens of species of rattlesnakes, which are the largest of all venomous snakes in the U.S, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The timber rattlesnake, widely regarded as the most dangerous of the species, are common to deciduous forests as far north as Connecticut and as far south as Texas. It is unlawful to kill a timber rattlesnake, as it is an endangered species. While rattlers are behind the most common snakebite injuries in the United States, they are rarely fatal if treated quickly. Dangerous: Wolford owned a timber rattlesnake, similar to the one shown here. Watch videos here."

Identify common stigmas associated with GT classes.\n3. Analyze if the two questions you asked are paraphrases of each other.\n\nStep 1: Research the differences between Subaru Legacy GT and Super GT\n\nThe Subaru Legacy GT is a specific model of the Subaru Legacy, which is a midsize car produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Subaru. The Legacy GT is a sporty version with a turbocharged engine and upgraded suspension, making it more performance-oriented than the standard Legacy.\n\nThe Super GT, on the other hand, is not a specific car model but rather a racing championship series in Japan. It features a range of vehicles from various manufacturers, including Subaru, which are modified to compete in this top-level racing series. The cars in Super GT are typically more powerful and significantly modified for racing purposes compared to their road-going counterparts.\n\nStep 2: Identify common stigmas associated with GT classes\n\nHere are some common stigmas associated with GT classes:\n\n1. Expensive: Many people believe that GT class cars are always costly because they feature high-performance engines, upgraded suspension, and other performance-related enhancements.\n\n2. Unpractical for daily use: GT class cars are often viewed as impractical for everyday driving due to their performance-oriented nature. They may have stiffer suspensions, which can make them less comfortable on regular roads.\n\n3. Fuel efficiency: GT class cars may be perceived as fuel guzzlers because they typically have powerful engines built for performance, which could lead to increased fuel consumption.\n\n4. Exclusivity: Some people see GT class cars as exclusive or elitist, as they are often priced beyond the reach of many consumers and associated with prestige or luxury.\n\nStep 3: Analyze if the two questions you asked are paraphrases of each other\n\nThe two questions are:\n\n1. How do the Subaru Legacy GT and Super GT differ?\n2. What are some stigmas associated with GT classes?\n\nAfter analyzing these questions, I can see that they are not paraphrases of each other. The first question seeks to find the differences between a specific Subaru model and a racing series, while the second question explores the common stigmas associated with GT classes of cars in general. These questions address different aspects of GT classes and are not rephrased versions of the same question."

Shawn apologized and clarified that he sent out the cards but has been so busy that he hasn't had the chance to personally call anyone and invite them. He offered to send Katie a picture of the card until she can receive the physical card.\n\nThe conversation then shifted to Katie graciously accepting the invitation and assuring Shawn that she will attend the wedding.

I don't need to go to the bathroom, but it will give my rear end a break. What if everyone stares at me? Oh no, now my toes are going numb! These thoughts flew through my head during my second spin class a few weeks ago. Recently, our Fit Nation workouts have picked up in intensity. I have tried new activities and pushed myself beyond my physical comfort zone. When this journey began, I envisioned the biggest obstacle to my success would be physical. But after seven weeks of training, I have become acutely aware of the body part that needs the most conditioning. And much to my surprise, it's not my abs, triceps or quads. It's my mind. I've come to the conclusion that wanting to stop mid-workout has little to do with my body and everything to do with my mind. I know many folks who experience negative self-talk, where that little voice in your head tells you all the reasons you can't do something. My internal dialogue seems to be less focused on telling myself I can't do it and more concerned with developing and executing a workout exit strategy. My brain doesn't say, \"You can't.\" It says, \"You shouldn't.\" Oh, but I should. And I am. Change your mind, and your body will follow suit. But how do you change your mind? That's the million-dollar question. T-shirt tales: The athlete I used to be. It turns out some cliches are true. The first step is admitting you have a problem. Hi, my name is Tabitha, and I can talk myself out of a workout before I start. I had a long day at work. It's raining. I need to put gas in my car. It's Monday. Venus is in retrograde. You get the idea. Excuses and justifications are the path of least resistance. Here are some other cliches that have proved true during my training:. Listen to your body, not your head. I've been in the middle of many workouts when I desperately wanted to stop. But when I focused on what I was doing, I could ask myself, \"Do I want to stop because I am in pain? Or am I just uncomfortable because I'm sweating, breathing hard and making my body stronger?\" If I am honest with myself, the answer every time has been \"I'm just uncomfortable.\" And guess what? I have finished every workout I have started. Get fit and others will follow. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. I recently read the amazing book \"Finding Ultra\" by Rich Roll. In it he writes, \"There's only one cure for fear. Faith.\" That line resonated with me. It helped me understand that as an adult, fear has prevented me from realizing my full physical potential. In the past, fear is what has stopped me from even trying. So now, if I find myself dragging my heels about a workout, I try to identify the why. Usually, it's something silly such as fearing the embarrassment of sharing a lap lane and slowing down another swimmer. Now when I go to pool and find myself in this situation, I simply watch the swimmers for a few minutes. I try to identify someone close to my speed and skill level. I then ask if I can share the lane and tell him or her upfront that I am new to training. This has worked every single time. The real key to overcoming these fears, as Roll pointed out, is faith. Have faith in your journey, in the universe and in yourself. Why being part of a team matters. A picture is worth a thousand words. Everyone, even the toughest endurance athletes, occasionally struggle during workouts. Sometimes the only way I get through particularly tough workouts is visualization. At times, it's remembering the two years I spent in nearly constant pain as I battled ulcerative colitis. Compared with that, the aches and weariness of triathlon training pale. More often, I like to visualize my eventual triathlon success. I envision myself crossing the finish line on a warm, breezy day in Malibu, California, this September. I see myself running into the arms of my husband, daughter, parents and sisters. I imagine that magical mixture of physical exhaustion, elation, pride and disbelief that I actually did it. And it keeps me going. Oh, and that spin class? I did not stop. I finished the class without stopping. And then I ran for 20 minutes afterward.

With the loss Carolina failed to clinch the NFC South. The Giants had already clinched a first round bye by virtue of Minnesota's loss to Atlanta earlier in the day. New York won the toss and scored on their opening drive on a 32-yard John Carney field goal. Carolina responded by scoring a touchdown on their first drive, a thirteen-yard run by DeAngelo Williams. The Giants scored on their second drive as well, going 74 yards in 13 plays and ending with a Brandon Jacobs touchdown from the Carolina 2. The Panthers responded with another Williams touchdown run, this time five yards, and a 14-10 lead. After forcing the Giants to punt Carolina scored again, as Williams scored his third touchdown of the game on a one-yard run. The drive went four plays for 65 yards, 60 of which came on a deep pass from Jake Delhomme to Muhsin Muhammad. Williams' touchdown came two plays after Steve Smith appeared to have scored on a short pass, but a replay challenge was upheld. After the teams traded punts the Giants scored with 0:55 remaining in the half as Carney added his second field goal of the game. Then on their second drive of the second half, Eli Manning threw a short touchdown to Kevin Boss to cut the deficit to 21-20 with 1:07 remaining in the third quarter. Carolina scored on their very next drive, with Williams scoring for the fourth time on a thirty-yard run. New York tied the game with 3:24 remaining as Jacobs scored on a one-yard touchdown run, after starting the drive in Panther territory. The Giants converted the two-point conversion on a pass from Manning to Domenik Hixon. Carolina then drove down the field and faced fourth and five from the Giants 32-yard line, but John Kasay missed the potential game-winning field goal from 50 yards out. On their second possession of the overtime period the Giants started at their own 13-yard line. On the first play of the drive Derrick Ward ran for 51 yards and pushed the ball into Carolina territory. Ward added a fourteen-yard run two plays later and a seventeen-yard run the play following that, pushing his rushing total to 215 yards (a career-high) and leaving the Giants two yards from the endzone. On the next play Jacobs scored on a run, his third score of the game, and New York won the game. The Giants rushed for 301 yards in the game compared to 158 for the Panthers. Jacobs added 87 yards to Ward's 215. Williams rushed for 108 yards on 24 carries, including his four touchdowns. Delhomme finished 11-19 for 185 yards and Manning 17-27 for 181 and a touchdown. Ward's 14.3-yard rushing average was a single game Giants record. Manning became the first Giants quarterback to throw at least 3,000 passing yards in a season for four consecutive seasons.\n\nQuestion: Which players had 1-yard touchdown runs?"

Ironically this literature-inspired building can itself most easily be found in book form. Reading this book I remembered Goethe's quote about frozen music. Did Terragni try to freeze Dante's medieval miracle of song? Certainly a cold-poem seems artistically repulsive. Unflattering comparisons to the lake of Cocytus spring to mind too. While I cannot read Italian, I can read some German. After locating the original quotation I discovered that 'frozen' is a problematic (though common) translation of Goethe's original 'erstarrte.' The verb 'erstarren' more properly means 'to solidify' or 'to stiffen.' This suggests a chemical reaction in which the art does not necessarily chill in the transformation. Nor can simple thawing yield the original work. Like a chemical reaction it requires an artistic catalyst, a muse. Indeed the Danteum is not a physical translation of the Poem. Terragni thought it inappropriate to translate the Comedy literally into a non-literary work. The Danteum would not be a stage set, rather Terragni generated his design from the Comedy's structure, not its finishes. \n\nChoose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \"A stage design\" correctly answer the question \"What did Teragni translate the Comedy into?\"?\n\n 1. no. 2. yes."

Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118 and ruled until 1143. John was a pious and dedicated Emperor who was determined to undo the damage to the empire suffered at the Battle of Manzikert, half a century earlier. Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler at a time when cruelty was the norm. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. During his twenty-five-year reign, John made alliances with the Holy Roman Empire in the West and decisively defeated the Pechenegs at the Battle of Beroia. He thwarted Hungarian and Serbian threats during the 1120s, and in 1130 he allied himself with the German emperor Lothair III against the Norman king Roger II of Sicily.In the later part of his reign, John focused his activities on the East, personally leading numerous campaigns against the Turks in Asia Minor. His campaigns fundamentally altered the balance of power in the East, forcing the Turks onto the defensive, while restoring many towns, fortresses, and cities across the peninsula to the Byzantines. He defeated the Danishmend Emirate of Melitene and reconquered all of Cilicia, while forcing Raymond of Poitiers, Prince of Antioch, to recognise Byzantine suzerainty. In an effort to demonstrate the Emperor's role as the leader of the Christian world, John marched into the Holy Land at the head of the combined forces of the Empire and the Crusader states; yet despite his great vigour pressing the campaign, his hopes were disappointed by the treachery of his Crusader allies. In 1142, John returned to press his claims to Antioch, but he died in the spring of 1143 following a hunting accident."

Another result of the war was a large number of internally displaced persons. This especially affected the southern Shia community, as Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon in 1978, 1982 and 1996 prompted waves of mass emigration, in addition to the continual strain of occupation and fighting between Israel and Hezbollah . Many Shias from Southern Lebanon resettled in the suburbs south of Beirut. After the war, the pace of Christian emigration accelerated, as many Christians felt discriminated against in a Lebanon under increasingly oppressive Syrian occupation. According to a UNDP study, as much as 10% of the Lebanese had a disability in 1990. Other studies have pointed to the fact that this portion of society is highly marginalized due to the lack of educational and governmental support of their advancement.\n\nHow many times did Israel invade southern Lebanon?"

        "value": "The honest real estate agent refused to deceive a client. Real estate agents play a crucial role in helping clients find and purchase properties that meet their needs, and a good agent always puts the client's interests first. While there are undoubtedly dishonest real estate agents out there, an honest and professional one will refuse to deceive clients in any way.\n\nOptions like lying, manipulating, and hiding information from the client could also be applicable as dishonest acts, but deceiving encompasses all of these actions and best suits the question. An honest agent would never compromise their own integrity or the trust of their clients by providing misleading information, omitting critical details, or manipulating situations to their advantage.\n\nPerforming deceptive acts can lead to serious consequences, both for the agent and their clients. An agent caught in dishonest practices could face disciplinary actions, the loss of their professional license, or even legal consequences. Furthermore, clients who have been the victim of deception can suffer financial losses, emotional distress, and potentially face difficulties in securing a property they need or want.\n\nAdditionally, being charming is not a form of dishonesty in and of itself. While it could be used to mask intentions or manipulate others, charm alone does not equate deception. An honest agent who is also charming can utilize their charisma to build natural rapport and trust with clients and genuinely help them find the right property.\n\nIn conclusion, an honest real estate agent refuses to deceive clients, as it goes against their commitment to integrity, professionalism, and the best interests of their clients. Deception encompasses acts like lying, manipulating, and hiding information, which an honest agent would never resort to. The most suitable answer to the question is, thus, deceiving."

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\"\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. \ud83d\ude42 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... Who did the author meet at the talk he gave at a Linux Group? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Scott Thompon - co-founder of AngelList - Paul Cooper - not enough information"

But Andersen, a 46-year-old father of four, wasn't expecting any trouble on the road last New Year's Eve, when he set off for a ski trip to the Bear River Mountains with nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya. Andersen had driven through the Canyon hundreds of times over the years. The weather was fine-but the higher they drove, the more slippery the roads became. Rounding a sharp U-turn at mile marker473, Andersen saw a truck that had skated off the road and immediately tapped his brakes. In an instant, the car was sliding at 25 miles per hour toward the shoulder of the highway, then rolling down a steep ten-foot dam toward the extremely cold Logan River. As it hit the water, the car tipped toward the passenger side, hesitated, and then rolled onto its roof and sank into the river. There was no time to tell the kids what to do. The crash had broken a few windows, and within seconds, the upside-down car was filled with water. \"It was frightening how fast we were completely underwater,\"remembers Andersen, a soft-spoken product development manager.\"You're thinking, is this how it's all going to end?\" Having lost all sense of direction, Andersen began to search the freezing water for the kids. Mia had been right next to him in the front seat; now, in the blackness, he couldn't find her.\"I thought, if I don't get out, maybe none of us are going to get out.\" Andersen got out of his seat belt, swam through a broken window, and, deeply and quickly, breathed air at the surface. That's when he saw a group of men, about ten in all, appear at the top of the dam. One after another, they raced down into the water. Helping onto safety all the three children, they began to shout at the father,\"Who else is in the car?\"Andersen says respectfully,\" _  .\" Question: Which of the following can be the best title of the text?

The object of Dark's affections, Mel (Rachel True), a bisexual African-American girl from where he goes to school, feels for him deeply but can't commit herself to any one person or gender, splitting her time between Dark and her curvaceous, purple-haired, acid-tonged, lesbian girlfriend Lucifer (Kathleen Robertson). Dark, meanwhile, becomes enthralled by the beauteous Montgomery (Nathan Bexton), a young, blond, homosexual with two different color eyes from his school who's literally \"a vision to behold the golden California sun.\"On this typical Friday morning, Dark, Mel and Lucifer drive in Mel's car to The Hole, their local coffeehouse hangout for breafast. They pick up Montgomery, who's standing lonely at a bus stop also looking for a ride there. At the Hole, Dark meets and commiserates with his best friend, queer industrial rock star Cowboy (Guillermo Diaz) who has troubles of his own: he can't find his boyfriend and band mate, Bart (Jeremy Jordan), who's on a self-destructive downward spiral that threatens both their romantic and musical partnership. Bart, at that very moment, is at the home of the scurvy, green-haired, drug dealer Handjob (Alan Boyce). Bart is far more interested in Handjob's wares than in the perversion of being offered by the dangerously sexy dominatrix duo of Kriss (Chiara Mastroianni) and Kozy (Debi Mazar), Handjob's live-in S&M; girls.Also convening at The Hole for a \"sugar gorge\" are a trio of girls from where the gang also goes to school.

Gaining insights into these bodily functions can provide a deeper understanding of our overall health and well-being. One such lesser-known test to gauge a hidden aspect of your health is the \"wrist lick test\" coupled with swabbing the back of your tongue. This simple self-assessment can reveal some interesting information about your personal hygiene.\n\nThe Wrist Lick Test\n\nStep-by-step, here\u2019s how to perform this easy test:\n\n1. Lick the inside of your wrist: Use your own saliva to moisten a small area on the inside of your wrist. This part of your arm is commonly used for self-assessment because it is easily accessible and has a uniform skin surface that prevents interference from sweat or other chemicals.\n\n2. Allow the saliva to dry: Give the saliva a few seconds to dry and evaporate. As saliva mostly consists of water, this step is essential to provide accurate results. In the process of evaporation, volatile compounds present in the saliva are better detected since they dissipate less in air than in a liquid medium.\n\n3. Smell the inside of your wrist: After the saliva has dried, bring your wrist close to your nose and take a whiff. By doing this, you will be able to get a clear idea of how your breath smells. Often, bad breath can go unnoticed, as our nose tends to filter out our own odors. This can result in an unawareness of potential bad breath that others around us may notice.\n\nSwabbing the Back of Your Tongue\n\nWhile the wrist lick test helps you understand the smell of your breath, swabbing the back of your tongue provides valuable information on the state of your oral hygiene. To perform a tongue swab:\n\n1. Use a clean finger, spoon, or tongue scraper: Before performing this step, ensure your hands and utensils are clean to prevent introducing any external germs or bacteria into your mouth.\n\n2. Gently swab the back of your tongue: Using your chosen tool, carefully swab the back of your tongue \u2013 where most odor-causing bacteria reside. By swabbing the back of your tongue, you can get a glimpse of the current state of your oral hygiene. If there is a white, gray, or yellow coating, this could indicate poor oral hygiene and the presence of bacteria.\n\n3. Evaluate and maintain good oral hygiene: If you notice a strong smell from your tongue swab or wrist lick test, consider re-evaluating your oral health routine. Implementing practices such as regular brushing, flossing, and tongue scraping \u2013 coupled with frequent dentist visits \u2013 can help maintain optimal oral health.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe wrist lick test and back of the tongue swab are simple yet effective methods of self-assessing your personal hygiene. By regularly performing these tests, you can actively monitor your oral health and take measures to enhance your overall well-being. Don't be surprised by issues such as bad breath or poor oral health. Take charge and maintain a healthy lifestyle \u2013 starting from the inside out."

According to Patricia, the incident had left them feeling vulnerable and anxious, gravely impacting their mental health and well-being.\n\nIn response to Patricia's statement, the media coverage quickly gained momentum. Articles and news broadcasts began to share the story, seeking to provide information to the public about the alleged assault. With the growing interest in this case, scrutiny fell on both Patricia and Amy, with their actions and statements being scrutinized by journalists and the public alike.\n\nOption 1: Patricia receives a lot of sympathy from the media\n\nAs Patricia shared their experiences with the world, many within the media expressed their sympathy and understanding. News reports and articles discussed Patricia's pain and the impact on their life, calling for justice to be served. Social media, too, became a platform for Patricia's supporters to rally behind them, using hashtags and creating online campaigns to show solidarity and demand accountability from Amy. \n\nOpinion pieces explored the issues of violence and assault, and the role of power dynamics in these situations, with many journalists taking Patricia's side. The public's empathy grew as Patricia's story resonated with the experiences of many people who had faced similar hardships. The emotional response from the media further amplified Patricia's voice, transforming them into a symbol of strength and resilience.\n\nOption 2: Amy receives a lot of sympathy from the media\n\nHowever, not everyone was quick to believe Patricia's claims. Many within the media started questioning the validity of the accusations, demanding evidence to substantiate the allegations. As the case unfolded, sympathies began to shift towards Amy, with journalists and commentators suggesting that they may be innocent, and that Patricia's public statement could be a means to tarnish Amy's reputation.\n\nAmy, feeling wrongfully accused, decided to share their side of the story, asserting that the events described by Patricia had never occurred. This, too, became a widely-discussed topic across media outlets, sparking debates about the pitfalls of trial by public opinion. Instances of false accusations and their consequences on the accused's lives were explored in-depth in various analyses, urging the public to remain cautious in making judgments.\n\nThe intense media scrutiny took its toll on both Amy and Patricia, as both parties found their lives under constant examination. However, despite the shifting sympathies of the media, it became clear that in a case like this, the undeniable fact remains that the testimonies of both parties need thorough and impartial investigation before a fair conclusion can be reached. As the focus on this case continued to grow, it served as a stark reminder of the importance of exercising caution in the court of public opinion and the need for proper legal channels when dealing with sensitive matters like assault allegations."

Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) ripped his colleagues during a tour of northeast Oklahoma, calling them \u201ccareer elitists,\u201d \u201ccowards\u201d and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a good thing I can\u2019t pack a gun on the Senate floor.\u201d \n  \n Coburn\u2019s gun-on-the-floor comment comes less than a month after Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) made a triumphant return to the Capitol and the House floor following an assassination attempt in January outside a Tucson supermarket. \n  \n Text Size - \n  \n + \n  \n reset POLITICO 44 \n  \n At the time of the shooting, in which six people were killed, there were calls for re-instituting the federal ban on high-capacity ammunition clips and beefing up protection for members of Congress. None of the proposals gained significant traction since. \n  \n Coburn spokesman John Hart sought to walk back the comments. \n  \n \u201cDr. Coburn was obviously joking and would be happy to personally apologize to any of his colleagues who were offended,\u201d Hart told CBS NEWS. \u201cThat said, his frustration with a Congress that has inflicted severe economic damage on the country is well-known and well-founded. Fortunately, actions speak louder than words. Few have done more to try to bridge the divide in Congress and come up with a solution than Dr. Coburn.\u201d \n  \n Hart declined to speak with POLITICO. \n  \n Coburn\u2019s remarks on Wednesday, reported by the Tulsa World, represent a tour de force of conservative thought. He said the nation\u2019s health care system was better before Medicare existed, even as he noted that some people received poor care at the time and doctors often accepted baked goods or chickens in partial payment. \n  \n \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me the system is better now than it was before Medicare,\u201d he said. \n  \n He told a group at the Integris Mayes County Medical Center in Pryor, Okla.: \u201cShow me where in the Constitution the federal government is responsible for your health care?\u201d \n  \n Without specifying what he meant, Coburn said President Barack Obama has an \u201cintent is to create dependency because it worked so well for him.\u201d \n  \n The World\u2019s caption below a photo of Coburn reads the understated: \u201cDisagrees with Obama\u2019s politics.\u201d \n  \n \u201cAs an African-American male,\u201d Coburn said, Obama received \u201ctremendous advantage from a lot of these programs.\u201d The programs were not identified in the World report. \n  \n Coburn, a friend of Obama\u2019s from their shared time in the Senate, added that Congress is to blame for most of the nation\u2019s problems. \n  \n \u201cI don\u2019t think presidents matter that much,\u201d he said. \n  \n The chickens remark harkens to the 2010 Nevada GOP Senate primary, when then-front-runner Sue Lowden proposed paying a health care barter system that would include paying physicians with chickens. Lowden lost the primary to Sharron Angle, who then lost the general election to Sen. Harry Reid. ||||| A story just moved in the Tulsa World that has the Senator saying some odd things about Medicare and then some kinda unfortunate things about President Obama. \n  \n First, back to the future with Chicken Care \u2026 \n  \n \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me the system is better now than it was before Medicare,\u201d he said. Coburn agreed that some people received poor care - or no care - before Medicare was enacted in the 1960s, but said communities worked together to make sure most people received needed medical attention. He also conceded that doctors and hospitals often went unpaid for their efforts, or accepted baked goods or chickens in partial payment. \n  \n Coburn then rejected one townhall attendee\u2019s suggestion that President Obama wanted to destroy America but suggested that he wanted to create a culture of dependency because dependency worked out so well for him. \n  \n Responding to a man in Langley who asked if Obama \u201cwants to destroy America,\u201d Coburn said the president is \u201cvery bright\u201d and loves his country but has a political philosophy that is \u201cgoofy and wrong.\u201d Obama\u2019s \u201cintent is not to destroy, his intent is to create dependency because it worked so well for him,\u201d he said. \u201cAs an African-American male,\u201d Coburn said, Obama received \u201ctremendous advantage from a lot of these programs.\u201d \n  \n  ||||| Sen. Coburn: It's a 'good thing I can't pack a gun on the Senate floor' \n  \n By Josiah Ryan - \n  \n Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) criticized his congressional colleagues Tuesday, calling them \"cowards\" and a \"class of career elitists.\" \n  \n  \n  \n \"It's just a good thing I can't pack a gun on the Senate floor,\" Coburn told a crowd in Langley, Okla., as reported in Wednesday's Tulsa World. \n  \n The two-term senator, who has earned the nickname \"Dr. No\" for his frequent holds on legislation, has never been one to mince words. But his comments about carrying a gun come after the January assignation attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who returned to Congress for the first time a few weeks ago in order to vote on a deal to raise the debt ceiling. \n  \n He did add that most members of Congress are good people with good intentions, according to the Tulsa World report. \n  \n Coburn recently reaffirmed his pledge to only serve two terms, saying he would retire when his term is up in 2016. \n  \n  \n  \n Despite their political differences, the conservative senator is good friends with President Obama, whom he defended during one exchange with voters back in Oklahoma. \n  \n  \n  \n He said the president's \"intent is not to destroy\" but to create a dependency on the government, in part because of his experience growing up as a minority in America. \n  \n \"His intent is to create dependency because it worked so well for him,\u201d he said. \n  \n  \n  \n \"As an African-American male,\" Coburn said, Obama received \"tremendous advantage from a lot of these programs.\" \n  \n  \n  \n He also joined Obama in blaming the country's problems on Congress, adding that \"I don't think presidents matter that much.\" \n  \n  \n  \n The senator, a member of the bipartisan \"Gang of Six,\", said he hopes the new supercommittee created to cut government spending will be successful, but added that he's not optimistic. He also predicted lawmakers would back away from the spending controls rather than agree to spending cuts. \n  \n  \n  \n \"The cowards in Washington won't even put that through,\" he said. \n  \n  |||||"

After the performance, Novak is mobbed by well-wishers, and a student reporter questions him about his favorite composers. Novak lists some famous ones, then adds, \"And, of course, Hollenius.\" Novak returns to his dressing room, Christine enters and their eyes meet in his mirror.

Karel becomes suspicious of the rare artwork on display and the fur coat hanging in the closet. Christine has told Karel that she is living a precarious existence as a pianist but this conflicts with the evidence in the apartment. They marry, but the composer Alexander Hollenius (Claude Rains) makes a dramatic entrance at their wedding reception. It is evident he is jealous, and the stress leads him to break a wine glass without deliberate intent. Hollenius soon gives Novak a manuscript score of his new cello concerto, which Novak agrees to perform at its premiere. It becomes apparent to Christine that a cellist in the orchestra, Bertram Gribble (John Abbott), is being tutored in the solo part by Hollenius. Suspecting the sabotage of her husband's career, she unsuccessfully attempts to bribe Gribble into not co-operating. A friction develops between Novak and Hollenius, and the composer angrily breaks off a dress rehearsal on the grounds of Novak's temperamental behavior. On the evening of the premiere, Christine visits Hollenius, who threatens to tell Novak of their love affair. Distraught, Christine shoots him dead. Another conductor, Neilsen, takes the place of the absent Hollenius, and the performance is a great success. While well-wishers wait, Christine confesses everything to her husband, and they leave the concert hall..."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "The most appropriate answer is \"road\" because the primary purpose of a car is transportation, and roads are the main infrastructure designed for vehicular travel. While the other choices can be related to cars, their connection is not as direct or representative of a car's primary function. Here's an explanation for each choice:\n\n1. Air port - Although cars can be driven to airports and even be rented or picked up there, automobile usage isn't specific to airports. Cars don't belong to airports since these places are primarily designed for air travel.\n\n2. Repair shop - Cars might occasionally need repair or maintenance; however, they don't inherently belong to repair shops. These places are not where cars are designed for use, but rather where they are taken when necessary.\n\n3. Road - Cars belong on roads as this is where they're primarily used and intended for travel. Roads are specifically designed for a wide variety of vehicles, including cars, and are used by most drivers for their daily transportation needs. This makes \"road\" the most accurate choice.\n\n4. Race track - While cars can be driven on race tracks for sporting events or leisure, these tracks are specifically designed for racing. Not all cars are race cars, and most are used for day-to-day transportation on public roads, not high-speed racing on tracks. This option is more specific and niche compared to \"road.\"\n\n5. Freeway - Even though freeways are a type of road, they are generally intended for high-speed long-distance travel. Not all cars travel on freeways and, as a category, roads encompass a better representation of where most cars are driven.\n\nIn conclusion, \"road\" best represents where a car belongs due to its primary purpose of transportation and the general use of roads for vehicular travel."

In this case, we must evaluate whether the specific characteristics outlined in the premise apply to the broader statement:\n\n1. The number of women: Both the premise and the statement involve three women.\n2. The setting: Both scenarios involve a fence that the women are leaning against.\n3. The direction they're looking: If the concert is to the left of the women, then the premise aligns with the statement.\n\nHowever, there are some details in the premise that are not specified in the statement, such as the women's hair color, the color of their skirts, and a more precise description of the fence. Therefore, in this case, it is possible that the premise is true if the given information about the three women in the statement matches the description in the premise.\n\nOn the other hand, let's consider the possibility that the premise is not true for the statement. There are certain aspects that can create discrepancies between the premise and the statement:\n\n1. Hair color: The statement makes no mention of hair color, so there is no guarantee that the three women in the statement have brown hair like in the premise.\n2. Clothing: The statement does not specify the outfits worn by the women, so their skirts may or may not be brown and green as described in the premise. Additionally, the women in the statement could be wearing pants or other clothing items instead of skirts.\n3. Direction they're looking: The statement only mentions that the women are watching the concert rather than specifying the direction they're looking. It's uncertain whether the concert is situated to their left as mentioned in the premise.\n\nBased on these two angles, it is inconclusive whether the premise is true or false. It can only be determined with certainty if the additional information aligns with the description provided in the premise. The premise could be considered true if it is confirmed that all the details in the premise apply to the three women watching the concert in the statement. Conversely, if the additional details do not match, the premise would be considered false."

On a rainy, windy night, Seattle started off strong with RB Shaun Alexander getting a three-yard TD run for the only score of the first quarter. The 49ers offense was almost nonexistent in the first half, as seven of San Francisco's first eight drives ended in three-and-outs. However, the Seahawks still allowed a 39-yard field goal by Niners kicker Joe Nedney near the end of the half. After a scoreless third quarter, Seattle's defense started giving way.  49ers QB Alex Smith completed an 8-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis. An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Davis combined with an excellent kickoff return by Nate Burleson gave Seattle prime field position at the San Francisco 33-yard line. However, the Seahawks failed to convert on a fourth down play on the first series from scrimmage, and turned the ball over on downs. Smith would take advantage by driving his team downfield and completing a 20-yard TD pass to RB Frank Gore. San Francisco delivered the final blow with Smith running for an 18-yard TD on a naked bootleg with no defenders near him. The Seahawks got a 22-yard touchdown from QB Matt Hasselbeck to TE Jerramy Stevens with under two minutes left, but it wouldn't be enough as Seattle would get swept by the 49ers. With the loss, the Seahawks fell to 8-6.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question. How many field goals did Joe Nedney kick in the second quarter?"

The population is up, but the number of households that own a car and the number of licensed drivers are not. More people are using public transit, rental cars and bicycles to get around town.\n\nBut that\u2019s not unique to Washington, nor is it the primary reason that the region saw a decline in congestion.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when D.C. shuts down for a month and government hiring slows with sequester,\u201d said Jim Bak of Inrix.\n\nFurloughs and the government shutdown last year put fewer drivers into the daily commute, he said.\n\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the shutdown, D.C. would have been flat or up slightly,\u201d Bak said. \u201cBlame it on Congress. That\u2019s kind of a popular thing to do these days, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nWashington wasn\u2019t alone in seeing a drop in congestion. So did Youngstown, Akron and Toledo in Ohio, Scranton and Allentown in Pennsylvania, and several other cities.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the cities with drops, they were the Rust Belt cities that never got [their economy] going last year,\u201d Bak said.\n\nIn all, 61 metropolitan areas in the United States saw traffic increase last year. Several of those cities \u2014 Austin, San Jose, Seattle and Boston \u2014 saw a corresponding growth in population as people were attracted by job availability and the desire to live in an urban core.\n\n\u201cPeople are moving where the jobs are, and that\u2019s major urban cities,\u201d Bak said. \u201cYoung people who are coming out of college want to live in urban centers, not in the suburbs.\u201d\n\nAs that trend toward renewed urbanization continues, he said, the United States may struggle with more congestion. While the average driver in Washington loses 40 hours a year stuck in traffic, he said there are those who waste \u201cway, way more than that.\u201d\n\nWith 70 percent of the world\u2019s population forecast to be clustered around urban hubs by mid-century, he said commutes like the two to three hours drivers invest in San Paolo, Brazil, and congestion like the infamous 10-day traffic tie-up caused by road construction in Beijing in 2010 should be lessons for the United States.\n\n\u201cThe solution for us isn\u2019t going to be building new roads,\u201d Bak said. \u201cOur future highways are going to be built with software and technology.\u201d\n\nGet updates on your area delivered via e-mail.\nWhat are the most important parts of this text?"

Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that \"what's happening in Europe \u2026 we can't allow that to happen to the United States \u2014 not on my watch.\" Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years. Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's \"zero-tolerance\" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border. Nielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law. \"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\" she said. Asked about critics accusing the administration of using children as \"pawns\" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, \"I say that is a very cowardly response,\" adding it is clearly within Congress' power \"to make the laws and change the laws. They should do so.\" Trump's Republican party controls both chambers in Congress, and the family border policies were set by his administration.

        "value": "Yes, the statement you found on Google is correct. However, I would like to provide more detailed information to help you better understand Polyester in packaging PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate).\n\nPolyester is a broad term that comprises a large family of polymers with a similar structure. In the context of packaging, the term \"Polyester\" typically refers to polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is a popular thermoplastic polymer resin. PET is known for its versatility and is used in various applications due to its lightweight, strength, transparency, and resistance to moisture and gases.\n\nAs the Google search result mentions, approximately 60% of the PET production worldwide is for synthetic fibers, and around 30% is for bottle production. This leaves a smaller percentage for other applications, such as packaging materials, engineering resins, and films.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of PET's uses:\n\n1. Synthetic fibers: PET is widely used in the textile industry for producing synthetic fibers like polyester. This material has desirable properties such as wrinkle resistance, quick-drying ability, and low moisture absorbency, which makes it ideal for apparel, home furnishings, automotive interiors, and industrial applications.\n\n2. Bottle production: PET's properties make it suitable for producing rigid containers, especially bottles. The 30% PET production share for bottles consists mostly of single-use containers for food and beverages, such as water, soda, juice, and condiments. PET bottles are lightweight, shatter-resistant, and provide an effective barrier for gases and moisture, ensuring the contents' freshness and quality.\n\n3. Food packaging materials: PET is also used in food packaging materials like trays, clamshell containers, and film wraps. Its protective features make it a suitable option for fresh produce, pre-packaged meals, and baked goods. Furthermore, PET is an FDA-approved material for food contact applications, ensuring its safety in food packaging.\n\n4. Engineering resins: PET's high strength, dimensional stability, and resistance to wear make it an attractive material for engineering applications. This includes parts for automotive applications, electrical components, and other consumer products.\n\n5. Films and sheets: Transparent or semi-transparent PET films and sheets are also produced for various purposes, such as flexible food packaging, photographic film, and electronic components.\n\nIn summary, the information you found is accurate, but it is essential to understand that PET is a versatile material with a wide range of applications. While synthetic fibers and bottle production form the majority of its usage, PET also plays a significant role in food packaging materials, engineering resins, and films for diverse industries."

The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \"tragic\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's..."

The best women need 4.5 minutes .Women's times are always slower than men's ,but some facts are a surprise. Some of the fastest women swimmers today are teenager girls. One of them swam 400 meters in 4 minutes 21.2 seconds when she was only 16. The first \"Tarzan\" in films was an Olympic swimmer ,Johnny Weissmuller. His fastest 400 meters was 4 minutes 59.1 seconds, which is 37.9 seconds slower than a girl 50 years later ! This does not mean that women are catching men up .Conditions are very different now ,and sport is much more serious .It is so serious that some women athletes are given hormone injections. At the Olympics a doctor has to check whether the women athletes are really women or not. It seems sad that sport has such problems. Life can be very complicated when there are two separate sexes! Question: What problems does sport have? Options: A: Some women athletes are actually men. B: Some women athletes are given hormone injections. C: Women and men do not run or swim in the same races. D: It is difficult to check whether women athletes are really women."

For one tie, you'll need at least 1\u00a01\u20442 yards (1.4\u00a0m) of fabric for the front of the tie and about 5 x 6 inches of fabric for the back liner.  Silk is a popular choice for tie liners. For a casual tie, go for patterned cotton, linen or denim. Ties are made with a material called interfacing, which is sewn or ironed into the inside of the tie as a liner. It allows fabrics to keep a firm shape. You will need 1\u00a01\u20442 yards (1.4\u00a0m) of interfacing in a color that matches the tie fabric.  For fusible interfacing, you will put the glazed side face down on the tie fabric to permanently adhere it to the tie. Be sure to buy sewable, fusible interfacing because you will be sewing the tie later on.  Interfacing that is sewn-in does not have a glaze on it. It is sewn to the inside of the seam line so there won't be visible stitching on the outside of the tie. In addition to the fabric and interfacing, you will need to buy the following supplies:  Fine thread that matches the tie fabric A good pair of fabric scissors Either a needle (if you're sewing the tie by hand) or a sewing machine Straight pins Measuring tape Iron There are many tie patterns available for you to choose from. Once you find a style you like, you can print the outline for it online for free. The alternative to printing a tie outline would be to use a ruler to trace another tie out yourself.  When tie outlines print, they will continue onto more than one page because the length of the tie will be longer than a standard sheet of printing paper. Simply tape the paper together when you trace them onto the fabric. You will need about 3/8in of additional space outside of your trace line that you will later use for the inseam."

Sports\n\nThe text is discussing a situation involving Kevin Brown, who is likely a professional athlete, specifically a baseball player, since the term \"pinstripes\" typically refers to the uniforms worn by baseball players, most notably the New York Yankees. Brown is experiencing multiple health challenges in his first year, including an intestinal parasite and lower back pain. The mention of two cortisone shots also indicates that the topic pertains to sports medicine and athlete well-being.\n\nIn the context of sports, it's crucial for athletes like Brown to maintain good health in order to perform at their best. The fact that he's experiencing these difficulties in his first year suggests that this may be impacting his performance on the field. Sports fans and commentators might take an interest in this topic because it can directly affect a team's success.\n\nTo delve deeper into the topic, Kevin Brown's experience with an intestinal parasite may have impacted his physical health, energy levels, and strength, potentially resulting in missed games or reduced effectiveness on the field. Intestinal parasites are organisms that can enter the body through contaminated food or water, and they can cause various symptoms in their host, ranging from mild to severe. In Brown's case, he had to deal with the parasite for two months, possibly affecting his ability to train and compete at the highest level.\n\nAdditionally, the lower back pain that prompted two cortisone shots could also severely hinder Brown's performance. Lower back pain can be a common issue for professional athletes, particularly in sports like baseball that involve repetitive motions and stress on the spine. For a baseball player, back pain can affect the swing, pitch delivery, and general mobility on the field. Cortisone shots are often administered to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain temporarily. However, they may not address the root cause of the issue, which may require further medical intervention and rehabilitation.\n\nIn summary, this text is about sports \u2013 specifically a professional baseball player, Kevin Brown, who is experiencing significant health challenges during his first year in pinstripes. Understanding the impact of these health issues on Brown's performance is important for sports enthusiasts and analysts, as it can influence the team dynamics and overall success."

The major cause of your forgetfulness may be linked to what you store in your body, not in your short-term memory bank. Tests continue to show that people with enough Vitamin B-2 do well in memory exams. The \"B\" could stand for \"brain\", if you're one of many with limited instant recall. And the number one source of that vitamin   is sunflower seeds. Even when you're sleeping or relaxing, your brain is still at work. Although it makes up just two percent of your total body weight, it uses up to 30 % of the calories   you take in each day. For it to work properly, it must be fed. Even if you're not a breakfast eater, that meal is the best way to prepare your brain for the day. A quick and easy English _ with peanut and butter in it, a glass of milk, and an orange, might be what your brain may be asking you the first thing in the morning when you feel your head is in a fog. Having sunflower seeds and fruit between meals adds more muscle to that hungry, demanding organ. Vitamin B-1 also helps the memory, and that is found in eggs, meats and nuts. In Chinese culture, walnuts are known as the fruit for a long life because it is believed that they feed both the kidneys and the brain. And according to Chinese culture, if you keep those two important organs in good working order, you'll live longer. However forgetful you are, just keep in mind the letter \"B\", which will help you to \"bear in mind almost everything\" even on those days when life's challenges are sending you in a billion directions. What can we conclude from the passage? A) Two percent of our brain is still active when we are sleeping or relaxing. B) What we eat seems more important than what we learn in terms of memory.

The South Pole is located at Earth's southernmost point, on the continent of Antarctica. Antarctica is a frozen continent, with its ice sheet containing nearly 90% of Earth's freshwater reserves. Due to the extreme cold, water exists primarily in the solid state, as ice, and in the gas state, as water vapor.\n\nTo further clarify this point, let's examine why the other options are not correct:\n\n(a) Indian Ocean: The Indian Ocean is a vast body of water, and as with any ocean, it predominantly features water in its liquid state. Here, water can be found in all three states: solid (in the form of icebergs and frozen regions near Antarctica), liquid (the majority of the ocean), and gas (water vapor evaporating from the ocean).\n\n(b) Interior of Africa: The interior of Africa spans a wide range of climates, from the arid Sahara Desert to lush, green savannas and rainforests. In these diverse environments, water is typically found in all three states: solid (in high-altitude regions like mountain ranges), liquid (e.g., lakes, rivers, and groundwater), and gas (humidity and evaporation).\n\n(d) Tropic of Cancer: The Tropic of Cancer is the northernmost latitude where the sun can be directly overhead at its zenith. This line runs through various continents, each with distinct climate zones and water availability. As such, water is usually found naturally in all three states in different regions along the Tropic of Cancer: solid (in high-altitude regions like the Himalayas), liquid (lakes, rivers, oceans), and gas (water vapor and humidity).\n\nIn summary, the South Pole (Antarctica) is the place where water is typically found naturally in only two states, solid and gas, due to its extremely cold and inhospitable environment. In contrast, options A, B, and D involve a wider range of climate zones and geographic locations, where water can be found in all three states: solid, liquid, and gas."

He was born in Greenville, Mississippi and raised in Leland, Mississippi and Hyattsville, Maryland. Henson began developing puppets while attending high school. He created Sam and Friends while he was a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park, a five-minute sketch-comedy puppet show that appeared on television.\n\nJames Maury Henson was born in Greenville, Mississippi on September 24, 1936, the younger of two children of Paul Ransom Henson (1904-1994), an agronomist for the United States Department of Agriculture, and his wife Betty Marcella (nee Brown, 1904-1992). He was raised as a Christian Scientist and spent his early childhood in Leland, Mississippi, before moving with his family to University Park, Maryland in the late 1940s, near Washington, D.C. He remembered the arrival of the family's first television as \"the biggest event of his adolescence,\" having been heavily influenced by radio ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and the early television puppets of Burr Tillstrom on Kukla, Fran and Ollie and Bil and Cora Baird. He remained a Christian Scientist at least into his twenties when he would teach Sunday School, but he wrote to a Christian Science church in 1975 to inform them that he was no longer a practicing member.  Henson began working for WTOP-TV (now WUSA-TV) in 1954 while attending Northwestern High School, creating puppets for a Saturday morning children's show called The Junior Morning Show. He enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park as a studio arts major upon graduation, thinking that he might become a commercial artist. A puppetry class offered in the applied arts department introduced him to the craft and textiles courses in the College of Home Economics, and he graduated in 1960 with a BS in home economics. As a freshman, he had been asked to create Sam and Friends, a five-minute puppet show for WRC-TV. The characters on Sam and Friends were forerunners of the Muppets, and the show included a prototype of Henson's most famous character Kermit the Frog. He remained at WRC from 1954 to 1961.  In the show, Henson began experimenting with techniques that changed the way in which puppetry was used on television, including using the frame defined by the camera shot to allow the puppet performer to work from off-camera. He believed that television puppets needed to have \"life and sensitivity\" and began making characters from flexible, fabric-covered foam rubber, allowing them to express a wider array of emotions at a time when many puppets were made of carved wood. A marionette's arms are manipulated by strings, but Henson used rods to move his Muppets' arms, allowing greater control of expression. Additionally, he wanted the Muppet characters to \"speak\" more creatively than was possible for previous puppets, which had random mouth movements, so he used precise mouth movements to match the dialogue.  When Henson began work on Sam and Friends, he asked fellow University of Maryland sophomore Jane Nebel to assist him. The show was a financial success but, after graduating from college, he began to have doubts about going into a career performing with puppets. He spent several months in Europe, where he was inspired by European puppet performers who looked on their work as an art form. He and Jane began dating after his return to the United States. They were married in 1959 and had five children: Lisa (b. 1960), Cheryl (b. 1961), Brian (b. 1963), John (b. 1965, d. 2014), and Heather (b. 1970).\n\nWhat year was he born ?"

Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher.

I was so exhausted all the time that I didn't want to socialise, and because of my loud snoring I was too embarrassed to go and sleep at anyone else's house.\"\nSleep apnoea is the most common sleep disorder, according to the NHS. It is caused when the muscles and soft tissue in the throat relax, causing a blockage of the airways.\nThe lack of oxygen to the brain causes those with the condition to wake up or have regular interruptions to their sleep. Common symptoms include loud snoring or gasping and grunting whilst asleep.\nThose with the condition usually manage it by wearing an oxygen mask at night, or other oral devices that keep the airways open. Many are encouraged to lose weight and in some cases people can undergo surgery to remove excess tissue in their passageways.\nAnalysing data collected by NHS England, the BBC has found the number of sleeping disorder tests has increased every year over the past decade.\nNHS South Sefton in Liverpool had the highest rate of sleep diagnostic tests being commissioned last year.\nDoctors attribute the rise in the number of sleep tests to a greater sense of public awareness about the wider health implications of not getting enough sleep.\n\"Sleep apnoea is a serious condition which can lead to other problems such as high blood pressure, which in turn can lead to strokes and heart attacks,\" said Dr Stephen Bianchi from Sheffield's Northern General Hospital.\nIt is estimated that about 1.5 million people in the UK suffer from the condition, although doctors warn many people will have never been formally diagnosed.\n\"We think about 2% of females, and 4% of males in the UK have significant sleep apnoea. However, we suspect that 80% of those with the condition are unaware they have it,\" Dr Bianchi added.\nConsultants at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust have been pioneering new ways of treating a range of sleep disorders.\nPatients with sleep apnoea  are often tested for neurological sleep conditions such as insomnias and rapid eye movement (REM) disorders.\nIain Gordon, from Doncaster, has an REM behaviour disorder, which sees him physically act out his dreams when he's asleep.\n\"If I have a dream that I'm fighting crocodiles or jumping off a cliff, I will shout and kick out.\n\"But the reason why I've now sought help is because there have been instances recently where I've hit my wife whilst I've been asleep.\"\nDr Gary Dennis, from the Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, said sleep disorders could have \"wide and unpredictable\" outcomes.\nOne sleep disorder sufferer, Brian Thomas from Neath in south Wales, killed his wife during a violent nightmare and was told by a judge he \"bore no responsibility\".\n\"REM disorders are not inconsequential,\" said Dr Dennis.\n\"At one end of the spectrum I've had the spouses of my patients who have needed dental work because they've been hit by their bed partner.

These tests help find out if someone has sleep apnoea, which is when people stop breathing while they are sleeping. This is caused by the throat muscles and soft tissue relaxing and blocking the airways. A lot of people with sleep apnoea snore loudly or make gasping noises while they sleep. They usually have to wear an oxygen mask at night so they can breathe. Doctors think there are around 1.5 million people in the UK with sleep apnoea, but many of them might not know they have it."

The government reported voter turnout of 99.98 percent. \n  \n The North Korean authorities run parliamentary elections as an effective political census, a chance to check up on the whereabouts and the political allegiance of citizens, as well as the ability of local Workers\u2019 Party officials to mobilize residents. People pile into voting booths casting unmarked ballots in rapid succession. Those who oppose the state-selected candidate are supposedly allowed to pause to cross out the candidate\u2019s name, effectively making the process a monitored event, according to defectors from the North. \n  \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n  \n Some of the North Koreans who entered China and ended up defecting to South Korea after the famine in their home country in the mid-1990s have said they did so because they feared punishment back home for failing to show up for parliamentary elections. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption North Korean leader Kim Jong-un voted in Pyongyang \n  \n North Koreans have been voting in a five-yearly election to approve members of the rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly. \n  \n Each of the 687 districts had only one candidate running for office, with electors required to write only \"Yes\" or \"No\" on the ballot paper. \n  \n Campaign posters across the capital, Pyongyang, urged a \"Yes\" vote. \n  \n Observers say the candidate list is an opportunity to see who is in or out of favour with the leadership. \n  \n Analysis The North Korean vote is a ritual, the result of which has already been largely determined. The Supreme People's Assembly meets rarely and has very little power but you would not know it from the official turnout. There is only one candidate for each district, and one name on each ballot paper. The democratic duty for the electorate is simply to write \"Yes\" beside it. Writing anything else might be seen as treachery, rather than democracy. That is especially true if you live in the district of Mount Paekdu - the constituency of current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. State media have devoted entire reports to the excitement of voters at the Mount Paekdu polling station, on seeing his name on the ballot paper. The only real value in these polls, analysts say, is in watching for any signs of change in the list of state-approved candidates. \n  \n In the last election in 2009, turnout was 99%, with 100% of votes in favour of the given candidates. \n  \n The election is the first to be held under the leadership of Kim Jong-un, who came to power in December 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il. \n  \n Mr Kim was registered as a candidate in Mount Paekdu, venerated in party propaganda as the birthplace of Kim Jong-il. \n  \n The leader was shown on state media casting his ballot in Pyongyang. \n  \n The vote was held in a holiday atmosphere in the capital, Pyongyang, with performances taking place in the street. \n  \n \"Through this election we will fully display the might of the single-hearted unity of our army and people,\" said Hyon Byong-chol, chairman of a preparatory committee for one of the sub-districts in the election. \n  \n He told the Associated Press news agency that North Koreans were \"firmly united\" behind their leader. \n  \n Pyongyang resident Ri Song-gun told AP he had cast his vote of approval for his district's candidate. \n  \n Image copyright AP Image caption The election is the first to be held under the leadership of Kim Jong-un \n  \n Image copyright AP Image caption Voters queued to cast their ballots - but there was only one choice on the ballot paper \n  \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Voting 'yes' to the named candidate is seen as the electorate's duty \n  \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Entertainment was laid on in the streets of the capital, and voters were encouraged to celebrate \n  \n \"I will devote all my intelligence and strength to fortify our socialist system centred on the masses, which was built and developed by our great generalissimos,\" he said. \n  \n The vote comes three months after the brutal and sudden execution of Mr Kim's once-powerful uncle, Chang Song-thaek. \n  \n North Korea announced on 13 December it had executed Chang after convicting him of \"acts of treachery\". ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

This evidence involves the earliest unambiguous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for causing tuberculosis. The 17,000-year-old bison remains not only provide insights into the history of tuberculosis but also shed light on its evolutionary origins and transmission between species.\n\nPaleontological and molecular studies on the bison's remains led to the identification of tuberculosis-inflicted lesions on its bones. This finding suggests that tuberculosis has been present in the animal kingdom for an extended period, and the disease has evolved and adapted over thousands of years. Additionally, the presence of tuberculosis in a wild animal such as the bison implies that the bacterium could have been transmitted between different species through natural processes like inhalation, ingestion, or contact with infected bodily fluids. \n\nFurthermore, the discovery of tuberculosis in the ancient bison contributes to the understanding of the history and evolution of this disease in both humans and animals. Ancient human remains have also exhibited signs of tuberculosis, with some dating back to around 9,000 years ago. These findings indicate that the disease has affected various creatures, including wild animals, domesticated animals, and humans, throughout history.\n\nIn conclusion, the animal found with 17,000-year-old damage from tuberculosis is a bison from Wyoming. This discovery provides significant evidence of the earliest unambiguous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and important information about the disease's evolution and transmission across species. It is an invaluable contribution to the understanding of tuberculosis and offers a historical context for ongoing research and efforts to eradicate the disease."

If we add all of these together, it's like we're gathering all your y's in one place. This is our first step.\n\nSo, let's add -14, -74, and -107 together. When we do that, we get -195. So, our equation now looks like this: 0 = -195*y - 1170.\n\nNow, in order to solve the problem, we have to isolate \"y\". To do this, we should move \"-1170\" over to the other side of the equation. This is similar to if you were to move a toy from one side of your room to the other. Instead of taking away -1170, you're going to add 1170 to both sides, because if you add something, it's like moving it to the other side. So, we get 1170 = -195*y.\n\nNext, we divide both sides of the equation by -195 to isolate \"y\". This is just like if you have 195 pieces of candy and you want to divide it evenly among your friends, you'd figure out how many each friend would get. \n\nSo when we do that calculation, we find that -1170 divided by -195 equals 6.\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is y = 6. This means that if you replace \"y\" in your original equation with \"6\", both sides of your equation will be equal, just like how both sides of a seesaw are level when they're balanced."

Tortricidae is a large family with over 10,350 species described, and is the sole member of the superfamily Tortricoidea., although the genus \"Heliocosma\" is sometimes placed within this superfamily. Many of these are economically important pests. Olethreutidae is a junior synonym. The typical resting posture is with the wings folded back producing a rather rounded profile.  - Olethreutinae is a subfamily of moth in the family Tortricidae.  - In biological classification, especially zoology, the type genus is the genus which defines a biological family and the root of the family name.  - `` Lasperesia '' and `` Lespeyresia '' redirect here . These are misspellings of Laspeyresia , which was invalidly established for the genus Cydia and actually refers to the noctuid moth genus Laspeyria . Cydia is a large genus of tortrix moths , belonging to the tribe Grapholitini of subfamily Olethreutinae . Its distinctness from and delimitation versus the tribe 's type genus Grapholita requires further study . Moths in this genus are generally small and dull brown ; their caterpillars are yellow or white and wormlike . Cydia includes many species of economic importance due to the damage their caterpillars inflict as pests of agricultural crops , especially fruit and nut trees . On the other hand , some Cydia species have been used for biological control of invasive weeds , and many of these small moths and their caterpillars are an important food source for other animals . A few species from the Hawaiian Islands are suspected to be extinct due to disappearance of their foodplants . Another well - known species is the Jumping Bean Moth ( C. deshaisiana ) , whose caterpillars live in Sebastiania seeds , turning them into the famous `` Mexican jumping beans '' .  - Zoology (UK: , zoo-OL-luh-jee; US: , zoh-OL-luh-jee) or animal biology is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from Ancient Greek , \"zion\", i.e. \"animal\" and , \"logos\", i.e. \"knowledge, study\".  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \"binomial\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \"Homo\" and within this genus to the species \"Homo sapiens\". The \"formal\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \"Species Plantarum\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \"Pinax theatri botanici\" (English, \"Illustrated exposition of plants\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species.  - A genus (\u00a0genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.

Actor William Shatner, who is no stranger to futuristic tech, recently purchased two e-bikes for him and his wife.  I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the $3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the $1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as  traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the $1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description."

Prideaux is shot and captured. Amid the international incident that follows, Control and his right-hand man George Smiley are forced into retirement. Control dies of illness. Percy Alleline becomes the new Chief, with Bill Haydon as his deputy, and Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase as key lieutenants. Despite Control and Smiley's misgivings, their successors had already begun a secret operation\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"Witchcraft\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094to obtain Soviet intelligence, which is being exchanged with the CIA for US intelligence. Smiley is brought out of retirement by Oliver Lacon, the civil servant in charge of intelligence, to investigate a claim by Ricki Tarr, a British spy, that there has been a long-term mole in a senior role in the Circus, as Control had suspected. Smiley chooses a trustworthy agent, Peter Guillam, and retired Special Branch officer Mendel to help him. He interviews Connie Sachs, who was sacked by Alleline after deducing that Alexei Polyakov, a Soviet cultural attach\u00c3\u00a9 in London, was a spy. Tarr tells Smiley that, on a mission to Istanbul, he had had an affair with Irina, a Soviet agent. She wanted to reveal the name of a mole in the top ranks of the Circus, but when Tarr reported this to London, they ignored him and ordered him straight home, whereas Moscow immediately kidnapped Irina. Tarr concluded that the mole had intercepted his message, and went into hiding, suspected of defecting and murdering the British station chief. Smiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr called: he finds the pages for that night are cut out, suggesting that Tarr's story is true. Smiley interviews Prideaux, who after brutal interrogation was exchanged by the Soviets but sacked from the service. Prideaux says the purpose of the mission to Hungary was to get the name of the mole. Control had codenamed the suspects \"Tinker\" (Alleline), \"Tailor\" (Haydon), \"Soldier\"..."

        "value": "Lindsay Lohan was taken into custody at the end of Friday's hearing in her necklace theft case after the judge sentenced her to 120 days in jail for violating her drunk driving probation. The actress was expected to post a $75,000 bond at the jail and be freed. The judge granted the bond after her lawyer filed a notice of appeal. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner also ordered Lohan to serve 480 hours of community service, including 360 hours at a downtown Los Angeles women's center. Sautner suggested Lohan might behave better after seeing \"how truly needy women and women who have fallen on real hard times have to live.\" She must complete another 120 hours of community service at the Los Angeles County morgue. The judge also ruled Friday that the necklace theft case against Lohan will go forward to trial, but the felony charge was reduced to a misdemeanor. \"I'm going to give her an opportunity,\" Sautner said. Sautner did not buy the defense argument that Lohan accidentally walked out of a Venice, California, jewelry store wearing a necklace that later appeared around her neck in photographs taken five days later. \"If in fact it was an accident, she could have called the store back,\" Sautner said. Defense attorney Shawn Holley argued that Lohan was busy and scattered when she was at the store and absent-mindedly walked out with the necklace. \"It's undisputed that Ms. Lohan walked out of the store with the necklace on,\" Holley said. The prosecution must show she had \"specific intent to permanently deprive the store of that necklace.\" \"I see the intent here and the level of brazenness to say 'Let me see what I can get away with here,' \" Sautner said. A police detective testified that Lohan's assistant handed the necklace to a police officer after learning through a website posting that police had obtained a search warrant hours earlier to search for it in her home. Prosecutor Danette Meyers argued that \"it doesn't take a rocket scientist\" to realize Lohan returned the necklace to police because she knew her home was about to be searched. Lohan's trial date was set for June 3, but she must return to court for a hearing May 11, the judge said. A misdemeanor could still result in up to a year in prison for Lohan. Before delivering the good news to Lohan about the reduction of the charge, the judge addressed her much-publicized misbehavior. \"She thumbs her nose at the court,\" Sautner said, referring to an incident with another judge last year. \"She walks into court with 'F U' on her fingernails. I don't know what that means unless it has 'I am' before it.\" The jeweler who accused Lohan of stealing the gold and diamond necklace testified Friday that she had not gotten any money from selling the security camera video of the actress in her store. Kamofie and Company owner Sofia Kamen was the second witness called by the prosecution in the preliminary hearing. Holley used the the store's licensing of the video, for a reported $40,000, to question Kamen's motives in accusing Lohan of theft. All of the money from the video licensing went to publicist Christopher Spencer, who Kamen said she fired last month because he was negotiating deals for the store that she was not interested in, she testified. Spencer subsequently disputed Kamen's account. Kamen said that she realized the necklace was missing 10 minutes after the actress left the store last January. She wasn't closely watching Lohan, even though there was another incident four days earlier in which the actress almost walked out wearing a diamond earring. \"We thought it was an accident,\" Kamen said. \"We weren't thinking that she would take it.\" The first prosecution witness was Tinelli Comsooksri, a store employee who was working the day of the earring incident. \"She was covering the earring that she still left on with her hair,\" Comsooksri said. She stopped Lohan as she was walking out, Comsooksri said. As prosecutor Meyers held the infamous necklace, now known as \"People's Exhibit 2,\" Kamen testified that it was priced at $2,500 although it cost the store only $850. She explained that retail jewelers routinely triple the wholesale price. The value of the necklace was a crucial issue for Lohan for the felony grand theft charge to be reduced to a misdemeanor. Shoplifting offenses are charged as petty theft if the property taken is valued at less than $950. Lohan has been in court nine times in the past year, mostly for hearings related to probation violations for her 2007 drunk driving case. She did a short stint in jail last year, but she also checked into substance abuse rehab twice under court order.\nSummarize the highlights of this article."

First, we need to add the numbers on the right side of the equals sign: -143 + 735 + 768\n- Think of it like adding up your candies from three different bags.\n\n-143 + 735 = 592 (You can think of it as having 735 candies and eating 143 of them) \n\nNow, we have 592 + 768.\n\n592 + 768 = 1360\n\nSo now, our equation looks like:\n53*j - 177 = 1360\n\n2. Now, we need to get rid of the -177 on the left side. To do that, we will add 177 to both sides:\n53*j - 177 + 177 = 1360 + 177\n\n-177 + 177 becomes 0, so now we have:\n53*j = 1537\n\n3. Now, we need to find the value of 'j'. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 53:\nj = 1537 \u00f7 53\n\n4. Finally, let's do the division:\n1537 \u00f7 53 = 29\n\nSo the value of 'j' is 29."

        "value": "\"Store\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense in the context of the question because it provides a logical and relatable scenario. When we break down the question and the given information, we can understand why \"store\" makes the most sense.\n\nQuestion: He got a job dancing and waving an advertisement, he got to be outside instead of stuck inside the what?\n\nThe question describes a situation or a job where the individual is required to dance and wave an advertisement. From this context, we can deduce that the person must have been involved in some form of promotional activity or marketing campaign. It is common for businesses and stores to hire people to dance, wear costumes, or wave signs outdoors to attract customers' attention and increase foot traffic inside the establishment.\n\nNow, let's analyze each possible answer:\n\nA. Advertisement\nThis option doesn't make sense as an answer because the question already mentions the individual waving an advertisement. Being stuck inside an advertisement isn't a plausible scenario, as advertisements are not physical places.\n\nB. Magazine\nA magazine, like an advertisement, is not a physical location where a person can be \"stuck inside.\" Magazines contain advertisements but are not directly related to the context.\n\nC. Store\nA store is a physical location where people work, shop, and conduct business transactions. A person can be inside a store and interact with customers or perform various tasks related to the job. So, the individual's prior job could have been an indoor position at a store. The new job as an advertisement waver allows them to be outside in contrast to their previous role.\n\nD. Web page\nA web page is a digital platform, not a physical location, so it doesn't align with human common sense to be a suitable answer. People cannot be physically \"stuck inside\" a web page.\n\nE. Bus\nAlthough a bus is a physical location, it doesn't align with the context of the question. Generally, buses are not associated with dancing or waving advertisements. Individuals who work in buses typically have roles such as drivers or ticket collectors.\n\nBased on this analysis, \"store\" is the most aligned answer with human common sense because it offers a relevant and plausible scenario. A person working inside a store as an employee, and later obtaining a job as a dancer or waver for an advertisement, would likely appreciate the opportunity to work outdoors instead of being confined within the store premises. This connection between the two job environments makes \"store\" a sensible choice in this context."

        "value": "Among the given options, animals lack green pigment chlorophyll. Since animals do not possess chloroplasts, which are the cellular structures that contain chlorophyll, they cannot engage in the process of photosynthesis like plants do. The green pigment chlorophyll plays a crucial role in capturing light energy and converting it into chemical energy during photosynthesis. This chemical energy is stored in the form of glucose, which serves as an essential source of energy for the plant's growth and sustenance.\n\nIn contrast, animals obtain their energy through consuming other organisms, either directly or indirectly. Instead of producing their own glucose via photosynthesis, animals consume plants or other animals to access the nutrients and energy they require to survive and maintain their bodily functions. In this way, animals depend on chlorophyll-containing plant life for sustenance, despite not housing the green pigment themselves.\n\nAs for the other options provided:\n\n- Hearts: Animals typically have some form of circulatory system, with many possessing a heart that pumps blood throughout their bodies, supplying oxygen and nutrients to their cells.\n- Skin cells: Animals have skin cells that form a protective barrier shielding the body from external harm and assisting in the regulation of body temperature and moisture.\n- H2O: Animals, like all living organisms, require water (H2O) to maintain their vital life processes. Water is essential for numerous cellular functions and biochemical reactions.\n- The body's largest organ: Animals have various organs, and the largest is usually the skin, which serves to protect, regulate, and maintain homeostasis within the organism.\n- Organic matter: Animals are composed of organic matter, including carbon-based molecules that constitute their cells and tissues.\n- Characteristics: Animals possess many distinct characteristics and features, which are typically linked to their evolutionary adaptations and ecological niche.\n- Chemical energy: Animals do not produce their own chemical energy through photosynthesis like plants do. However, they obtain chemical energy from consumed food, which is then utilized for various bodily functions.\n\nIn summary, animals lack the green pigment chlorophyll, as they do not contain chloroplasts. This pigment is essential for plants in the process of photosynthesis, which is how plants produce chemical energy. Animals, on the other hand, obtain their energy and nutrients through consuming plants or other animals, not through photosynthesis."

It tells us which animal we are discussing, and as the sentence's primary focus, knowing that it is about giraffes establishes the context for understanding the rest of the sentence.\n\n2. \"Leaning\" \u2013 This verb defines the action or movement the giraffes are performing. Without this word, we would not know what they are doing. \"Leaning\" implies that the giraffes are bending or tilting their bodies or heads in a certain direction, which helps paint a mental image of the scene.\n\n3. \"Low\" \u2013 This adjective describes the extent or manner of the leaning action. Without \"low,\" we would not have a clear idea of how these giraffes are leaning. We might wonder if they were leaning just a little or much more. By specifying that they are leaning low, this word adds depth to the mental imagery of the scene, helping us picture the giraffes in this specific posture.\n\n4. \"Eat\" \u2013 This word reveals the purpose or reason for the giraffes' leaning action. It is essential for understanding the context and intention behind their movement. By knowing they are eating, we get a complete picture of the scene\u2014giraffes bending low to consume something. Without \"eat,\" the sentence would not have a clear purpose.\n\n5. \"Ground\" \u2013 This word denotes the location or source from which the giraffes are eating. It is essential for understanding the scene because it clarifies what the giraffes are eating from and why they need to lean low. Without the mention of \"ground,\" we could be left wondering if the giraffes were eating from a tree or another source. Knowing they are eating from the ground helps create a precise mental image and understanding of the action taking place.\n\nIn conclusion, the words \"giraffes,\" \"leaning,\" \"low,\" \"eat,\" and \"ground\" are the most important words in the sentence \"Giraffes leaning low to eat from the ground.\" Each of these words plays a significant role in developing the primary context, action, purpose, extent, and location of the sentence, providing a clear and detailed understanding of the situation being described."

These options can be removed from consideration.\n\nStep 4: Assess the remaining options. We are left with two options - emergency room and hospital. The emergency room is specifically designed for dealing with urgent and life-threatening medical conditions, whereas a hospital offers broader medical services, including treatment for less urgent issues.\n\nStep 5: Choose the most appropriate option.

The review starts off by confirming that the product indeed meets their requirement of providing 3 pounds of yellow mustard seeds.\n\nThe customer also mentions that the seeds arrived in good condition and within clear plastic bags, which they considered as efficient for storage. However, they did have a suggestion for improving the packaging by using a resealable bag or transferring the seeds to an appropriate container for cooking or other uses, which indicates that they experienced a minor dissatisfaction with the packaging aspect of the product.\n\nIn summary, despite the slight inconvenience with the packaging, the overall review is positive, reflecting the customer's satisfaction with the quality of the seeds. The focus on the content of the package (the seeds) outweighs the concern with the packaging, and the customer's needs were ultimately met."

Plot title: Seven Movie plot: In an unidentified city of constant rain and urban decay, Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is preparing to retire and leave the horrors of the city. Before he retires, he is partnered with Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), a cocky, young and short-tempered cop from Springfield, a comparatively small town. The two investigate the murder of a highly obese man (Bob Mack) who was fed spaghetti until a kick to his stomach burst him open. Somerset investigates the murder while Mills is given the murder case of Defense Attorney Eli Gould (Gene Borkan), with GREED written in Gould's blood on the floor. Gould was forced to carve a pound of flesh off of his body, and subsequently bled to death. The police captain gives Somerset an evidence container with three slivers of a plastic-like material found in the stomach of the obese man, which he was forced to consume along with the spaghetti. Going to the victim's house, Somerset finds three groove marks in front of the refrigerator and finds that the plastic-like slivers fit into them perfectly. Knowing the slivers resulted from the refrigerator being moved, Somerset looks behind it. He finds the word GLUTTONY written behind the fridge in grease, along with a note containing a quote from Milton's Paradise Lost. Somerset theorizes that a serial killer is basing his crimes on the Seven Deadly Sins, with five more to go.To give Mills and Somerset a chance to get along with each other, Mills's wife, Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) invites Somerset over for dinner. While they are eating, a train passes by on the track nearby, making the building and all its contents and inhabitants tremble: the couple mention that that's why the realtor was so nervous for them to see the apartment quickly. After Tracy goes to bed, Mills and Somerset examine case evidence from the two scenes. They find a picture of Gould's wife with blood painted around the eyes. Realizing that this means she is supposed to spot something about the murder scene that nobody else would, the detectives... My question: What is Somersets advice?"

Un maestro espiritual es alguien que ha recorrido el camino espiritual y ha adquirido sabidur\u00eda y conocimientos que pueden iluminarnos y guiarnos en nuestra b\u00fasqueda personal de crecimiento y auto-realizaci\u00f3n. Para construir una relaci\u00f3n saludable con un maestro espiritual, es esencial elegir a una persona que respetemos y admiremos genuinamente, y cuya ense\u00f1anza y ejemplo nos inspiren a desarrollarnos en el proceso de aprendizaje espiritual.\n\nParte 2: Estableciendo una conexi\u00f3n\n\nUna vez que hayamos identificado a un maestro espiritual adecuado, el siguiente paso es establecer una conexi\u00f3n genuina con \u00e9l o ella. Podemos hacer esto a trav\u00e9s de una comunicaci\u00f3n abierta y honesta, compartiendo nuestras experiencias, preguntas y preocupaciones. Deber\u00edamos estar dispuestos a escuchar atentamente las ense\u00f1anzas del maestro y a aplicarlas a nuestra vida diaria siempre que sea posible. Es importante tambi\u00e9n cultivar la humildad y la sinceridad en nuestra interacci\u00f3n con el maestro espiritual, ya que un enfoque genuino y de coraz\u00f3n abierto ayuda a fortalecer nuestra conexi\u00f3n.\n\nParte 3: Establecer l\u00edmites adecuados\n\nAl relacionarnos con un maestro espiritual, es fundamental establecer l\u00edmites adecuados. Esto implica respetar la privacidad y la autonom\u00eda del maestro, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n nuestras propias necesidades y l\u00edmites personales. Debemos ser conscientes de la diferencia entre la dependencia emocional y la gu\u00eda espiritual genuina. Un maestro espiritual est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed para ense\u00f1arnos y guiarnos, no para resolver nuestros problemas emocionales o personales. Mantener l\u00edmites saludables es clave para evitar la dependencia y para asegurar que nuestra relaci\u00f3n con el maestro espiritual sea beneficiosa para ambas partes.\n\nParte 4: Cultivar la confianza mutua\n\nLa confianza es un componente esencial en cualquier relaci\u00f3n, y la relaci\u00f3n con un maestro espiritual no es una excepci\u00f3n. Ambas partes deben ser honestas y transparentes en sus interacciones. Como estudiantes, debemos tener la confianza en que nuestro maestro espiritual tiene nuestras mejores intenciones en mente y que su conocimiento y experiencia pueden ayudarnos en nuestro camino. Por otro lado, el maestro espiritual deber\u00eda sentir que podemos ser confiables y que estamos comprometidos en seguir sus ense\u00f1anzas con sinceridad y dedicaci\u00f3n.\n\nParte 5: Ser pacientes y comprometidos en el proceso\n\nEl crecimiento espiritual es un viaje a largo plazo que puede incluir tanto desaf\u00edos como logros. Por lo tanto, es vital ser pacientes y comprometidos en nuestra relaci\u00f3n con nuestro maestro espiritual. No debemos esperar cambios dr\u00e1sticos o resultados inmediatos; en cambio, debemos estar dispuestos a invertir tiempo y esfuerzo en el proceso y a aplicar sus ense\u00f1anzas con perseverancia y determinaci\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n es importante recordar que nuestra relaci\u00f3n con nuestro maestro espiritual puede cambiar y evolucionar a lo largo del tiempo, y debemos estar abiertos a la posibilidad de adaptarnos a los cambios a medida que crecemos y aprendemos juntos.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, la relaci\u00f3n con un maestro espiritual es una parte valiosa y crucial en nuestro camino espiritual. Al establecer una conexi\u00f3n aut\u00e9ntica, estableciendo l\u00edmites adecuados, cultivando la confianza mutua, y siendo pacientes y comprometidos en el proceso, podemos formar una relaci\u00f3n saludable y enriquecedora con nuestro maestro espiritual que nos ayudar\u00e1 a crecer y desarrollarnos en nuestra b\u00fasqueda espiritual."

In the old days, they might not have focused so tightly on just two characters, and there were some enticing moments when I hoped they were going to let some other people have a few lines. But these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused. The plot got me by the throat fairly early on, and never let go.

Understanding how \"Nearby Friends\" works on Facebook:\nNearby Friends is a feature on Facebook that allows you to discover which of your friends are near your current location. This feature is entirely optional and can be switched on or off according to your personal preferences. Upon activation, you and your friends both need to turn on Nearby Friends and choose to share your location with each other for it to work. Both of you will then be shown in each other's Nearby Friends screen with an accurate location.\n\nThe distance it shows is straight line or \"as the crow flies\", not by road distance. It doesn't show a kilometre by kilometre location but rather a general idea of the distance, and hence it might not always be completely accurate.\n\n2. Engaging with someone on Facebook who is not on your friend list:\nNo, it's not a mistake to like or comment on someone's post on Facebook who is not in your friend list. It completely depends on the privacy settings of the person whose post you're liking or commenting on. If they have set their post's privacy to 'public', any Facebook user can view, like or comment on the post. However, if their privacy settings are set to 'friends only', then only people in their friends list will be able to interact with the post. Always ensure to respect others' privacy while interacting on social media.\n\n3. Do those questions have the same meaning?\nFrom your questions, it seems you're asking specific, separate things about Facebook's features and etiquette. They are not really having the same meaning. The first question is about how a specific feature works on Facebook, the second is about the social etiquette and privacy when interacting with posts by non-friends on Facebook, and the third appears to be asking for a comparison in meaning between the first two questions. \n\nEach step is justified as an attempt to accurately and clearly address your questions separately, providing a detailed explanation about Facebook's functionality and social media etiquette for each one."

The Encyclop\u00e9die, for example, narrowly escaped seizure and had to be saved by Malesherbes, the man in charge of the French censure. Indeed, many publishing companies were conveniently located outside France so as to avoid overzealous French censors. They would smuggle their merchandise across the border, where it would then be transported to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers. The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice. In one case, political books were the most popular category, primarily libels and pamphlets. Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself. The second most popular category, \"general works\" (those books \"that did not have a dominant motif and that contained something to offend almost everyone in authority\") demonstrated a high demand for generally low-brow subversive literature. However, these works never became part of literary canon, and are largely forgotten today as a result.\n\nQuestion: What was the term given to books that did not have a dominant motif and contained something to offend almost everyone in authority?"

The student of John McCrae Secondary School had been tackled hard during a game four days before, hitting her head and neck on the ground.\u200b\n\nA coroner's inquest into her death began on Tuesday at Ottawa City Hall featuring testimony from a former CFL quarterback and two of Stringer's friends.\n\nIn the days before she was tackled on May 8, 2013, Stringer said she had a headache, was tired and had bags under eyes, according to friend Michelle Hebert.\n\nHebert said Stringer texted her indicating she would play the May 8 game because \"nothing would stop me unless I'm dead.\"\n\nStringer then texted she would not get her head checked out because, \"what's some brain damage gonna hurt.\"\n\nHebert also testified she and Stringer searched concussions on the internet, but she believed her friend never told her parents or any adults about the headaches.\n\nDuring the inquest's opening statements, the presiding counsel to the coroner, Mark Moors, said Stringer died from Second Impact Syndrome, where a pre-existing injury followed by another head blow can cause death.\n\nMoors, who also played professional football in the Canadian Football League, said the case was unique in part because the inquest had Stringer's text messages describing her health in between concussions, providing a window into her health during that time.\n\nStringer, who was the rugby team's captain, had stayed awake for a few moments after sitting up from the hit, then fell unconscious.\n\nShe was taken to hospital where doctors tried unsuccessfully to relieve the pressure in her head. She died after her family decided to discontinue life support.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Stringer's friend and rugby teammate Judy Larabie said the teen called her injuries \"warrior wounds\" and wore them with pride.\n\nLarabie recounted the event that led to Stringer's death, saying she passed the ball to Stringer but did not see her being tackled. Larabie then saw Stringer lie on the ground, sit up and then fall back.\n\nSome of the jurors asked Larabie about the violent nature of rugby, but she said rugby was \"not like war, it's a fun game.\"\n\n\"Not a lot of deaths in rugby. It's not a violent sport,\" she said.\n\nEarlier in the day, former CFL quarterback Matt Dunigan said it takes courage and strength for a young athlete to tell a coach about a head injury.\n\nDunigan said it is hard to get youth to admit to a head blow. He said he was fiercely competitive when he played and from what he's heard, so was Stringer.\n\nRowan Stringer, pictured here carrying a ball, loved rugby and was the captain of her high school team. (Family photo)\n\n\"It would have been hard to put up her hand and say, 'I'm injured,'\" Dunigan testified on the phone from Texas.\n\nDunigan, who played in the Canadian Football League for more than a decade, said he had 13 diagnosed concussions and suspects he suffered many more. He said football and rugby have similar risks and there is a lot of pressure to return to the field.\n\nDunigan still supports teens playing those sports, but he said when his son, also a quarterback in football, suffered his third concussion in Grade 9, they made the difficult decision to step away from the sport.\n\nThe inquest into Stringer's death, which continues on Tuesday, will examine the circumstances surrounding her death including areas of head injury recognition in high school field sports. The jury may make recommendations aimed at preventing similar deaths.\u200b\u200b\n\nWrite a title for it."

He thought for a moment before deciding on the perfect course of action: he was going to gift his good friend William with a CD by the same artist. He knew that this was no ordinary collection of songs, but rather a compilation filled with magic that had the power to inspire and lift one's spirits.\n\nExcitedly, Adam shared his decision with William, whose eyes lit up with pure joy. Grateful for the thoughtful gesture, William eagerly accepted the CD and marveled at the album art, which showcased the brilliant creativity and vision of the artist. He knew that Adam's generous gift held endless hours of musical bliss within its compact disc, and the prospect of discovering more about the mysterious artist filled him with anticipation.\n\nOver the next few weeks, William dove headfirst into the fascinating world created by the musician. Through their poignant lyrics and complex compositions, he found solace in the music during difficult times and experienced the unadulterated joy that can only be born from the union of sound and emotion, a testament to the captivating power of art.\n\nIn time, both William and Adam found themselves attending concerts and following the artist's journey. They formed a deeper bond, their friendship solidified not only by their shared love for the music, but also by the emotional connections it helped foster. Through laughter and tears, they found solace in the music and a sense of belonging; it became more than just a shared favorite artist, but an indelible part of their lives.\n\nUltimately, Adam's decision to share the CD with William had profound consequences for both of them. It opened doors they would have never even known existed and forged a friendship that would never fade, all the while leading them on a wondrous journey filled with spine-tingling melodies, powerful lyrics, and the beauty that comes when two souls are bound together by the magic of music."

Context: A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words! Question: Why was Patch hungry? Options: - not enough information - a bird had stolen his food - he had given his last nut to another squirrel - it was two days since he had found a nut"

Amazing, right? \n\nWell, that's sort of what happened in a far away icy place called Antarctica. Some researchers from New Zealand found a really really old fruitcake, that's a cake made with pieces of fruit in it. They think the cake was brought there by a man named Robert Falcon Scott and his team in 1911. The cake was kept inside a tin, like a lunch box, and as the place is super-cold almost all the time, the cake never got spoiled.\n\nThe cake still looks new, but it smells a bit of old butter. But no one is going to try a bite of it, because people working with old things like this don't taste them, that's an important rule they have. \n\nThis cake and other old things were found in some very special huts. These huts are important because they were the first buildings ever built in Antarctica, and now, a few hundred people visit them every year. The cake is now back on its shelf in one of these huts."

The State Council has organized an investigation team to probe   into what caused the disaster in the city of Linfen, North China's Shanxi Province. Preliminary  investigations show the illegal mining of an unauthorized seam , and the number of miners who had been sent down the shaft far exceeded its capacity. This mine was found to have long ignored the rules to steal state coal, and did not have a list of miners employed to check the number of miners missing after the accident. How did such a coal mine get all the necessary licenses for production? How did it pass the three safety inspections the local government organized last month? In response to this disaster, the Shanxi governor promised to set up hotlines for people to report illegal coal mines and rewards as high as 100,000 yuan for _  We appreciate the action this governor has taken to solving the coal mining problems, and we believe that the reporting scheme will help to stop the existence of illegal coal mines. But at the same time we have reason to question how governments at various levels supervise these mines. The sad fact that such a mine with serious safety problems could pass three consecutive  local government safety inspections in a month is enough to tell us how ineffective the safety inspections were. What if these inspections were just a formality ? What if the inspectors were bribed by the mine owners to turn a blind eye to the safety dangers? We can well imagine what would happen if reports about mine problems were handled by such officials. So a thorough probe must find out who are responsible for the death of so many miners. A real safety inspection and management system must be established to guarantee that safety dangers will be removed. What is NOT one of the causes of this coal mine accident? A) The workers didn't operate properly. B) The mine didn't obey the rules to mine for coal. C) A lot more miners than allowed were working under the mine. D) The safety inspections were ineffective."

If you have rosacea, pay attention to any changes in your eyes. Signs of an allergic reaction include:  Watery eyes Eyes that hurt Red eyes Swollen eyes Most people know when they have an eyelash in their eye because it feels like something is in your eye. Eye mites can also make you feel like a foreign body is in your eye. Your eyelids may also feel itchy and you might experience a burning sensation in your eyes. You should also consider if your vision has changed. If your eyesight becomes blurry, you may have eye mites. Unfortunately, you won't be able to look at your eyelashes and eyelids and tell if you have eye mites. They're so small that they can only be seen under magnification. But, you may notice your eyelids become thicker or crusty if you have eye mites. And, you might lose eyelashes if you have mites. Your eyelid can also look red if you have eye mites, especially along the margin or edge. The risk of eye mites increases as you age. Some studies estimate that over 80% of people over the age of 60 have eye mites and that these tiny creatures may are present on many children too. People with the skin disorder rosacea often have eye mites. Eye mites are just as common in men as in women with a similar distribution worldwide regardless of race. If you experience any of these symptoms, you might have eye mites. Unfortunately, they're so small that you can't tell if you have them just by looking at your eyes. And, since many of these symptoms could be caused by other eye problems, you'll have to go to the doctor to know if you have eye mites. You can also ask your eye doctor to make an eye mites diagnosis or check your eyes for another eye condition that could be causing your symptoms. Your doctor will have you sit at a slit-lamp. If you've ever had your eyes checked, the eye doctor used a slit-lamp. You sit with your chin and forehead on a support while a bright light and microscope examine the front of your eye. The doctor will look for the small mites which will be attached to the base of your eyelash. Sometimes, the doctor will pull out an eyelash or two to examine under a microscope.  Some doctors will pull an eyelash in order to show you the mites under the microscope. If the doctor doesn't see any mites, you'll be checked for other conditions that could be causing your eye irritation (like allergies or a foreign object in your eyes)."

Since your skin gets drier as you mature, a hydrating cleanser is likely your best choice. After you wash your face, use a soft towel to blot your face dry. Don't rub your face\u2014this can stretch out your skin, especially in the delicate area around your eyes. Hydrated skin looks healthier, so use a lightweight face cream after you wash your face. This is especially important under your eyes\u2014if your skin is dry, it will look saggy, which will emphasize any lines in the area. In addition, powder can settle into the creases around your eyes, making the area look heavy.   During the day time, it's a good idea to use a moisturizer that contains sun protection if you don't use a separate product. Opt for a product with at least SPF 30. You may also want to use a separate lifting or firming eye cream at night. If you have a tube of product, squeeze out a very small amount onto your finger on a brush. If you have a tube of product, swipe a brush across the product. Either way, apply the primer or base to your eyelids just above your lashes, then blend it upward above your crease. This will give your eyeshadow something to adhere to.  The skin on your eyelids thins as you get older, making them more translucent. That means they'll appear slightly purple, blue, or red. An eyeshadow primer or base will help cover that, creating a smooth canvas for your makeup while making you look more bright-eyed and refreshed. Make sure to apply the product lightly to ensure it doesn't crease. When you put on eyeshadow, small particles of pigment typically fall onto your cheeks and under your eyes. This is called eyeshadow fallout, and if you've already applied foundation and concealer, the fallout can get trapped. If you do your eyeshadow first, you can brush away the fallout before applying the rest of your makeup. Fallout can emphasize any dark circles under your eyes, making you look tired or ill."

Prior to statehood, the region was part of the Territory South of the River Ohio, more commonly known as the Southwest Territory. The Southwest Territory was created in 1790 from land ceded to the U.S. federal government by the state of North Carolina.\n\nThe process leading to Tennessee's statehood began with a popular movement within the Southwest Territory advocating for the establishment of a state government. This movement culminated in a constitutional convention that was held in Knoxville in January 1796. At this convention, delegates from across the territory drafted a state constitution and submitted it to the United States Congress for consideration.\n\nOne of the key figures in Tennessee's statehood was John Sevier, a veteran of the Revolutionary War and a prominent political leader in the territory. He became a strong advocate for statehood and was later elected as Tennessee's first governor.\n\nAfter reviewing the submitted constitution, the U.S. Congress passed an act admitting Tennessee into the Union on June 1, 1796. Tennessee thus became the first territory to gain statehood through a grassroots movement and subsequent constitutional convention, establishing a precedent for how territories would be admitted as states in the future."

We can plan another game night once Mark is feeling better.\n\nBen: That's a good idea. Let's make sure to give Mark a call later to check on him and perhaps tease him a bit about the fun we had tonight.\n\nJim: (Laughing) I'm sure he would appreciate a bit of friendly banter. Now, let me explain the rules of this new game. It's called \"Uncharted Galaxies,\" and the objective is to explore and conquer planets in an uncharted galaxy.\n\nKen: Sounds interesting. Let's get everything ready before 8 pm so we can start on time.\n\nThe friends continue setting up the game while discussing strategies and sharing a few laughs. It's apparent that despite Mark's absence, Ben, Jim, and Ken are determined to make tonight a fun and memorable game night.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAfterward:\n\nThe clock strikes 8 pm, and Ben, Jim, and Ken gather around the table to begin their game night filled with laughter and friendly competition. Although they miss Mark's presence, they continue to enjoy themselves and look forward to future game nights when all four friends can come together again."

The butcher nodded, acknowledging Vuk's information and took a deep breath, both of them fully aware of the gravity of the situation they found themselves in. The infected, once humans, now roamed their city and hunted the few survivors left, turning them into more of their own kind. Vuk and the butcher had joined forces out of necessity, as teamwork greatly increased their chances of survival.\n\nAs the butcher finished reloading, he handed Vuk a spare revolver he had picked up earlier, ensuring they both had a means to defend themselves. Sensing they shared a mutual understanding, both men knew they would have to trust one another in order to navigate the treacherous landscape of their once-familiar world. They crept closer to the corner, weapons in hand, prepared to confront whatever horrors lay beyond it.\n\nVuk peeped around the corner, trying to discern the location of the infected that killed the one who had almost taken his life. The smoke billowing from the seemingly impossibly tall stack made it difficult to see anything at first, but gradually, Vuk could make out certain shapes and lines in the dense mist. He saw the silhouette of a hunched figure, blood dripping down its now lifeless face, but no sign of the one responsible for it. Vuk knew he had to be careful \u2013 one wrong move, and it would mark the difference between life and death for both him and the butcher.\n\nThe butcher, sensing Vuk's hesitation, devised a plan. He pulled a jury-rigged Molotov cocktail from his bag and lit the cloth trapped in the bottle's mouth. He whispered to Vuk, \"On the count of three, I'll throw this into the mist. It should give us a clear line of sight and force whoever took down that infected toward us.\" Vuk nodded, knowing the situation required risks, and they braced themselves for what was to come.\n\nAs the butcher counted down, Vuk tightened his grip on the revolver, his heart pounding in his chest. The moment the butcher reached \"three,\" he hurled the makeshift weapon as far away from them as possible, letting it shatter and explode in a burst of fire. Flames engulfed part of the mist, revealing the empty top of the smokestack and a horde of infected converging on the source of the noise and light.\n\nTaking advantage of the chaos, a masked figure slid down the ladder from the smokestack, landing in a crouch next to the pair. The butcher and Vuk aimed their weapons at him, unsure whether their mysterious savior intended to help or harm. The figure raised his hands, his voice low and measured as he explained how he had been following them for some time, admiring their tenacity and resourcefulness. He had taken out one of the infected just in time to save Vuk from certain death, but had remained hidden, not wanting to reveal his presence until he felt it was absolutely necessary.\n\nVuk, recognizing he owed his life to this stranger, realized they needed all the help they could get in this new, hostile world. In a somber tone, he offered the figure an opportunity to join them in their journey for survival. Expressing gratitude for their trust, the stranger accepted, introducing himself as Marek. The butcher, Vuk, and Marek formed a reluctant but determined alliance, vowing to lean on each other amid the harsh new reality they were thrust into.\n\nTogether, the trio faced both the infected and the dangers of the desolate environment, forging ahead into the unknown, doing whatever it took to cling onto life for just one more day. Their journey through adversity tested the limits of their trust, ingenuity, and resilience. But it was in this crucible\u2014this unforgiving, dystopian world\u2014that they discovered the true depths of their character and the lengths to which they would go to preserve their humanity."

A first, small dome was patented, constructed by the firm of Dykerhoff and Wydmann on the roof of the Zeiss plant in Jena, Germany. A larger dome, called \"The Wonder of Jena\", opened to the public in July 1926. Some 20 years later, R. Buckminster Fuller named the dome \"geodesic\" from field experiments with artist Kenneth Snelson at Black Mountain College in 1948 and 1949. Although Fuller was not the original inventor, he is credited with the U.S. popularization of the idea for which he received U.S. patent 2,682,235 29 June 1954. \n\nThe geodesic dome appealed to Fuller because it was extremely strong for its weight, its \"omnitriangulated\" surface provided an inherently stable structure, and because a sphere encloses the greatest volume for the least surface area.\n\nNow, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions:\n\n1.

The game was the eleventh consecutive primetime game between the two and the sixth in Green Bay, with the Bears winning two of the last three. Entering week seven, the Bears led the all-time series 93-91-6. In the teams' last meetings since the turn of the decade, the Bears had lost all but three games, including the most recent game in 2015, a 17-13 victory in Green Bay. The Bears were struggling to score in 2016, averaging a league-worst 16.8 points per game. As such, Jeff Joniak wrote the Bears needed to score touchdowns, especially considering their struggles in the red zone (on 19 trips to the region, the Bears scored only nine times). Outside of the red zone, the Bears scored only 10 points; in comparison, the NFL average was 37. Chicago's rushing attack faced a Green Bay defense that allowed only eight runs of at least ten yards and 3.4 yards on first down, the third-lowest in the league. On defense, the Bears faced Aaron Rodgers; while the Packers offense was only 26th in yardage and at -3 in turnover ratio, the unit led the league in third down completion percentage. Rodgers also excelled in the first quarter of games, where he had thrown four touchdown passes, good for second in the league, and a 106 passer rating. However, the Packers struggled on drives starting within their own 20-yard line, failing to score on 14 such drives, the only team unable to do so. Joniak also wrote the team needed a \"spark\"; defeating the Packers at Lambeau for the second straight season would \"do wonders for a young team trying to find its way.\" After the Bears punted on the opening drive, the Packers took the lead first with Mason Crosby's 32-yard field goal. The Bears were forced to punt again on their next series and the Packers reached as far as the Bears' one-yard line before they were stopped on fourth down. On Chicago's resulting drive, Brian Hoyer was hit by Clay Matthews and Julius Peppers while throwing a pass, breaking his left arm. With Jay Cutler also inactive, third-string quarterback Matt Barkley took over for the next possession. With Barkley, the Bears were able to score points via Connor Barth's 39-yard field goal, which the Packers responded with Crosby's 40-yard kick. On Green Bay's first drive of the second half, Leonard Floyd strip-sacked Rodgers, recovering the fumble in the endzone to give the Bears the 10-6 lead. The score marked the Bears' first defensive touchdown since 2014. Rodgers overcame the play by throwing a five-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams, followed by two more touchdown passes to Adams and Randall Cobb of four and two yards, respectively (though Crosby missed an extra point). Down 26-10, the Bears' next two series ended with interceptions, Barkley being intercepted by Blake Martinez and Nick Perry. The 1-6 start marked the first start with such a record since 2000.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question. Which players had defensive takeaways?"

However, if you convince yourself beforehand that the pain won't be so bad, you might not suffer as much. According to a recent study, the part of your brain that reacts to severe pain is largely the same part that reacts to expectation of pain. Researchers in this study worked with 10 volunteers, aged 24 to 46. Each volunteer wore a device that gave out 20-second-long pulses of heat to the right leg. There were three levels of heat, producing mild, moderate, or strong pain. During training, the volunteers would first hear a tone, followed by a period of silence, and then feel a heat pulse. They then learned to associate the length of the silent pause with the intensity  of the upcoming heat pulse. The longer the pause, the stronger the heat pulse would be, causing more severe pain. A day or two later, the real experiment began. The researchers found that the parts of the brain involved in learning, memory, emotion, and touch became more active as the volunteers expected higher levels of pain. These were mainly the same areas that became active when participants actually felt pain. Interestingly, when the volunteers expected only mild or moderate pain but experienced severe pain, they reported feeling 28 percent less pain than when they expected severe pain and actually got it. The new study emphasizes that pain has both physical and psychological elements. Understanding how pain works in the mind and brain could eventually give doctors tools for helping people cope with painful medical treatments. Options: A To provide the patient with more pain killers. B To talk to the patient and ease his/her worries. C To give the patient strong heat pulses beforehand. D To emphasize the possible severe pain to the patient. Answer: B To talk to the patient and ease his/her worries."

It is one of the world's most successful companies built on it's famous motto 'Don't be evil'. But a report by Business Insider says rather than peace and love, Google is filled with fierce relationships that would not be out of place in Game of Thrones. Behind the modern glass doors of the internet giant's California headquarters are complex stories of sex and intrigue. One member of staff told Business Insider: 'Inside Google, it's a Game of Thrones.' A report suggests Google is filled with sex scandal and political intrigue that would not be out of place in Game of Thrones, starring Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister. Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, where insiders say bosses are trying to clamp down on in-fighting. Former staff told the website that the politicking that goes on behind the scenes is reminiscent of the secret networking in the famous book and television series. According to sources quoted by Business Insider, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin actively encouraged loud and angry debate among their subordinates. But divisions within the company's various strands have now reportedly become so deep, that bosses are now trying to stamp out the in-fighting that was once so encouraged. Business Insider said that during a conference in Napa Valley in February, Page told senior executives that the warring had to stop and there would be 'zero tolerance for fighting.' The alleged change in stance comes after rumoured rivalries between the likes of former search and product executive Marissa Mayer, who is now CEO of Yahoo, and Salar Kamangar, CEO if YouTube. It was not only the networking and politicking that has been likened to Game of Thrones, in which mythical aristocracy and royalty battle for the crown. One member of staff said: 'Inside Google, it's a Game of Thrones'. Pictured: Court meddlers Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish (right) and Varys (left) Google co-founder Sergey Brin was involved in a recent sex scandal after it emerged he was dating Google worker Amanda Rosenberg. The book and series' sex and dangerous liaisons also has similarities to life at Google, according to insiders. The. most famous recent 'scandal' involved married Google co-founder Sergey. Brin who, it emerged last month, had an affair with Google Glass. employee Amanda Rosenberg. She had also previously dated Google executive Hugo Barra, according to reports. Although Google has a written code of conduct involving relationships with colleagues, staff say bosses mostly turn a blind eye. The internet giant's code states: 'If a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved. \u2018When faced with a potential conflict of interest, ask yourself: Would this activity harm my reputation, negatively impact my ability to do my job at Google or potentially harm Google? Google co-founders Sergey Brin, left, and Larry Page, actively encouraged fierce debate among staff, according to the report. \u2018Would this activity embarrass Google or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or blog? If the answer to any of these questions is \u201cyes\u201d, the relationship or situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should avoid it.\u2019 However, as Business Insider states, in Douglas Edwards' book about the launch of the company 'I'm Feeling Lucky: The Confessions Of Google Employee Number 59' relationships with co-workers were common. Mr Edwards quotes HR worker Heather Cairns as saying: 'hormones were flying and not everyone remembered to lock their doors.' But as one Google worker told Business Insider: 'In a place like Google, which has strong technical talent as well as business talent, it's very natural that people are going to be attracted to one another.' Google did not immediately respond to a request for a comment."

But now, they want to stop the fighting and make everyone work together nicely. Also, the article talks about romantic relationships between people who work at Google. Sometimes, these relationships can cause problems in the company. Google has rules about this, but they don't always follow them."

When you stand on the shore and look at the waves, it seems like the water is moving towards you. But the water is not really moving forward. The moving you see is wave energy. And wave energy comes from the wind. Let's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles   of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball. So why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore?When a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because _ meets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest , keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore. Shorelines are changing all the time because of wave action. Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? Options: A: Wave energy comes from the water.

Hide Caption 12 of 12 \n  \n The government's case centers on Menendez's relationship with Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist who the senator has called a friend and political supporter. Melgen and his family have been generous donors to the senator and various committees the senator is associated with. \n  \n Investigators have focused in part on plane trips Menendez took in 2010 to the Dominican Republic as a guest of Melgen. In 2013, after word of the federal investigation became public, Menendez paid back Melgen $58,000 for the 2010 plane trips calling his failure to properly disclose the flights an \"oversight.\" \n  \n Menendez said he has been friends with Melgen for more than 20 years and the two families have spent holidays and other special occasions together. \n  \n One of the highest ranking Hispanic members of Congress, Menendez is a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has become one of the Obama administration's most vocal Democratic opponents on two key foreign policy matters -- President Obama's decision to ease the trade embargo against Cuba and also his effort to engage direct negotiations with Iran over that country's nuclear program. \n  \n Menendez advocated on Melgen's behalf with federal Medicare administrators who accused Melgen of overbilling the government's healthcare program, according to court documents and people briefed on the probe. Melgen was among the top recipients of Medicare reimbursements in recent years, during a time when he was also a major Democratic donor. Melgen's attorneys have denied any wrongdoing. \n  \n Prosecutors also are focusing on whether Menendez broke the law in advocating for Melgen's business interest in a Dominican Republic government contract for a port screening equipment. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, at the time, considered donating port screening equipment to the Dominican Republic, which would have hurt the contract of Melgen-controlled company. \n  \n Menendez, now serving his second full term as senator, led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2009-2011. \n  \n During a Senate subcommittee hearing in 2012 , Menendez didn't mention ICSSI, Melgen's company, by name, but he did press Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Rooney about an unnamed company who had a contract to X-ray cargo that went through all Dominican ports -- a contract that, he said, Dominican authorities \"don't want to live by.\" \n  \n \"If those countries can get away with that, they will,\" the senator said. \"And that puts American companies at a tremendous disadvantage.\" \n  \n Menendez's office said at the time the senator's interest was based on his efforts to combat narcotrafficking in the region. \n  \n Other lines of inquiry against Menendez had included allegations he solicited prostitutes in the Dominican Republic , and that he violated the law helping win permanent U.S. residency for two Ecuadorian banking magnates, the Isaias brothers. The prostitution allegations collapsed after the purported prostitutes recanted their story, and the FBI didn't find evidence of wrongdoing in the Isaias matter, according to people briefed on the probe. \n  \n The FBI probe has already spawned a legal battle between the government, Menendez and his former aides. Last week, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals briefly posted, apparently by accident, documents detailing legal efforts to block certain evidence and testimony the government wants to use. \n  \n The documents were quickly put back under seal, but not before a reporter with the New Jersey Law Journal secured a copy and later published a story. \n  \n According to the documents, Menendez's lawyers have sought to claim emails and testimony from aides is protected by the constitutional protections given to members of Congress in carrying out their duties. The speech and debate clause prohibits questioning of members of Congress about \"legislative acts or the motivation for legislative acts.\" \n  \n The fight centers in part on the Justice Department's attempt to compel testimony from Menendez's aides, some of whom have refused to answer questions to a grand jury. \n  \n According to the documents, the government wants to question aides about a series of 2012 calls and meetings on Melgen's fight with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency. Among these is a meeting among Mendedez, Sen. Harry Reid and then Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The government is also pushing to use emails between Menendez's office and a CBP official about the Dominican ports issue. \n  \n A federal district court ruled in favor of the government to compel testimony from Menendez's aides, but the appeals court reversed the ruling and ordered a hearing. \n  \n \"The parties primarily dispute the legislative character of Senator Menendez's two conversations with [then acting CMS administrator Marilyn] Tavenner and his meeting with Secretary Sebelius,\" the appeals court said. \"These communications are not manifestly legislative acts because they are informal communications with executive branch officials, one of whom was at the time a presidential nominee whose nomination was pending before the United States senate.\" |||||\nWhat is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?"

        "value": "10 Emails That Could Cost You Your Job\n\n\u201cWe had been emailing back and forth all morning,\u201d Maria Cutrone, 30, a Baltimore-based web designer recalls. She and a coworker couldn\u2019t see eye-to-eye on a project. Should they ask the client to postpone the deadline in order to complete testing or should they deliver a product that wasn\u2019t quite there? \u201cBy the time 10 emails had been sent, I was seriously beyond frustrated. We weren\u2019t getting any closer to resolving the situation. I had to do something.\u201d\n\nFor Cutrone, that \u201csomething\u201d was cc\u2019ing their direct supervisor. \u201cIt really felt like the right thing to do. The way I saw it, he would see what was happening, step in and make the decision we were unable to make. End of argument.\u201d\n\nWrong. Unfortunately, Cutrone\u2019s \u201ccc\u2019ing up\u201d was a bad career move. Her coworker was furious and her supervisor was not just let in on a revealing email chain, but saw Cutrone\u2019s decision to do so as both self-serving and immature. Shortly after, Cutrone left the company, embarrassed, she says, but much wiser.\n\nA decision she made with the best intentions had been perceived as the worst. Instead of efficient, she was seen as undermining. Instead of gracious, petty.\n\nAccording to experts, she\u2019s not alone. Email makes up the majority of our daily communication\u2014especially in business. According to the Pew Research Center, the majority of employed adults (62%) use the internet or email in the workplace. And yet social cues and etiquette are often overlooked.\n\nThe problem, it seems, is that communication through email can bring out the worst of competitive or controlling behavior. \u201cIt\u2019s a very weird dynamic that has happened,\u201d says Cherie Kerr, the founder of ExecuProv, an executive coaching seminar series that borrows from improvisational comedy and the author of The Bliss or \u201cDiss\u201d Connection: Email Etiquette for the Business Professional. \u201cPeople do or say things via email that they would never do in person. They\u2019d never upstage a higher up in a meeting, but in email there\u2019s this disconnected feeling of not having to look anyone in the eye that emboldens people to act in competitive or even arrogant ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmily Post was not around when email began,\u201d agrees Marsha Egan, author of the book Inbox Detox and the Habit of Email Excellence. \u201cSo people have to make up their own rules. What one person might see as absolutely fine, another might find offensive. That being said, the basis of all etiquette is respect.\u201d Respect, she says, is what Cutrone was lacking in her decision to invite her boss into her disagreement with her coworker.\n\nHere, Egan and Kerr take on Cutrone\u2019s misstep and other serious email faux pas\u2014to explain how even the best intentions can be misread\u2014and what the better tack to take might be.\n\nWrite a one or two sentence summary."

As a result of the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, the Congo Basin is claimed by King Leopold II of the Belgians, who rules the Congo Free State in personal union with the Kingdom of Belgium. The country is on the verge of bankruptcy, Leopold having borrowed huge sums of money to finance the construction of railways and other infrastructure projects. He sends his envoy L\u00e9on Rom to secure the fabled diamonds of Opar. Rom's expedition is ambushed and massacred. A tribal leader, Chief Mbonga, offers Rom the diamonds in exchange for an old enemy: Tarzan. The man once called \"Tarzan\", John Clayton III, has left Africa behind and settled down in London with his American-born wife, Jane Porter. He took up his birth name and ancestral family residence as Lord Greystoke. In the eight years since returning from Africa, John's story as Tarzan has become legendary among the Victorian public, although John wants to leave that past behind. Through the British Prime Minister, John is invited by King Leopold to visit Boma and report on the development of the Congo by Belgium; he declines to participate in the perceived publicity stunt."
