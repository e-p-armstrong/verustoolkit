    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in launching a new currency or token using decentralized crowdfund mechanisms in Verus. Can you explain how I can do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, you can launch a new currency or token using decentralized crowdfund mechanisms. This involves setting required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies. If the minimums are not met by the start time of your currency or token, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their preconversions, less the network fees. Would you like to know more about the launch options available for crowdfunding a new currency or token in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that would be helpful. What are some of the launch options available for crowdfunding a new currency or token in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides various launch options for crowdfunding a new currency or token, including:\n\n1. Setting maximum participation in one or more currencies.\n2. Offering pre-launch discounts to early participants.\n3. Allowing price-neutral pre-allocations to select VerusIDs, which increase the reserve ratio to issue currencies.\n4. Providing price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds.\n5. Including vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs.\n\nThese options give you flexibility in structuring your crowdfund launch to suit your needs. Do you have any questions about these options or would you like to know more about the process?\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if the minimum participation levels are not met during a crowdfund launch in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the minimum participation levels are not met by the start time of your currency or token, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their preconversions, less the network fees. This ensures that participants are not left with unwanted or unsold tokens or currencies. It's a safety net to protect participants in case the launch doesn't meet the required minimum participation.",
