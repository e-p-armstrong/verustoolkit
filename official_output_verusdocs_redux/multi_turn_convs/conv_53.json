    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm new to Verus and I'm trying to understand what VerusIDs are all about. Can you explain what VerusIDs are, and what can they be bound to?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are digital identities that can be bound to various things, including individuals, other VerusIDs, content, data, and provable information. They can also hold funds and serve as personal profiles, corporate websites, or government portals. They're really versatile and can be used in many different ways.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What makes VerusIDs more than just identities or NFTs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are more than just identities or NFTs because they can hold funds, be revoked and recovered, set time locks, and be controlled by multiple identities. They also allow for signing and verifying data, files, and messages, and have added privacy features through z-addresses. They're really powerful and offer a lot of functionality.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that VerusIDs are important for creating PBaaS-chains, tokens, and currencies on the Verus blockchain. Can you explain the significance of a VerusID in this context?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is necessary to create PBaaS-chains, tokens, and currencies on the Verus blockchain. The name assigned to the VerusID is also the name of the PBaaS-chain, token, or currency. Additionally, each PBaaS-chain has standard VerusID support, and creators of these chains can assign the costs of identities themselves, which will be paid in the native coin of the PBaaS-chain. So, VerusIDs are a fundamental building block for creating new blockchain-based assets and ecosystems.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Can I choose a friendly name for my VerusID, and are there any restrictions on the characters I can use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, each VerusID can have an easy-to-remember name chosen by the user. And, all characters from all character sets are available to create a VerusID, except for a few restricted characters (/ : *? \" < > | @.). So, you can choose a name that's easy for you to remember and that fits your needs.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, how do VerusIDs support worldwide adoption?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs support worldwide adoption by allowing users to create identities with characters from all character sets, making it easier for people from different regions and languages to create and use VerusIDs. This means that people from all over the world can easily create and use VerusIDs, regardless of their language or region.",
