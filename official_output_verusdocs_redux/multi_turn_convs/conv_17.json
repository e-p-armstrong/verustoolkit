    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in launching a currency on Verus that has a 1:1 mapping to an ERC-20 on Ethereum. Can you walk me through how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a currency on Verus with a 1:1 mapping to an ERC-20 on Ethereum, you need a VerusID with the same name as the currency you want to create. The controller of this VerusID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and it can only be done once. You also need to have enough VRSC in the namespace VerusID to cover the launch cost. Additionally, you need to specify the Ethereum smart contract address of the ERC-20 you want to map to in the `address` field. Are you planning on launching a currency soon?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I think so. But before I do, I want to know what the costs are going to be. What's the cost of launching a currency on Verus with a 1:1 mapping to an ERC-20 on Ethereum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe cost of launching a currency on Verus is 200 VRSC. Additionally, you need to have a VerusID of the same name as the currency, which costs 100 VRSC (or 80 VRSC when using a referral). Alternatively, you can use a.vETH subID, which costs an amount of Bridge.vETH (0.01 vETH worth). It's a one-time payment, and it's a relatively small cost considering the benefits of having a currency on Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I'm still a bit unclear on the role of VerusIDs in all this. What's the purpose of a VerusID in the context of launching a currency on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is required to launch a currency on Verus. The controller of the VerusID with the same name as the currency is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and it can only be done once. Think of the VerusID as a unique identifier that gives you control over the currency. It's a way to prove ownership and ensure that only the intended person can create and manage the currency. Does that make sense?",
