    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to learn more about the Verus protocol. Can you tell me what are the key characteristics of Verus as a decentralized public blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus is open, borderless, public, neutral, and censorship-resistant. Anyone can participate and contribute, regardless of who they are or where they come from. Does that help? Do you have any other questions about Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. How can I participate in the Verus Protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAnyone can start mining and staking the Verus Protocol. Mobile phones and ARMs (e.g. Orange Pi 5) are energy-efficient devices to mine Verus with. To stake, there are no minimum requirements or locking of funds. It's pretty easy to get started!\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that Verus had a fair launch. What does that mean exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus had a fair launch, meaning that everyone had, and still has, equal opportunity to collect its currency through mining and staking. This is characterized by the absence of an ICO, founder or developer fees/tax, premine, commercial interests, and rent-seeking behavior. It's a truly community-driven project.\n\n**User:**\nHow did the team announce the launch of the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe launch of the Verus blockchain was announced on the Bitcointalk.org forum 15 minutes before the first block could be mined. It was a pretty low-key affair, but it's been growing ever since.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, where can I see the distribution of Verus coins?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can take a look at the rich list to see the coin distribution. It's all transparent and publicly available.",
