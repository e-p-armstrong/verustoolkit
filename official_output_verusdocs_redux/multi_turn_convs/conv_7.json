    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use Verus Desktop, and I need some help with locking a VerusID. How can I lock a VerusID for a specific period of time using the command line interface of Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo lock a VerusID for a specific period of time, you can use the `setidentitytimelock` command with the `unlockatblock` option. For example, to lock an ID for approximately 1 year, you can use the following command:\n\n```\nrun setidentitytimelock \"myid@\" \n'{\n  \"unlockatblock\":1508994\n}'\n```\n\nReplace `\"myid@\"` with your own VerusID. This will lock the ID for a specified number of blocks, which can be calculated based on the average block time.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I've also heard of something called a DelayLock on a VerusID. Can you tell me what that is and how I can set it up?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA DelayLock is a feature on Verus that allows you to lock a VerusID and specify a predetermined number of blocks that must pass before the funds can be spent again. To set up a DelayLock, you can use the `setidentitytimelock` command with the `setunlockdelay` option. For example, to set a DelayLock of 1 week (10,080 blocks), you can use the following command:\n\n```\nrun setidentitytimelock \"myid@\" \n'{\n  \"setunlockdelay\":10080\n}'\n```\n\nReplace `\"myid@\"` with your own VerusID. This will set a DelayLock on the ID, preventing the funds from being spent until the specified number of blocks has passed.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens when I request an unlock on a VerusID with a DelayLock?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you request an unlock on a VerusID with a DelayLock, you will have to wait for the predetermined number of blocks to pass before you can spend the funds again. During this time, the funds are locked and cannot be spent. Once the specified number of blocks has passed, the DelayLock will be lifted, and you'll be able to access the funds again.",
