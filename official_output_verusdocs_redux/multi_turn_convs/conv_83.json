    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the different flags in a VerusPay invoice. Can you explain what the VERUSPAY_INVALID flag does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VERUSPAY_INVALID flag (0) indicates that an invoice is invalid and should not be processed. This default state can be used to signify that an invoice should not be actionable. Do you have any other questions about VerusPay invoice flags?\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the VERUSPAY_VALID flag? What does it signify?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VERUSPAY_VALID flag (1) signifies that an invoice is valid and can be processed. This flag must be set for the invoice to be considered actionable. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that's clear. What about the VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_CONVERSION flag?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_CONVERSION flag (2) allows payments in different currencies, with conversion to the invoice's requested currency. If an invoice accepts conversion, it requires a max estimated slippage value. This flag gives more flexibility to the payment process.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does the VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_NON_VERUS_SYSTEMS flag indicate?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_NON_VERUS_SYSTEMS flag (4) indicates that payments from non-Verus blockchain systems are accepted. If this flag is set, specifying accepted systems is required. This flag allows for more compatibility with other blockchain systems.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the VERUSPAY_EXPIRES flag?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VERUSPAY_EXPIRES flag (8) determines that the invoice has an expiry condition. If set, the invoice must be paid before a specific Verus blockchain height is reached, and an expiry height must be set. This flag adds an extra layer of control to the payment process.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does the VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_ANY_DESTINATION flag allow?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_ANY_DESTINATION flag (16) allows the invoice to accept payments to any destination. If set, the destination field in the invoice must be left blank. This flag gives more flexibility to the payment destination.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does the VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_ANY_AMOUNT flag indicate?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_ANY_AMOUNT flag (32) indicates that the invoice can be paid with any amount. This is useful for donations or when the exact payment amount is not fixed. If set, the amount field in the invoice must be left blank. This flag allows for more flexibility in the payment amount.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the effect of setting the VERUSPAY_EXCLUDES_VERUS_BLOCKCHAIN flag?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VERUSPAY_EXCLUDES_VERUS_BLOCKCHAIN flag (64) means that the invoice cannot be paid on VRSC/VRSCTEST. This flag restricts the payment options for the invoice.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, what does the VERUSPAY_IS_TESTNET flag signify?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VERUSPAY_IS_TESTNET flag (128) marks the invoice as only valid on VRSCTEST and/or testnet PBaaS blockchains, and establishes that all currencies/identities referenced within the invoice exist only on testnet. This flag is useful for testing purposes.",
