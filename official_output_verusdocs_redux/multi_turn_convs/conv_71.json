    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've heard great things about Verus and I'm curious about launching currencies on the platform. What are the advantages of launching currencies on Verus compared to EVM-like protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLaunching currencies on Verus is a great choice. Compared to EVM-like protocols, Verus offers several advantages. Launching currencies on Verus is better, faster, cheaper, and more secure than on EVM-like protocols. Plus, no coding is involved in the process. This makes it more accessible to a wider range of users.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. What types of currencies can be launched with the Verus Protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith the Verus Protocol, you can launch two types of currencies: basket currencies (like liquidity pools) and simple token currencies. Both types can be issued in a decentralized or centralized manner with minting and burning capabilities.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about subIDs on Verus. Can you explain what they are and how they differ from VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSubIDs on Verus are powerful objects that are similar to VerusIDs, but they cannot be used to launch blockchains or currencies. They are created from a launched currency and have similar properties to VerusIDs.\n\n**User:**\nAnother thing I'm curious about is basket currencies on Verus. How do they function, and what's their purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBasket currencies on Verus function like automated market makers (AMMs) and have reserves. They allow users to convert between different currencies or tokens on the Verus network, including bridged currencies. The basket currency supply is dynamic and depends on the amount converted to or from the basket currency.\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to know more about basket currencies. What is the reserve ratio or weight of a basket currency, and how does it affect the currency's volatility?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe reserve ratio or weight of a basket currency is the percentage of its reserves that back the currency. A lower reserve ratio means the currency is more volatile when users convert into or out of the basket currency. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to its reserves and reserve ratio. This is an important factor to consider when working with basket currencies on Verus.",
