    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a currency in Verus, but I'm a bit unclear about how it works. What happens to the funds needed for initial contributions when defining a currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen defining a currency in Verus, the funds needed for initial contributions must be in the rootID. After the preconversion time frame is over and the currency is launched, the rootID receives an amount of the launched currency. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks. I've also heard about basket currencies, but I'm not entirely sure how they work. What is a basket currency, and how is it different from a simple token currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA basket currency is a type of currency that can hold reserves of other currencies. It is different from a simple token currency in that it has an \"initialsupply\" parameter, which is required for basket currencies (options:33). This parameter does not work with simple token currencies. Do you want to know more about basket currencies?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please. What is the purpose of the \"initialsupply\" parameter when defining a basket currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"initialsupply\" parameter is a required parameter for basket currencies (options:33). It specifies the initial supply of the currency during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People preconverting into the reserves receive from this initial supply. Do you have any more questions about basket currencies?\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if \"initialcontributions\" and/or preconversions are not specified when defining a basket currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf \"initialcontributions\" and/or preconversions are not specified when defining a basket currency, the initial supply cannot go anywhere, and the currency is bricked. Make sure to specify these parameters correctly to avoid this issue.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. One more question about basket currencies. How does the supply of a basket currency change immediately after it is launched in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nImmediately after a basket currency is launched, the supply can be larger due to \"preallocations\". This means that the initial supply is allocated to specific addresses, which can increase the overall supply of the currency.",
