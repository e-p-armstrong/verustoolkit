    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in using VerusIDs for commerce, but I want to make sure I can do it privately and without needing an escrow. How can I use VerusIDs to engage in private and escrow-free commerce?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs can be used to create a private and escrow-free way to engage in commerce. You can create a VerusID with a contract that gives access to a specific asset or service, and then create a transaction to pay for the VerusID. The buyer can execute the transaction, and once it's signed by all parties, the VerusID is transferred to the buyer, giving them access to the asset or service. This can be done without posting the offer on the blockchain until the transaction is agreed upon and signed. Does that make sense? Would you like to know more about how to implement this?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. I'd like to know more about the API calls available for creating and managing offers on the Verus Marketplace. Can you tell me about those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are five API calls available for creating and managing offers on the Verus Marketplace:\n\n1. `makeoffer`: Define what you offer and for what, including funds, VerusIDs, or other currencies, and what you want in return.\n2. `takeoffer`: Take a specific offer in exchange for its request.\n3. `getoffers`: Specify which VerusID or currency you want to see offers for, and it returns all offers (buy and sell) in all currencies, sorted by highest to lowest price.\n4. `closeoffers`: Close expired or unexpired offers that you opened with `makeoffer`.\n5. `listopenoffers`: List all offers that you have opened with `makeoffer`.\n\nThese API calls allow you to create, manage, and interact with offers on the Verus Marketplace in a flexible and customizable way. Do you have any specific questions about how to use these API calls?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful. I'm also concerned about privacy when using VerusIDs for transactions. How can I ensure privacy when using VerusIDs for transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can attach a \"z-address\" to a VerusID, which is a private address that cannot be checked on the public blockchain. This allows you to keep your transactions private and secure. By using z-addresses, you can ensure that your transactions are not publicly visible, giving you an additional layer of privacy and security. Does that answer your question about privacy?",
