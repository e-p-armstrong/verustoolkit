    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been learning about Verus, and I came across something called \"destination types\" in Verus. Can you tell me more about them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, there are several destination types, each representing a specific type of destination for transactions or data. These include:\n\n* **DEST_INVALID (0)**: An invalid or unspecified destination type, used as a default or error state.\n* **DEST_PK (1)**: A public key destination, typically used for transactions directly to a public key.\n* **DEST_PKH (2)**: A public key hash destination, common in many blockchain platforms for sending transactions to a hashed version of a public key.\n* **DEST_SH (3)**: A script hash destination, used for transactions that should be processed by a specific script, enabling smart contracts or complex spending conditions.\n* **DEST_ID (4)**: A VerusID destination.\n* **DEST_FULLID (5)**: (no description provided)\n* **DEST_REGISTERCURRENCY (6)**: (no description provided)\n* **DEST_QUANTUM (7)**: Used for quantum-resistant addresses.\n* **DEST_NESTEDTRANSFER (8)**: (no description provided)\n* **DEST_ETH (9)**: Specifies an Ethereum account as the destination, facilitating cross-chain transactions with Ethereum.\n* **DEST_ETHNFT (10)**: Indicates a destination for an Ethereum-compatible Non-Fungible Token (NFT), enabling the mapping of NFTs across different blockchain systems.\n* **DEST_RAW (11)**: Represents a raw data destination, allowing for arbitrary data to be included as a destination, offering maximum flexibility.\n\nThese destination types allow for various transaction scenarios and interactions within the Verus ecosystem. Do you have any further questions about destination types or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, I do. What are flags in the context of Transfer Destination in Verus, and how are they used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the context of Transfer Destination in Verus, flags are additional attributes that can be added to a destination to indicate specific properties or behaviors. Two flags are mentioned:\n\n* **FLAG_DEST_AUX (64)**: Indicates the presence of auxiliary destinations, allowing for the specification of additional destinations within a single Transfer Destination construct.\n* **FLAG_DEST_GATEWAY (128)**: Specifies that the destination is associated with a gateway, relevant for cross-chain transactions or interactions with external systems.\n\nThese flags can be used to provide additional context or functionality to a destination, enabling more complex and flexible transactions. They allow for greater customization and control over transaction flows within the Verus ecosystem. Does that help clarify the role of flags in Verus?",
