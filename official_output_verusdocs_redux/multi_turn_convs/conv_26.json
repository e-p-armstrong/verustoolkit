    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into Verus DeFi and I was wondering, what are the benefits of Verus DeFi compared to EVM-like account-based systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi has several advantages. It is fair, cheap, and has no rent-seekers. It is also MEV-free, meaning it is resistant to front-running, back-running, and sandwich attacks. Additionally, it does not have the problems associated with EVM-like account-based systems. This makes Verus DeFi a more secure and equitable option for decentralized finance.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great. I've also been wondering about centralized currencies in Verus. What are the benefits of a centralized version of a currency in Verus, and how does it relate to the rootID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a centralized version of a currency is created in Verus, the owner of the rootID can mint currencies into existence, automatically lowering the reserve ratio, or burn currencies, automatically raising the reserve ratio. This allows for more control over the currency and its reserve ratio. The rootID is essentially the master ID that has control over the currency, and this control is what enables the owner to make these changes to the reserve ratio. This level of control can be beneficial for certain use cases, such as stablecoins or other centralized currencies.",
