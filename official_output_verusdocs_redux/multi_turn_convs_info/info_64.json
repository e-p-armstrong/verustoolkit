That namespace is a VerusID. The namespace is the name of the currency (e.g. ``MyBrand@``). That namespace can also have subIDs (e.g. ``product.MyBrand@``, ``user.MyBrand@``). The controller of this VerusID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.On Verus a VerusID registration costs between 20 and 100 VRSC, and the launch of a currency costs 200 VRSC. These costs are always paid in the chain\u2019s native coin (to the worldwide miners and stakers). On other PBaaS-chains these costs can differ since the chain launcher can define its own costs for VerusID registrations and currency launches.## Defining options\nTo define a currency, choose options. Then combine these options to whatever the currency needs to be. Just add the numbers together in the currency definition. The currency options are listed below.",
