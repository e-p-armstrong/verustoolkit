            "The VerusPay Invoice specification is designed to provide a standardized format for creating, managing, and interpreting invoices across the Verus blockchain ecosystem and beyond. It aims to ensure interoperability, security, and ease of use, making it a valuable tool for developers, merchants, and users within the Verus network and beyond.",
