            "What is staking, and how can I participate in it on the Verus blockchain?",
            "Staking is a way to secure the Verus network by using your Verus holdings. Anyone can participate in staking, regardless of the amount of Verus coins they hold. In Verus, staking is done with UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs), and a larger UTXO has a higher chance of winning a block.",

            "What is the difference between solo staking and pool staking?",
            "Solo staking involves staking with your own wallet and node, where you either win a full block or nothing. Pool staking, on the other hand, involves joining a pool of stakeholders, where the rewards are shared among the pool members. There are two types of pool staking: non-custodial staking pools, where you keep control of your funds, and custodial staking pools, where you trust a pool operator with your funds.",
