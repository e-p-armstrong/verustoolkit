            "Verus DeFi offers several benefits, including being MEV-resistant (no front/back running), having protocol-level security, and low fees. All DeFi operations take place on the consensus layer of the protocol, ensuring fairness and security. Fees are as low as 0.025% or 0.05%, depending on the conversion type.",
