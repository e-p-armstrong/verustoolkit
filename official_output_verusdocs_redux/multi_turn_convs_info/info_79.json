            "What are the key features of a blockchain launched with Verus?",
            "A blockchain launched with Verus has several key features, including:\n\n1. Full interoperability with other blockchains\n2. Customizability to meet specific needs\n3. Independence from other chains\n4. L1 Multi-currency support for basket currencies and simple token currencies\n5. L1 DeFi capabilities with consensus layer AMMs and a fully decentralized marketplace\n6. L1 VerusID support for self-sovereign identities and namespace for currencies, tokens, and PBaaS-blockchains\n7. L1 Privacy with zk-SNARKs privacy technology\n8. 51% hash attack resistance through a 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake consensus mechanism\n9. High performance with 75-800 TPS and adjustable block times\n10. Scalability through deploying more interoperable, interconnected PBaaS-chains",
