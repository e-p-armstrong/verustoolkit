            "What are simple token currencies in Verus, and what are their characteristics?",
            "Simple token currencies in Verus are currencies without reserves. They can be either decentralized, with a static supply, or centralized, where the owner of the rootID can mint new tokens and anyone can burn them. These currencies can support various use cases, including being mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s, and can be used as reserves in basket currencies.",
            "## Simple token currencies\nSimple token currencies and are just currencies without any reserves. They are not as exciting as the basket currencies, yet still offer much value. With all the parameters that can be added, subIDs created and decentralized crowdfund mechanisms, these currencies can support a lot of use cases that are difficult to do with alternative protocols.The supply of this type of currency is static when it\u2019s a decentralized version. When it\u2019s a centralized version, the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn them.This option is also used to create currencies that are mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s. Which means you can send those ERC-20s over to Verus, or from Verus to the ERC-20. This is made possible with the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge.

[Everything on the Verus-Ethereum Bridge here.](/eth-bridge/)Any currency and token, on Verus or any other PBaaS-blockchain, can be exported to Ethereum as an ERC-20. They can then be used in the Ethereum ecosystem.Also, any already existing ERC-20 token can be mapped one-to-one as a Verus currency. Meaning any ERC-20 token can live on the Verus blockchain (or any other PBaaS-chain) and take advantage of all the L1 features.",

            "The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is a non-custodial bridge that allows currencies and tokens to be sent between Verus and Ethereum. It ensures that tokens and currencies are never in anyone's custody and are proven and verified by consensus rules.
