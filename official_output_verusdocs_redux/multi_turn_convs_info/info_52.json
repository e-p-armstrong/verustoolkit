            "What are the differences between solo mining and pool mining in Verus?",
            "The main differences between solo mining and pool mining in Verus are:\n\n* In solo mining, you mine through Verus Desktop and receive full block rewards, but it may take a while to win a block depending on your hashrate. No additional software is needed to get started.\n* In pool mining, you participate in a pool to receive regular rewards. You'll need to set up a few things before you can start.",
