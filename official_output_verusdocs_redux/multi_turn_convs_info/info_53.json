            "What is Verus, and what are its main features?",
            "Verus is an open-source, decentralized blockchain protocol that uses both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake as its consensus mechanism. It offers rent-free blockchain tools for creators and organizations to build products, services, and systems. Verus is a multichain protocol that focuses on scalability, security, and decentralization, and can scale to meet global demand. It is also 51% hash attack resistant and community-built, with all coins in circulation being fairly mined and staked.",
