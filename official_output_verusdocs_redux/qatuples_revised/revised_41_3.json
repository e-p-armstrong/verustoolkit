    "What is the purpose of the \"idregistrationfees\" parameter when defining a currency in Verus?",
    "The \"idregistrationfees\" parameter is used to change the costs of registering subIDs under the rootID. The default registration fee is 100. When it's a decentralized currency, the fees are burned, making the basket currency worth more because there is less supply, yet the reserves stay the same. When it's centralized, the fees go to the rootID.",
    "Example currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"MyBusiness\", \n \"options\":33, \n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\",\"BusinessBrand\",\"DiscountBrand\"], \n \"initialsupply\":100, \n \"weights\":[0.5,0.25,0.25]\n}'\n```\n\u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called MyBusiness. During the preconversion time frame there are various currencies that can be converted into its reserves. They have different weights to them. 0.5 for VRSCTEST, 0.25 for both BusinessBrand and DiscountBrand.### **\"startblock\"**\nUse this parameter to define the block height when the currency should be launched. There is a preconversion time frame before the currency is launched. When omitting this parameter it uses a 20 block preconversion time frame before the currency is launched.The preconversion time frame is always 20 blocks, this can not be less.\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: Fill in the absolute block height you want the currency to launch on.### **\"endblock\"**\nEndblock can not be defined on basket currencies. It does nothing. It could be set as a signal to software that might use the basket currency.It can be set on centralized (`proofprotcol:2`) simple token currencies. When the endblock is reached, it turns the centralized currency into a decentralized one (no more minting and burning capabilities.)### **\"idregistrationfees\"**\nUse this parameter to change the costs of registering subIDs under the rootID. The default registration fee is `100`.\nWhen it\u2019s a decentralized currency the fees are burned (and the basket currency becomes worth more because there is less supply, yet the reserves stay the same), when it\u2019s centralized the fees go to the rootID.",
