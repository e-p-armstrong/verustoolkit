    "How does VerusHash work, and what is its relationship to the Haraka512 V2 core?",
    "VerusHash can be understood by separating the digest from the core. The Haraka512 V2 core is an abstract digest function that takes 512 bits (64 bytes) of input and produces 256 bits (32 bytes) of output. VerusHash builds on this core to take any length of input and produce a 256-bit hash result.",
    "Haraka512 V2 is designed as a short input hash to exclusively consume one chunk of 512 bits and produce 256 bits of a hash result. Utilizing Haraka512 V2 VerusHash takes any length of input and produces a 256 bit hash result, unique to VerusHash, that also provides the same security guarantees as Haraka512 V2. This makes VerusHash 256 bit secure for classical computing attacks and 128 bit secure against quantum computers for pre-image and second pre-image attacks.\n\nTo understand the VerusHash algorithm it helps to first separate the digest from the core. We then consider the Haraka512 V2 core as an abstract digest function that takes 512 bits (64 bytes) of input and produces 256 bits (32 bytes) of output. Given such a digest function, referred to as haraka512256, the most concise implementation of VerusHash, in any language to-date, is the following Python code for the VerusHash hash digest as follows:\"\n\n``` py\n# verus_hash\n    def verus_hash(msg):\n      buf = [0] * 64\n      length = len(msg)\n      for i in range(0, length, 32):\n        clen = min(32, length - i)\n        buf[32:64] = [b for b in msg[i:i + clen]] + [0] * (32 - clen)\n        buf[0:32] = haraka512256(buf)\n      return bytes(buf[0:32])\n```\n\n## PoS Problems Solved\nVerus\u2019 staking algorithm solves the two major theoretical issues undermining other PoS systems, ``Nothing at Stake`` and ``Weak Subjectivity`` by leveraging its smart transaction capabilities to remove any incentive to attempt cheating, making it a losing proposition.
