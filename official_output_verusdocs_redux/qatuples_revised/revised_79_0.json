    "What are the key features of a blockchain launched with Verus?",
    "A blockchain launched with Verus has several key features, including:\n\n1. Full interoperability with other blockchains\n2. Customizability to meet specific needs\n3. Independence from other chains\n4. L1 Multi-currency support for basket currencies and simple token currencies\n5. L1 DeFi capabilities with consensus layer AMMs and a fully decentralized marketplace\n6. L1 VerusID support for self-sovereign identities and namespace for currencies, tokens, and PBaaS-blockchains\n7. L1 Privacy with zk-SNARKs privacy technology\n8. 51% hash attack resistance through a 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake consensus mechanism\n9. High performance with 75-800 TPS and adjustable block times\n10. Scalability through deploying more interoperable, interconnected PBaaS-chains",
    "# Introduction\nLaunch blockchains that are \u2705 **fully interoperable**, \u2705 **customizable** and \u2705 **independent**. Each blockchain launched has the following L1 features.| Feature | Details | \n| :-----| :------ | \n| [L1 Multi-currency](/currencies/) | Consensus layer basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools) & simple token currencies, decentralized crowdfund mechanisms |\n| [L1 DeFi](/sendcurrency/) | Consensus layer AMMs, MEV-free, no front/back-running, solving all conversions simultaneously within a block & fully decentralized marketplace | \n| [L1 VerusID](/verusid/) | Consensus layer self-sovereign identities, namespace for currencies, tokens & PBaaS-blockchains, friendly-name addresses, revocable, recoverable, NFTs, profiles, can be bound to any type of data | \n| L1 Privacy | Consensus layer zk-SNARKs privacy technology |\n| 51% hash attack resistant | 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake. [Read the paper here.](https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf) |\n| 75 - 800 TPS | High performance blockchain, adjustable block times 10 secs - 2 mins |\n| Scaling | Scale out by deploying more interoperable, interconnected PBaaS-chains |It costs 10,000 VRSC to launch a PBaaS-chain. 5000 goes to the Verus block producers, 5000 goes to the block producers of the newly launched chain.## Launch without programming needed\nEnables any user with VerusID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, VerusID-issuing 50% PoW/50% PoS, [51% hash attack resistant](https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf) blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it.",
