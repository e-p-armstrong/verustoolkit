    "What is staking, and how can I participate in it on the Verus blockchain?",
    "Staking is a way to secure the Verus network by using your Verus holdings. Anyone can participate in staking, regardless of the amount of Verus coins they hold. In Verus, staking is done with UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs), and a larger UTXO has a higher chance of winning a block.",
    "# Staking\n\nStaking is accessible for everyone. Use Verus holdings to secure the network. It does not matter how much $VRSC you have, there are no minimum requirements to start staking.\n\nOn the Verus blockchain UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) are staking, not balances. A large UTXO has more chances of winning a block than a small UTXO. [What is a UTXO?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0UYZ9hDos)\n\n## Solo staking\nThere are a few rules you need to know before you can start staking.\n\n| Rules | \n| :-----|\n| Wallet Running | \n| Full Node Required (native mode in Verus Desktop) | \n| Staking Enabled | \n| UTXO Eligible After 150 Blocks | \n| Minimum of 0.00000001 VRSC in Wallet |\n\nWith solo staking you either win a full block or you win nothing.\n\n::: warning Need help with staking? \ud83d\udcb0\n[Join the Verus Discord #staking channel.

One is keeping control over your funds in combination with VerusID, the other is sending your coins to a pool operator and trusting your funds with them.\n\nA non-custodial staking pool: [Synergy Pool](https://synergopool.io)",
