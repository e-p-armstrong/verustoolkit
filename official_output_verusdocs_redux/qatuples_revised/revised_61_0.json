    "What is the Verus CLI wallet, and how does it differ from Verus Desktop?",
    "The Verus CLI (command-line-interface) wallet is an alternative to Verus Desktop, which allows users to interact with the Verus blockchain through the terminal. This means that instead of using a graphical user interface, users can use command-line commands to perform actions on the blockchain.",
