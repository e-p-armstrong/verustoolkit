    "What is the relationship between fees and block rewards in the Verus ecosystem?",
    "In the Verus ecosystem, fees are expected to outnumber block rewards. The protocol is designed such that the fees collected in the fee pool are added to the block rewards, making the overall reward for miners and stakers more substantial.",
    "## Fee Pool\nAll the fees generated by the protocol are collected in the ``fee pool``. With each new block, ``1%`` of the fee pool is added on top of the block rewards. It is expected that fees outnumber block rewards, making mining and staking in the Verus ecosystem a profitable and competitive endeavor.",
