    "How do I set up my hot wallet device to receive diverted staking rewards in Verus?",
    "To set up your hot wallet device, you need to lookup the pubkey for the address where you want your won stakes to arrive. You can do this by going to the Wallet tab, clicking Receive under Transparent Balance, clicking the three dots next to the address you want to use, and then clicking Copy public key. Save this pubkey somewhere, as you'll need it later.",
    "# Divert staking rewards to different wallet\n![image-divert](/images/divert-stakes.png)\nIf you are staking with funds on a VerusID, and that VerusID is locked with Vault, yet you want to spend your won stakes, this might be for you. Let's explain how you can divert your won stakes to a different wallet with Verus Desktop.\n\nWe have two devices with two different wallets:\n- Your staking device\n- Your hot wallet device\n\n### Hot wallet\nThe hot wallet is the device you want your stakes to arrive on. On the hot wallet we need to lookup the ``pubkey`` for the address you want your won stakes to arrive.\n\nGo to the ``Wallet-tab``, click ``receive`` under Transparent Balance. Then click the three-dots next to the address you want to use. Click ``Copy public key`` as seen in the image below. Paste and save this somewhere, we will need it later.\n\n![image-pubkey](/images/copy-pubkey.png)\n\n### Staking device\nThis device is staking happily, and your funds are secured with the Vault ([read here how to set up](/guides/setup-vault/)). Let's make sure your won stakes are sent to your hot wallet device.\n\nGo to ``settings`` (the cogwheel top right corner), then select ``Profile Settings`` (default). Here you see the option ``Custom native mode launch options``. Select ``Verus``.\n\nFirst copy and paste the code from below into the textfield and click ``Add launch option``.\n\n```\nminetolocalwallet=0\n```\n\nNext, copy and paste the code below. Change ``xxx`` to the ``public key`` we have from the hot wallet. Click ``Add launch option``.\n```\npubkey=xxx\n```\n\nAt last, click the ``Save Changes`` button. **Don't forget this step!** Now close the wallet and open it again. Congratulations, your stakes will now be diverted to your hot wallet.",
