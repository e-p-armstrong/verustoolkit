    "The cost of launching a PBaaS-chain on Verus is 10,000 VRSC, which is split equally between the Verus block producers and the block producers of the newly launched chain.",
    "# Introduction\nLaunch blockchains that are \u2705 **fully interoperable**, \u2705 **customizable** and \u2705 **independent**. Each blockchain launched has the following L1 features.| Feature | Details | \n| :-----| :------ | \n| [L1 Multi-currency](/currencies/) | Consensus layer basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools) & simple token currencies, decentralized crowdfund mechanisms |\n| [L1 DeFi](/sendcurrency/) | Consensus layer AMMs, MEV-free, no front/back-running, solving all conversions simultaneously within a block & fully decentralized marketplace | \n| [L1 VerusID](/verusid/) | Consensus layer self-sovereign identities, namespace for currencies, tokens & PBaaS-blockchains, friendly-name addresses, revocable, recoverable, NFTs, profiles, can be bound to any type of data | \n| L1 Privacy | Consensus layer zk-SNARKs privacy technology |\n| 51% hash attack resistant | 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake.
