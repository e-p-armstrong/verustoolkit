For a TimeLock you need to know the blockheight of the blockchain. Let's say the blockchain's blockheight is at ``1,000,000`` blocks. You want to lock your VerusID for 1 year. 1 year is ``508994`` blocks.::: warning Long-Term Locking\n**For long-term locking it's best to take an average block time of 62 seconds. Yet there are some variables that make it difficult to predict an exact time, leap years for example. Over long-term there are an average of 1394.5484 blocks per day.**\n:::",
