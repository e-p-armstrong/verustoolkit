    "What is the cost of launching a currency on Verus with a 1:1 mapping to an ERC-20 on Ethereum?",
    "The cost of launching a currency on Verus is 200 VRSC. Additionally, you need to have a VerusID of the same name as the currency, which costs 100 VRSC (or 80 VRSC when using a referral). Alternatively, you can use a.vETH subID, which costs an amount of Bridge.vETH (0.01 vETH worth).",
    "# Launch currency with 1:1 mapping of ERC-20When defining a currency it can be mapped to an ERC-20 1:1. The currency on Verus and the ERC-20 on Ethereum are then always interchangeable 1 to 1.

The community is happy to assist!](https://www.verus.io/discord)\n:::### Defining the currency\nTo create a currency of a specific name, we need a VerusID of the same name. The controller of this VerusID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and we can only do so once.The cost for a VerusID on the Verus is ``100 VRSC`` (or 80 when using a referral). The cost to launch a currency is ``200 VRSC``. Before launching we need to have enough VRSC in the namespace VerusID.You can also use a .vETH subID. The cost to register a .vETH subID is an amount of Bridge.vETH (0.01 vETH worth).In our example we have a namespace ``MyUSDC`` with which we want to launch a currency that is mapped to the Ethereum ``USDC`` ERC-20 (on Goerli testnet, [see contract address](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x98339D8C260052B7ad81c28c16C0b98420f2B46a)).Below is the command to map a currency 1:1 to an ERC-20 on Ethereum. The ``address`` field is the Ethereum smart contract address of the ERC-20 we want to map to.",
