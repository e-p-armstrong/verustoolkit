    "What is the difference between OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE and OPTION_ID_STAKING when defining a PBaaS blockchain?",
    "OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE determines whether IDs can be created permissionlessly or only by the controlling ID, whereas OPTION_ID_STAKING determines whether all IDs on the chain stake equally or based on their value.",

The controller of this VerusID is the only one who can create a blockchain of that name, and they can only do so once.## Examples of blockchain launches",
