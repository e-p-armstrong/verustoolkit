    "# Invoice SpecificationThe VerusPay Invoice specification, introduced in VerusPay v3, outlines a standardized format for creating, managing, and interpreting invoices across the Verus blockchain ecosystem and beyond. It is designed to be universally implementable across various programming languages, focusing primarily on the serialization and deserialization processes to ensure interoperability and consistency. VerusPay invoices provide a robust framework for blockchain invoice management, emphasizing interoperability, security, and ease of use. Their design facilitates a seamless payment experience across different blockchain ecosystems, making it a valuable tool for developers, merchants, and users within the Verus network and beyond.## Core ComponentsThe VerusPay Invoice construct is central to this specification, encapsulating all necessary information for a comprehensive invoice system, including:- **System ID**: If the invoice is signed by a VerusID, this is the ID system it is signed on.\n- **Signing ID**: If the invoice is signed by a VerusID, this is the address of the VerusID that signed it.\n- **Signature**: If the invoice is signed by a VerusID, this is the signature.\n- **Details**: Incorporates detailed transaction information through the VerusPay InvoiceDetails sub-component, covering aspects such as the payment amount, destination, and currency.\n- **Version**: Manages the invoice format version, facilitating future updates and backward compatibility through version flags and checks.### VerusPay InvoiceDetailsEmbedded within the VerusPay Invoice, the VerusPay InvoiceDetails component provides specific transaction-related data:",
