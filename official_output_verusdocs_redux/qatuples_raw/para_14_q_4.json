    "What makes the Verus-Ethereum Bridge secure?",
    "The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is secure because assets are never in anyone's custody. Instead, the bridge relies on the cooperation between block producers (worldwide miners and stakers), community notary witnesses, the Bridgekeeper software, and the Ethereum smart contract to verify and prove assets at each step of cross-chain transactions. This decentralized approach, combined with consensus rules and safeguards, prevents hacks and ensures the security of the bridge.",
    "| What       |     Details      |\n| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------- |\n| **Conversions**| Convert VRSC, ETH (vETH), DAI (DAI.vETH) & MKR (MKR.vETH) with each other into any direction (on/to Verus & Ethereum), or to and from the Bridge.vETH currency.|\n| **Launch mapped currencies**| Launch currencies on Verus that are 1:1 mapped to any ERC-20. [Learn how](/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html)|\n| **Export currencies as ERC-20**| Export any launched currency (simple tokens, basket currencies) on Verus as an ERC-20. [Learn how](/currencies/export-to-eth.html)|\n| **Cross-chain sends**| Send any tokens, basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools), mapped currencies etc. that are exported to Ethereum across the bridge.|\n| **Export tokenized ID control**| Export a tokenized VerusID to Ethereum as ERC-721.|\n| **Map VerusID to Ethereum NFT**| Launch a tokenized ID with a mapping of an Ethereum ERC-721 or ERC-1155.|Then there is the bridge currency Bridge.vETH, a 100% backed currency with 4 currencies in its reserves (VRSC, ETH, DAI, MKR). The Bridge.vETH currency function is to make the bridging of assets simple. From wherever you send it converts the fees that you need seamlessly.
