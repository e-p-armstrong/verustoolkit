    "What are some of the launch options available for crowdfunding a new currency or token in Verus?",
    "Verus provides various launch options for crowdfunding a new currency or token, including:\n\n1. Setting maximum participation in one or more currencies.\n2. Offering pre-launch discounts to early participants.\n3. Allowing price-neutral pre-allocations to select VerusIDs, which increase the reserve ratio to issue currencies.\n4. Providing price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds.\n5. Including vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs.",
    "## Crowdfund mechanisms\nAll currencies can be launched through decentralized crowdfund mechanisms. [Set required minimum levels](/currencies/launch-currency.html#minpreconversion) of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies. If by the start time of your currency or token, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their preconversions, less the network fees.\n\nThe launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral [pre-allocations](launch-currency.html#preallocations) to select VerusIDs that increase the reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral [carve-outs of proceeds](launch-currency.html#prelaunchcarveout), and [pre-launch discounts](launch-currency.html#prelaunchdiscount) for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n\n#",
