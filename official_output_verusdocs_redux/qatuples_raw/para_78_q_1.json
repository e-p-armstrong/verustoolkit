    "How do I claim refunds for an Ethereum to Ethereum transaction on the Verus-Ethereum Bridge?",
    "To claim refunds for an Ethereum to Ethereum transaction, you need to export your Ethereum private key from the wallet you used for the conversion (e.g., MetaMask), then import it into a Verus wallet. You can do this using Verus Mobile or Verus Desktop. Once you've imported the private key, you can add the currency you want to get back and claim your refund.",
    "# Claim refunds on the Verus-Ethereum Bridge\nCrossing the bridge costs Ethereum gas fees. Gas fees can swing in price quite dramatically in a short period of time. It can happen that when you pay for a bridge crossing the gas fees jumped up higher than what you paid for the crossing, resulting in a refund. Learn here how you can claim your refunds back.\n\n## Ethereum to Ethereum\nWhen using the Bridge website and making a conversion that goes from Ethereum to Verus and back to Ethereum, you have signed a message that created a refund address based on your Ethereum wallet's private key.\n\nThese are the steps to claim refunds when you did an Ethereum to Ethereum transaction:\n\n### Verus Mobile\n1. Export your Ethereum private key from the wallet you did the conversion with (probably MetaMask)\n2. Import that private key into a Verus wallet. The easiest way to do that is with Verus Mobile. \n- Download Verus Mobile on the Play Store or App Store\n- Add a new profile (choose username and password)\n- Choose \"import wallet\"\n- Choose \"Enter key/seed\"\n- Enter the Ethereum private key here\n- Add the currency you want to get back (click the plus-button corner-right, \"Add PBaaS currency\" and choose the one for you)\n\n### Verus Desktop\nIf you are running native mode (full node) Verus Desktop then you can import the Ethereum's private key in this way:\n\nGo to ``Settings (gear-icon top right)``, then ``Coin Settings``, then select the Verus blockchain and type the following:\n\n```json\nrun importprivkey \"ETH_PRIVATE_KEY\" \"\" true\n```\n\n::: warning Important!\nVerus Desktop will not show any progress on the import. It will take some time for the process to finish in the background.\n:::\n\n## Verus to Ethereum\nWhen bridging with Verus Desktop from the Verus blockchain to the Ethereum blockchain you had to fill in a refund address.\n\nOn the Bridge website you can use that refund address to claim the funds back.",
