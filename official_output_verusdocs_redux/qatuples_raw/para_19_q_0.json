    "What is Verus, and what are its main features?",
    "Verus is an open-source, decentralized blockchain protocol that uses both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake as its consensus mechanism. It offers rent-free blockchain tools for creators and organizations to build products, services, and systems. Verus is a multichain protocol that focuses on scalability, security, and decentralization, and can scale to meet global demand. It is also 51% hash attack resistant and community-built, with all coins in circulation being fairly mined and staked.",
    "# Introduction to VerusWelcome to the Verus documentation. Here you find all mainnet and testnet protocol features and implementations. The documentation will be updated continuously.## Open-source, rent-free, scalable public infrastructure\nVerus is an open-source, [fairly launched](/overview/#fair-launch), decentralized blockchain protocol with proof-of-work and proof-of-stake as its consensus mechanism. It offers rent-free blockchain tools for creators and organizations to build products, services and systems.Verus is a multichain protocol with strong focus on scalability, security and decentralization. It can scale to world demand, is proven 51% hash attack resistant and is community built - all coins in circulation are fairly mined and staked.With Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) anyone can launch scalable, fully interoperable, customizable and independent blockchains for public or private use. Launch tokens & basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools) on top of blockchains for any use case. Get funding and create markets with protocol level built-in DeFi and smart launch options.Protocol-level self-sovereign digital identities and namespaces ([VerusID](/verusid/)) are at the center of the Verus multichain protocol. Giving builders, communities, businesses and organizations tools never before seen.Everything happening on the Verus multichain protocol has aligned incentives with the [miners and stakers](/economy/) of the worldwide network. This makes it one of the most secure protocols with opportunities to earn.## Low-cost, rapid & easy deployment\nLaunch blockchains, tokens, liquidity pools, identities and much more without any coding needed, just simple API commands. Save money on expensive blockchain (Solidity) developers & infrastructure with the rent-free Verus Protocol.",
