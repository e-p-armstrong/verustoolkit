    "How does the supply of a basket currency change immediately after it is launched in Verus?",
    "Immediately after a basket currency is launched, the supply can be larger due to \"preallocations\". This means that the initial supply is allocated to specific addresses, which can increase the overall supply of the currency.",
    "The funds to initially contribute need to be in the rootID when defining the currency. After the preconversion time frame is over and the currency launched, the rootID has received an amount of the launched currency.Example currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"CommunityBasket\", \n \"options\":33, \n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\",\"CoinCommunity\"], \n \"initialcontributions\":[10,200], \n \"initialsupply\":100, \n \"preallocations\":[{\"Jane@\":100},{\"John@\":50}]\n}'\n```\n\u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called CommunityBasket. The launcher of the currency wanted to make initial contributions to its reserves. At the moment of broadcasting the currency to the network, there needed to be 210 VRSCTEST and 200 CoinCommunity in the rootID. The initial supply of 100 went to the rootID (if there weren\u2019t any more preconverters). At the same time of the launch, 100 CoinCommunity was minted into Jane@ and 50 into John@, this lowered the reserve ratio of the currency.### **\"initialsupply\"**\nA required parameter for basket currencies (`options:33`). This parameter does not work with simple token currencies. This is the initial supply during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People preconverting into the reserves receive from this initial supply.\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: `\"initialcontributions\"` and/or preconversions are required, otherwise the initial supply can not go anywhere and the currency is bricked.Immediately after the currency is launched, the supply can be larger due to `\"preallocations\"`.",
