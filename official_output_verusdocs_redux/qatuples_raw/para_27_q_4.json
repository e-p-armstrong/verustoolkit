    "How does VDXF facilitate interoperability across decentralized applications?",
    "VDXF facilitates interoperability across decentralized applications by providing a standardized format for exchanging data. This allows different applications to understand and use the data, even if they don't understand the entire data structure. The use of globally unique type keys and URLs to locate and decode data enables applications to work together seamlessly, even if they are developed independently.",
    "# Verus Data eXchange Format (VDXF)The Verus Data Exchange Format provides a fully interoperable system for defining data types that may consist of structured or or unstructured data and associated content or keys that may be used to retrieve such data from centralized or decentralized storage for use in and across centralized or decentralized applications.The Verus Data eXchange Format (VDXF) object is a structured data representation of the Verus Data eXchange Format, designed to facilitate the exchange of information across different systems and programming languages. It encapsulates data in a serialized byte format, making it interoperable and easy to transmit or store. This document outlines the structure and functionality of a VDXF object, focusing on its serialized form rather than the methods used to manipulate it in any specific programming language.## OverviewThe Verus Data Exchange Format enables application developers to define globally unique data types and publish references to the same, which may refer to structured or unstructured data that can be located unambiguously via an URL, which implicitly provides both location and decoding information, enabling applications to use such data, in whole or in part, if they know how, or even ignore parts of the data, while remaining compatible with those parts they understand. VDXF typee keys are globally unique identifiers, which are defined as human readable names along with a specification of how to define and convert unlimited length, human readable type names into collison-free 20 byte IDs, which can be used as type keys associated with content or location values in various forms of data records. These data records, which may have application specific structures or no structure at all, besides length form the basis of an interoperable data exchange format across decentralized applications.",
