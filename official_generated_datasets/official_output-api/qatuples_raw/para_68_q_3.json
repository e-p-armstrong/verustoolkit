    "What is the purpose of the `includeWatchonly` argument in the `z_listunspent` command?",

    "z_listunspent ( minconf maxconf includeWatchonly [\"zaddr\",...] )Returns array of unspent shielded notes with between minconf and maxconf (inclusive) confirmations. Optionally filter to only include notes sent to specified addresses. When minconf is 0, unspent notes with zero confirmations are returned, even though they are not immediately spendable.
