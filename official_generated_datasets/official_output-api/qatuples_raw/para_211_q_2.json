    "Can I use a combination of addresses and special strings in the `fromaddresses` array, and are there any limitations?",
    "Yes, you can use a combination of addresses and special strings in the `fromaddresses` array. However, there is a limitation: you cannot send funds from both Sprout and Sapling addresses simultaneously. If a special string is given, any given addresses of that type will be counted as duplicates and cause an error.",
    "Arguments: 1. fromaddresses     (array, required) A JSON array with addresses.             The following special strings are accepted inside the array:               - \"ANY_TADDR\":  Merge UTXOs from any t-addrs belonging to the wallet.               - \"ANY_SPROUT\": Merge notes from any Sprout zaddrs belonging to the wallet.               - \"ANY_SAPLING\": Merge notes from any Sapling zaddrs belonging to the wallet.             While it is possible to use a variety of different combinations of addresses and the above values,             it is not possible to send funds from both sprout and sapling addresses simultaneously. If a special             string is given, any given addresses of that type will be counted as duplicates and cause an error.   [    \"address\"     (string) Can be a t-addr or a zaddr    ,...   ] 2. \"toaddress\"      (string, required) The t-addr or zaddr to send the funds to. 3. fee          (numeric, optional, default=0.0001) The fee amount to attach to this transaction. 4. transparent_limit   (numeric, optional, default=50) Limit on the maximum number of UTXOs to merge.

Set to 0 to merge as many as will fit in the transaction. 6. \"memo\"        (string, optional) Encoded as hex. When toaddress is a zaddr, this will be stored in the memo field of the new note.",
