    "The required arguments for the `fundrawtransaction` command are:\n\n1. \"hexstring\" - The hex string of the raw transaction.\n\nThe other arguments are optional.",
    "fundrawtransaction \"hexstring\" '[{\"txid\":\"8892b6c090b51a4eed7a61b72e9c8dbf5ed5bcd5aca6c6819b630acf2cb3fc87\",\"voutnum\":1},...]' (changeaddress) (explicitfee) Add inputs to a transaction until it has enough in value to meet its out value. This will not modify existing inputs, and will add one change output to the outputs. Note that inputs which were signed may need to be resigned after completion since in/outputs have been added. The inputs added will not be signed, use signrawtransaction for that. Arguments: 1. \"hexstring\"    (string, required)   The hex string of the raw transaction 2. \"objectarray\"   (UTXO list, optional) UTXOs to select from for funding 3. \"changeaddress\"  (string, optional)   Address to send change to if there is any 4. \"explicitfee\"   (number, optional)   Offer this instead of the default fee only when using UTXO list Result: {  \"hex\":    \"value\", (string) The resulting raw transaction (hex-encoded string)  \"fee\":    n,     (numeric) The fee added to the transaction  \"changepos\": n     (numeric) The position of the added change output, or -1 } \"hex\" Examples: Create a transaction with no inputs > verus createrawtransaction \"[]\" \"{\"myaddress\":0.01}\" Add sufficient unsigned inputs to meet the output value > verus fundrawtransaction \"rawtransactionhex\" Sign the transaction > verus signrawtransaction \"fundedtransactionhex\" Send the transaction > verus sendrawtransaction \"signedtransactionhex\"",
