            "The purpose of registering a name commitment in Verus is to reserve a unique name for an identity without revealing the actual name. This allows the user to ensure that the name is available and prevents others from front-running the registration of the name. The name commitment also enables the user to specify a referral identity, parent name or ID, and source of funds, which helps to lower network costs and dictate issuance rules and pricing.",
