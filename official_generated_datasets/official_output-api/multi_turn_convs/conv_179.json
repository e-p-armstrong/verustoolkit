What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `calc_MoM` command, but I'm not sure what arguments I need to provide. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `calc_MoM` command requires two arguments. The first argument is `height`, which specifies the specific blockchain height at which to calculate the Momentum. The second argument is `MoMdepth`, which is the depth at which to calculate the Momentum. Do you have any other questions about using `calc_MoM` or Verus in general?",
