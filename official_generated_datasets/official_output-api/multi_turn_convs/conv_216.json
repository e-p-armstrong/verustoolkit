    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm trying to understand the `getreceivedbyaccount` command in Verus. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getreceivedbyaccount` command returns the total amount of VRSC received by addresses with a specified account name, in transactions with at least a certain number of confirmations. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What is the default value for the `minconf` parameter in the `getreceivedbyaccount` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default value for the `minconf` parameter in the `getreceivedbyaccount` command is 1, which means that only transactions with at least 1 confirmation are included in the calculation. Do you have any more questions about `minconf` or `getreceivedbyaccount`?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `getreceivedbyaccount` command to get the total amount received by the default account with at least 1 confirmation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getreceivedbyaccount` command to get the total amount received by the default account with at least 1 confirmation by running the following command: `verus getreceivedbyaccount \"\"`. Do you have any more questions about using this command?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `account` parameter in the `getreceivedbyaccount` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `account` parameter in the `getreceivedbyaccount` command specifies the account name for which to retrieve the total received amount. If set to an empty string `\"\"`, it represents the default account. Passing any other string will result in an error. Does that clarify things? Do you have any more questions about the `account` parameter?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `getreceivedbyaccount` command as a JSON RPC call to get the total amount received by the \"tabby\" account with at least 6 confirmations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getreceivedbyaccount` command as a JSON RPC call to get the total amount received by the \"tabby\" account with at least 6 confirmations by running the following command:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getreceivedbyaccount\", \"params\": [\"tabby\", 6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nDoes that help? Do you have any more questions about using JSON RPC calls with `getreceivedbyaccount`?",
