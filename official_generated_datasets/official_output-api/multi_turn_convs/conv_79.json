    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you with any questions you may have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to figure out this `getidentitycontent` command in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getidentitycontent` command is used to retrieve the content associated with a specific identity on the Verus network. It allows you to fetch the content stored on an identity, with optional filters and parameters to customize the result. Do you have any other questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was wondering what the required and optional arguments for the `getidentitycontent` command are.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required argument for the `getidentitycontent` command is the identity name or i-address, specified as a string in the format \"name@ || iid\".\n\nThe optional arguments include:\n\n* `heightstart`: The starting block height for the content retrieval (default=0).\n* `heightend`: The ending block height for the content retrieval (default=0, which means the maximum height).\n* `txproofs`: A boolean flag to include proof of ID in the result (default=false).\n* `txproofheight`: The block height from which to generate the proof (default=\"height\").\n* `vdxfkey`: A vdxf key for a more selective search of specific content within the identity (default=null).\n* `keepdeleted`: A boolean flag to include deleted items in the result (default=false).\n\nDo you have any more questions about these arguments or how to use them?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How can I use the `getidentitycontent` command to retrieve the content of an identity, including deleted items?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo retrieve the content of an identity, including deleted items, you can use the `getidentitycontent` command with the `keepdeleted` argument set to `true`. For example:\n\n```\nverus getidentitycontent \"name@\" true\n```\n\nThis will return the content associated with the identity \"name@\", including any deleted items. Just keep in mind that you need to replace \"name@\" with the actual identity name or i-address you're interested in.",
