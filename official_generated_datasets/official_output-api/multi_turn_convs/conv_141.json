    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `estimatefee` command in Verus. Can you explain what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `estimatefee` command estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin confirmation within a specified number of blocks. It's a useful tool for getting an idea of the fee required for a timely transaction confirmation.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What arguments does the `estimatefee` command require?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `estimatefee` command requires one argument: `nblocks`, which is a numeric value representing the number of blocks within which the transaction is expected to begin confirmation.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! What's the result of the `estimatefee` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `estimatefee` command is an estimated fee-per-kilobyte value, which is a numeric value. If there are not enough transactions and blocks observed to make an estimate, the minimum fee is returned.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `estimatefee` command to estimate the fee for a transaction to be confirmed within 6 blocks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `estimatefee` command as follows: `verus estimatefee 6`. This will estimate the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin confirmation within 6 blocks. Give it a try!",
