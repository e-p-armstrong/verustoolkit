    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `z_importkey` command in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_importkey` command is used to add a zkey (a type of private key) to your wallet. This command is typically used after exporting a zkey using the `z_exportkey` command. It allows you to import a previously exported private key back into your wallet.\n\n**User:**\nWhat arguments are required for the `z_importkey` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_importkey` command requires at least one argument, which is the \"zkey\" string. This is the private key being imported into the wallet. There are also two optional arguments: \"rescan\" and \"startHeight\". \"rescan\" determines whether to rescan the wallet for transactions, and \"startHeight\" specifies the block height to start the rescan from.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the possible values for the \"rescan\" argument in the `z_importkey` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"rescan\" argument in the `z_importkey` command can take three possible values: \"yes\", \"no\", or \"whenkeyisnew\". \"yes\" will rescan the entire wallet, \"no\" will not rescan the wallet, and \"whenkeyisnew\" will rescan the wallet only if the key is new.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the \"startHeight\" argument in the `z_importkey` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"startHeight\" argument in the `z_importkey` command specifies the block height to start the rescan from. This can be useful if you want to limit the scope of the rescan or if you want to resume a previously interrupted rescan.\n\n**User:**\nHow long can the `z_importkey` command take to complete?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_importkey` command can take minutes to complete if the \"rescan\" argument is set to \"yes\" or \"whenkeyisnew\", as it needs to scan the entire blockchain or a large portion of it. So, be prepared to wait a bit if you choose to rescan.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I import a zkey using the `z_importkey` command with a partial rescan?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can import a zkey with a partial rescan by specifying the \"whenkeyisnew\" value for the \"rescan\" argument and providing a block height for the \"startHeight\" argument. For example: `verus z_importkey \"mykey\" whenkeyisnew 30000`. This way, you can limit the scope of the rescan and make it faster.",
