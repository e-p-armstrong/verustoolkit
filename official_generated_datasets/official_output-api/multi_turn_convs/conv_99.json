    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help you with any Verus-related questions you might have. How can I assist you today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand the `signrawtransaction` command in Verus. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `signrawtransaction` command is used to sign inputs for a raw transaction (serialized, hex-encoded). It allows you to sign a transaction with specific private keys and specify the previous transaction outputs that this transaction depends on. Do you have any other questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what are the required arguments for the `signrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `signrawtransaction` command requires at least one argument, which is the \"hexstring\" - the transaction hex string. Do you know what that means?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I think so. What about the \"prevtxs\" argument? What's that for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"prevtxs\" argument is an optional array of previous transaction outputs that this transaction depends on but may not yet be in the block chain. This allows you to specify the previous transactions that are required for this transaction to be valid.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What about the \"privatekeys\" argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"privatekeys\" argument is an optional array of base58-encoded private keys that, if given, will be the only keys used to sign the transaction. This allows you to specify the specific private keys to use for signing the transaction.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about the \"sighashtype\" argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"sighashtype\" argument is an optional string that specifies the signature hash type to use when signing the transaction. It can be one of the following values: \"ALL\", \"NONE\", \"SINGLE\", \"ALL|ANYONECANPAY\", \"NONE|ANYONECANPAY\", or \"SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY\".\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand. One last question: what's the purpose of the \"branchid\" argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"branchid\" argument is an optional string that specifies the hex representation of the consensus branch id to sign with. This can be used to force signing with consensus rules that are ahead of the node's current height. I hope that helps clarify things!",
