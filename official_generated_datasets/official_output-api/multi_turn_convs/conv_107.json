    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the `listidentities` command in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listidentities` command is used to list all identities that are associated with your Verus wallet. It can be used to retrieve a list of identities for which you have spending authority, signing authority, or are simply watching.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. Are there any optional arguments I can use with the `listidentities` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are! The `listidentities` command has three optional arguments: `includecanspend`, `includecansign`, and `includewatchonly`.\n\n* `includecanspend` (default=true) includes identities for which you have spending authority.\n* `includecansign` (default=true) includes identities for which you have signing authority but not spending authority.\n* `includewatchonly` (default=false) includes identities that you are watching but do not have spending or signing authority for.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `listidentities` command to list all identities associated with my Verus wallet, including those I can spend, sign, and watch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `listidentities` command with the following syntax:\n\n```\nverus listidentities true true true\n```\n\nThis will list all identities associated with your Verus wallet, including those you can spend, sign, and watch.",
