    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to assist you with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with the Verus CLI, and I came across the `getsnapshot` command. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getsnapshot` command returns a snapshot of (address, amount) pairs at the current block height. It requires the address index to be enabled. Would you like to know more about how to use it or what arguments it takes?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that would be great! What arguments can be passed to the `getsnapshot` command, and what do they do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getsnapshot` command can take an optional argument \"top\" (a number) which specifies the number of addresses to return, effectively giving the top N richlist. For example, you can use it to get the top 1000 addresses by amount.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful! What information is returned by the `getsnapshot` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getsnapshot` command returns a JSON object with the following information:\n\n1. An array of objects, each containing an address and its corresponding amount.\n2. The total amount in the snapshot.\n3. The average amount in each address.\n4. The total number of UTXOs in the snapshot.\n5. The total number of addresses in the snapshot.\n6. The block height at which the snapshot began.\n7. The block height at which the snapshot finished.\n8. The Unix epoch time at which the snapshot started.\n9. The Unix epoch time at which the snapshot finished.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `getsnapshot` command with a specific number of addresses to return?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getsnapshot` command with a specific number of addresses to return by passing the \"top\" argument, like this:\n\n```\nverus getsnapshot 1000\n```\n\nThis will return a snapshot with the top 1000 addresses by amount. Let me know if you have any more questions about using `getsnapshot`!",
