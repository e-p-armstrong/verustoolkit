    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand the `z_viewtransaction` command in Verus. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_viewtransaction` command is used to retrieve detailed shielded information about an in-wallet transaction, specified by its transaction ID (`txid`). It's a powerful tool for exploring the inner workings of your transactions. Do you have a specific transaction you're interested in exploring?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I do. What information can I expect to see when I run the `z_viewtransaction` command with a specific transaction ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you run the `z_viewtransaction` command with a specific transaction ID, you can expect to see a JSON object containing detailed information about the transaction. This information includes the transaction ID (`txid`), an array of \"spends\" objects, and an array of \"outputs\" objects. The \"spends\" objects will contain information about each spend in the transaction, such as the type of address, indices of the JSDescription and spend, previous transaction ID, and the value and zatoshis amount. The \"outputs\" objects will contain information about each output in the transaction, such as the type of address, indices of the JSDescription and output, Verus private address, whether the output is recovered, value and zatoshis amount, memo field, and memo string.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a lot of information. I'm a bit confused about the `value` and `valueZat` fields. What's the difference between them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `value` field represents the amount in VRSC (Verus coins), while the `valueZat` field represents the amount in zatoshis, which is a smaller unit of Verus coins (1 VRSC = 100,000,000 zatoshis). Think of it like dollars and cents - `value` is like the dollar amount, and `valueZat` is like the cents amount.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the `memo` and `memoStr` fields? What's their purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `memo` field contains a hexadecimal string representation of the memo field, which is a field in the transaction that can contain arbitrary data. The `memoStr` field is only returned if the memo field contains valid UTF-8 text, and it represents the memo field as a human-readable string. So, if someone included a message or note with the transaction, you'd be able to see it in the `memoStr` field.",
