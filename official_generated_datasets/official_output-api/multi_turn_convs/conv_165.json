    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `listunspent` command in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listunspent` command returns an array of unspent transaction outputs with between `minconf` and `maxconf` (inclusive) confirmations. It can be used to filter unspent transaction outputs by minimum and maximum confirmations, and optionally by specific addresses.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps. What are the arguments for the `listunspent` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listunspent` command takes four arguments:\n\n1. `minconf` (numeric, optional, default=1): The minimum confirmations to filter.\n2. `maxconf` (numeric, optional, default=9999999): The maximum confirmations to filter.\n3. `\"addresses\"` (string): A JSON array of VRSC addresses to filter.\n4. `includeshared` (bool, optional, default=false): Include outputs that can also be spent by others.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does the result returned by the `listunspent` command look like?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `listunspent` command is an array of JSON objects, each of which contains the following information:\n\n* `txid` (string): The transaction ID.\n* `vout` (numeric): The vout value.\n* `generated` (boolean): True if the txout is a coinbase transaction output.\n* `address` (string): The VRSC address.\n* `account` (string): The associated account, or \"\" for the default account (DEPRECATED).\n* `scriptPubKey` (string): The script key.\n* `amount` (numeric): The transaction amount in VRSC.\n* `confirmations` (numeric): The number of confirmations.\n* `redeemScript` (string): The redeemScript if scriptPubKey is P2SH.\n* `spendable` (bool): Whether we have the private keys to spend this output.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `listunspent` command to filter unspent transaction outputs by specific addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `listunspent` command to filter unspent transaction outputs by specific addresses by providing a JSON array of addresses as the third argument. For example:\n```\nverus listunspent 6 9999999 \"[\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\",\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\"]\"\n```\nThis command will return an array of unspent transaction outputs with between 6 and 9999999 confirmations, filtered to only include outputs paid to the specified addresses.",
