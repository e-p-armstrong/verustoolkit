    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the command to merge and send funds, but I'm not sure what arguments I need to provide. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required arguments for the command to merge and send funds are:\n\n1. `fromaddresses`: a JSON array of addresses from which to merge and send funds.\n2. `toaddress`: a string representing the t-addr or zaddr to send the funds to.\n\nThese two arguments are required to specify the source and destination of the funds. Do you have any other questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! I noticed that there are some special strings that can be used in the `fromaddresses` array. What are they, and what do they represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe special strings that can be used in the `fromaddresses` array are:\n\n* `\"ANY_TADDR\"`: merge UTXOs from any t-addrs belonging to the wallet.\n* `\"ANY_SPROUT\"`: merge notes from any Sprout zaddrs belonging to the wallet.\n* `\"ANY_SAPLING\"`: merge notes from any Sapling zaddrs belonging to the wallet.\n\nThese special strings allow you to merge funds from all addresses of a specific type belonging to the wallet. Do you have any other questions about these special strings?\n\n**User:**\nCan I use a combination of addresses and special strings in the `fromaddresses` array, and are there any limitations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use a combination of addresses and special strings in the `fromaddresses` array. However, there is a limitation: you cannot send funds from both Sprout and Sapling addresses simultaneously. If a special string is given, any given addresses of that type will be counted as duplicates and cause an error.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the `fee` argument, and what is its default value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `fee` argument is used to specify the fee amount to attach to this transaction. Its default value is 0.0001.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the `transparent_limit` and `shielded_limit` arguments used for, and what are their default values?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `transparent_limit` argument is used to set a limit on the maximum number of UTXOs to merge, with a default value of 50. The `shielded_limit` argument is used to set a limit on the maximum number of notes to merge, with a default value of 20 for Sprout notes and 200 for Sapling notes.",
