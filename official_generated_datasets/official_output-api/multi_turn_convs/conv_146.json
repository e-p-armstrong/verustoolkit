    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with the Verus wallet commands, and I'm not entirely sure what the `listopenoffers` command does. Can you explain its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listopenoffers` command is used to show outstanding offers in the wallet. It's a handy tool for keeping track of your open offers. Do you have any questions about how to use it or what kind of information it returns?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was wondering what optional arguments it has.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listopenoffers` command has two optional arguments: `unexpired` and `expired`. Both of these arguments are boolean values and default to `true`. These arguments allow you to filter the results of the command based on the expiration status of the offers.\n\n**User:**\nSo, what does the `unexpired` argument do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf `unexpired` is set to `true` (which is the default), the `listopenoffers` command will list those offers in the wallet which are not expired. This can be useful if you only want to see the offers that are still active.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about the `expired` argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf `expired` is set to `true` (which is the default), the `listopenoffers` command will list those offers in the wallet which are expired. This can be useful if you want to see a list of offers that are no longer active.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, what's the result of running the `listopenoffers` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of running the `listopenoffers` command is a list of all open offers in the wallet, including both unexpired and expired offers. By default, it will show you all offers, but you can use the `unexpired` and `expired` arguments to filter the results.",
