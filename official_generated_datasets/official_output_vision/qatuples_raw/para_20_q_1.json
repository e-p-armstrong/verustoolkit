    "How does the Verus wallet enable voters to earn rewards while participating in polls, and what are the rewards paid in?",
    "The Verus wallet allows voters to validate blocks through proof-of-stake, which enables them to earn rewards. These rewards are paid in Virtue for intrinsic polls, or from outputs of the payment transaction that instantiated the poll.",
    "Using autochains, Verus will dynamically create parallel voting chains on demand for each\npoll in its ecosystem. This creates improved, isolated security and allows for scaling in a\nvirtually unlimited manner.\nThe Verus wallet, which will be used for voting, will also have the ability to validate blocks\nthrough proof-of-stake, blocks which, when enabled, will allow voters who are validating the\nelection to earn rewards. These rewards will either be paid in Virtue for intrinsic polls, when\navailable, or from outputs of the payment transaction that instantiated the poll. When a\npoll is complete, results are posted back to the main Verus chain. The chain used to run it\ncan then be archived or deleted, and it is typically abandoned.\n3.3.3\n\nPoll Content and Distributed Hash Tables\n\nWhile blockchains make excellent databases for permanent, non-repudiable records and public key management, they are not the best solution for storing large amounts of data, due\nto their massive duplication across the distributed network. Instead, a better model for distributed storage would look something like the Interplanetary File System, or IPFS, which\nis a peer-to-peer file system based on the Kademlia [18]19 protocol in an implementation\nthat currently works well enough to use as storage for create/read/delete operations using\nhash commitments on the Verus blockchain to represent and index content.\nWhile we are evaluating the IPFS, we are also looking at other distributed hash table\nsolutions, such as Open DHT [26]. A key requirement for the Verus network is that mobile\ndevices be able to participate in its operation. Open DHT is an efficient C++ library intended\nfor use with small devices. IPFS does not yet seem to have much support for mobile at this\ntime, though it does have a Javascript library that can be used from the browser or mobile\napcancations [24].\nUntil IPFS is supplanted with an",
