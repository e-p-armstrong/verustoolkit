    "What is the overall approach of the Verus project in terms of adapting to unexpected opportunities or obstacles?",
    "The Verus project takes a flexible approach to unexpected opportunities or obstacles, by taking two steps to the right or left, and then proceeding forward. This allows the project to adapt and evolve in response to changing circumstances.",
    "unexpected opportunity or obstacle, take two steps to the right or left, and only then proceed\nforward.\nFor the purpose of this whitepaper, we will discuss four phases of the Verus vision. We do\nnot see these four phases as a completion of the vision as much as four phases of an ongoing\nmission to advance Verus and its contribution to society that we can currently express. From\nits inception and throughout the project, the Verus chain will serve as our fungible value\nchain, and use of Verus tokens on this chain will be the core value around which we continue\nto develop the Verus vision.\nThe first Verus chain, which is already available at the time of this white paper\u2019s release,\nincludes zk-SNARKs for privacy, both transparent and private addresses, a brand new CPUmineable hash algorithm for proof of work, a brand new proof of stake algorithm, and a\nunique emission schedule among fair launch cryptocurrency projects. Each phase of our\nproject\u2019s development will introduce capabilities and experiences that provide independent\nvalue on their own, further leverage Verus Coin to power operation, and create a foundation\nupon which to build the next phase.\n\nWe intend and hope for the Verus project to become a worldwide, inclusive community\neffort, which welcomes and rewards those who contribute. Although we articulate these first\nfour phases here, we see these phases as just the beginning, and we hope you will join us by\nparticipating in and contributing to the Verus project to make our world a better place.\n20\n\n4.1\n\nPhase I \u2013 Mainnet \u2013 50/50 PoW/PoS \u2013 Time Locks \u2013 Fair\nLaunch\n\nIn phase one, the Verus main network began with a slow start and 15 minutes advance notice\nat 7:15am GMT, Monday, May 21st, 2018.\nThe Verus network began emitting first 0 block reward, rising linearly each block over\nthe course of 7 days until block 10080 to its peak of 384 coins per block.
