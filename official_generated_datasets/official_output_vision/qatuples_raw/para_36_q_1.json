    "How was the Verus phase one release structured, and what was the team's plan for their mined and staked earnings?",
    "The Verus phase one release was pre-announced on Bitcointalk with zero premine, and team members mined and staked along with everyone else to generate coins. The team intended to donate most of their mined and staked earnings to a community Verus foundation, along with other donating community members, to support the ongoing growth and project development by core developers and the community for years to come.",
    "21To ensure that such a solution if developed, remains open, jl777, lead developer of the\nKomodo Platform, has offered a 1 Bitcoin bounty to any developer who can make and\npublish in an open manner, a GPU miner for the VerusHash algorithm that can significantly\noutperform the current CPU miner. In order to win the bounty, the source code for the\nminer must be available under open source licensing. To be eligible for the bounty, any\nimplementation must be able to perform 5x better than a modern, high thread-count, high\nclock-rate CPU on a GPU costing under $1000. By bringing up the Verus network this way,\nwe established an immediate, baseline set of functionality, above which we can build out\nour project and community around a functional coin and project, as we stay in sync with\nadvancements in the underlying Komodo platform.\nVerus phase one release was pre-announced on Bitcointalk [28] with zero premine, and\nteam members mined and staked along with everyone else to generate coins. In addition to\ncoins mined by individual team members for their own benefit, the Verus developers intend\nto donate most of their mined and staked earnings to a community Verus foundation along\nwith other donating community members who will join us, in order to support the ongoing\ngrowth and project development by core developers and the community for years to come.4.2Phase Two \u2013 Autochains, Polls, Verus MobileAs soon as we completed phase one, we entered phase two, which includes release of this\nwhite paper, activation of the community through donations of some of our mined coins,\nand a push to finish planning for, development and release of mobile support, autochain\ncapability, and the ability to setup, and then easily run CVT polls at scale.4.3Phase Three \u2013 Identity, and Proof of Virtue",
