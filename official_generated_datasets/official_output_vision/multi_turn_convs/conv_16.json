    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus's vision for voting and polls. What types of voting does Verus plan to support in its early phases?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the early phases, Verus plans to focus on supporting multiple choice and weighted multiple choice voting.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also seen mention of different types of polls in Verus's taxonomy. What are they?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus defines the following types of polls: polls to classify, polls to select, polls to rank, and polls to rate. These different types of polls will allow for a wide range of use cases and applications.\n\n**User:**\nWhat features may each type of Verus poll support?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach type of Verus poll may support confidential or public voting, live or delayed poll results, online or offline vote authorization, and lottery selected vote authorization. This flexibility will enable a wide range of use cases and ensure the integrity of the voting process.\n\n**User:**\nWhen can we expect to see expanded support for voting and poll types in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExpanding support for voting and poll types will be a higher priority during or after the completion of the fourth phase of Verus development. The team is focused on building a solid foundation before expanding the feature set.\n\n**User:**\nWhat types of voting models will Verus initially provide solutions for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus will initially provide solutions for weighted and unweighted selection voting, which fits well for both political and opinion polls as well as content classification and ID verification. This will provide a solid foundation for more advanced voting models in the future.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about Verus or its vision for voting and polls!",
