    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI was thinking about the implications of Verus's design, and I had a question. What is the potential downside of Verus's design to provide uncensored tools to people across the world?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! The potential downside is that it may also allow the darker aspects of human nature to manifest, enabling harmful or undesirable content to be shared on the network. This is a concern that Verus is aware of and is actively working to address.\n\n**User:**\nI see. That makes sense. How does Verus plan to address the issue of undesirable content on its network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus plans to use its poll system to recognize, rate, and classify content on its network, enabling participants to earn rewards for their efforts while allowing for selective filtering of content based on value judgments and classification of honest populations. This way, the community itself can help regulate the type of content that is shared on the network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What is the initial expected application of Verus's content classification capability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe initial expected application is to classify non-intrinsic polls themselves, as well as relatively simple tasks such as identifying toxic comments, hate speech, or categories of information. This will help lay the foundation for a more comprehensive content classification system in the future.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. How does Verus envision its content classification system to work in the long run?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus envisions its content classification system to enable people to earn rewards by classifying content more accurately than machine learning systems, while also allowing the best machine learning algorithms to follow and generalize the classification at scale. This hybrid approach will help ensure that the system is both accurate and efficient.",
