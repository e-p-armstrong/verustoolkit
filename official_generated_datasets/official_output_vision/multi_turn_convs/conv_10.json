    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the purpose of the intrinsic polls that will be available on the Verus network once Virtue is activated.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe intrinsic polls on the Verus network are used to classify and rate content across Verus applications, enabling a rating system rather than censorship. This allows each voter to set preferences for the ratings of polls they may wish to see. It's an innovative way to ensure that users have control over the content they see, while still promoting a healthy and diverse ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. How do identities with Virtue participate in the intrinsic polls, and what's the benefit of doing so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIdentities with Virtue can participate in the intrinsic polls based on a statistical lottery and weighted by their actual measure of Virtue. By participating in these polls, they help the system classify and rate content, and in return, they can set preferences for the ratings of polls they may wish to see. It's a way for users to contribute to the ecosystem and shape the content they see, while also benefiting from a more personalized experience.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What about the miners who provision autochains for intrinsic polls on the Verus network? Do they get any rewards?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMiners who provision autochains for intrinsic polls on the Verus network receive the same rewards as miners setting up autochains for commissioned polls. It's a way to incentivize miners to support the ecosystem and ensure the smooth operation of the intrinsic polls.\n\n**User:**\nWhere does the content for the intrinsic polls come from, and how is it used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe content for the intrinsic polls is taken from other polls and is used to classify and rate those polls for easier discoverability and to improve the user experience of poll services. It's a way to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where users can easily find and engage with the content that matters most to them.",
