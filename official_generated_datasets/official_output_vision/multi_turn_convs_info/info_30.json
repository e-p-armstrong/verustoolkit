            "How do identities work in the Verus network, and what are their benefits?",
            "In the Verus network, each identity has its own unique address. Unless the owner reveals information linking two or more identities, it is cryptographically hard (virtually impossible) to correlate one identity to another. However, the owner of an identity can still cryptographically verify statements made about identities under their control, attesting to identity properties (such as passport, age, height, citizenship, photo, etc.) as strongly as possible with today's digital technology.",
