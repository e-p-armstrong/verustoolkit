            "The key benefit of using Verus identities is that each identity has its own unique address, and it is cryptographically hard (virtually impossible) to correlate one identity to another, unless the owner reveals information to link them.",

Unless its owner reveals information\nto link two or more identities, it is cryptographically hard \u2013 meaning virtually impossible\n\u2013 to correlate one identity to another.
