    "What are the three fundamental pillars of the Verus Project's long-term vision for a better society through public blockchain services?",
    "The three fundamental pillars of the Verus Project's long-term vision are:\n\n1. Extreme transaction throughput and scalable decentralized applications with autochains, providing public blockchains as a service (PBaaS).\n2. Selectively strong, private identity.\n3. Open application support with a foundation of polls, voting, and lottery selection services.\n\nThese pillars work together to create a virtuous circle, where the correct operation of each pillar strengthens the others.",
    "The longer term Verus Project vision of a better society through public blockchain services\nrelies upon three fundamental pillars \u2013where the correct operation of each strengthens the\nothers in the form of a virtuous circle.\nThese pillars are:\n1. Extreme transaction throughput and scalable decentralized applications with autochains,\nwhich provide public blockchains as a service (PBaaS)\n2. Selectively strong, private identity, and\n3. Open application support with a foundation of polls, voting, and lottery selection\nservices.\nEach of these pillars will help us process human knowledge, understanding, and/or opinion on any content or topic. Together, they will enable direct querying \u2013 with confidential\nand truthful \u2013 answers across an entire population. It will create a secure, public platform\nthat respects privacy, and can potentially serve as the foundation of a more respectful society.\nIt is also important to know about the the concept of Verus Virtue when reading further\nin this document. The best way to think about Virtue for the purposes of this document\nis as a separate currency that can be earned, but not purchased or sold, and is part of the\n6evolution of the Verus proof-of-stake algorithm, slated for later phases of the Verus project.\nProof of Virtue is a technology that will be described in much greater detail and implemented\nin later phases of the Verus project.3.1Autochains",
