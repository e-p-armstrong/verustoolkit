    "What happens when my wallet detects a lag in Verus?",
    "When your wallet detects a lag in Verus, it immediately stops attempting to mine or stake and devotes maximum resources to catching up. This ensures that mining and staking occur on a viable tip of the chain, rather than contributing to further lag.",
    "This release should make a huge difference in global network synchronization, mining, and staking, which should provide a strong foundation as the network grows. In addition, it has significant efficiency improvements for both mining and staking. Here is a rundown of the improvements in this version: New in both command line and GUI: 1. Reconfigured connection ratios, better seed node discovery built in. Default outgoing connections now 4, default incoming for full node 384. If your machine can handle it, you can help the network and broadcast your stakes more quickly to increase the number of connections in your VRSC.conf with \"maxconnections=n\", where n is the number you wish to use. 2. Improved lag detection. If your wallet detects a lag, it immediately stops attempting to mine or stake and devotes maximum resources to catching up. Rather than continuing to mine or stake, which may contribute to further lag, this action ensures mining and staking occurs on a viable tip of the chain. 3. Improved staking efficiency. This version raises the default priority of the staking thread, ensuring that the staking process is fast and efficient, even in cases where it would have also lagged with mining or other machine load. 4. All updates and improvements from Komodo Platform as of 1.5 weeks ago have been merged. Preparing for unlocked era. First release with verus-cli Linux, Mac and Windows variants built and distributed for the VerusCoin Launch.",
