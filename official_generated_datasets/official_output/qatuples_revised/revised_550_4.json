    "What is the purpose of the wallet backup script, and how often can it be run?",
    "The script is designed to create a daily backup of the wallet.dat file in the cloud. It can be run manually or scheduled to run daily using crontab.",
    "# How to make a cloud daily backup of wallet.dat? Note: I use Google Cloud for my staking wallet and backups but the script works regardless of what you use; if you have timelocked coins, you will have to keep your wallet.dat file secure for a long, long time: it's crucial to maintain secure the staking instance as well as the storage.. ### Important General Information `VRSC Wallet and Data location` on Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC` ## Procedure: If you use GCloud: * create a new directory where we'll upload the backups (ie: mkdir /home/user/backup) * create a storage bucket via GCloud console (ie bucket_verus) * mount the bucket on your local machine (syntax is: gcsfuse ; ie gcsfuse bucket_verus /home/user/backup) The script can be crontab scheduled to run daily or you can run it manually; if you schedule it, you have to hardcode the encryption passphrase; otherwise you can input it manually each time. You will have to install gnupg2 to encrypt (`sudo apt-get install gnupg2 gnupg-agent`). As always: be sure to fully understand what the script does and why I left some echos to demonstration/test purposes, you can sefely remove all of them. ```bash #!/bin/bash # Customize the SOURCE and the DEST folders SOURCE_FOLDER=/home/XXXXX/.komodo/VRSC/ DEST_FOLDER=/home/XXXX/backup/ BCK_DATE=date +%Y-%m-%d.%H:%M SOURCE_FILE=wallet.dat DEST_FILE=$SOURCEFILE\"\"$BCK_DATE ENCRYPT_EXT=\".gpg\" # all echo are for test purposes, feel free to delete them echo check variable echo SOURCE - $SOURCE_FOLDER echo SOURCE_FILE - $SOURCE_FILE echo DEST FILE - $DEST_FILE echo DEST - $DEST_FOLDER echo TO_BE_DEL - $DEST_FOLDER$SOURCE_FILE sleep 1 cp $SOURCE_FOLDER$SOURCE_FILE $DEST_FOLDER$DEST_FILE sleep 1 # Customize the passphrase!! gpg2 --batch --yes -c --cipher-algo AES256 --passphrase=\"XXXXXX\" $DEST_FOLDER$DEST_FILE sleep 1 rm $DEST_FOLDER$DEST_FILE # Keep only last 6 days - BE SURE to fully understand how it works, as every \"rm\" command! find $DEST_FOLDER/wallet* -type f -mtime +6 -exec rm {} ; ``` (submitted by @TexWiller) Note: last revision date 2020-02-26.",
