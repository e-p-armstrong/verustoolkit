    "What are some key features of the Verus public testnet, and how does it enable users to create new blockchains and currencies?",
    "The Verus public testnet enables anyone to create new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. It allows for easy sending of currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies, with fully decentralized conversions that require a standard protocol fee of 0.01% which goes to miners and stakers of the network.",

THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED FOR USE ON MAINNET.***The Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. Sending currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies is as easy as sending a cryptocurrency in less advanced systems today, except that the new Verus protocol enables you to include another blockchain as part of your destination and convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price along the way. All conversions are fully decentralized, require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network, and calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.",
