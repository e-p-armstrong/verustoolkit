    "Some of the additional capabilities of Verus include:\n\n* On-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs\n* On-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming\n* On-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles",
    "This version also prevents the wallet from crediting transactions that can be constructed to make a burn look like a spendable output, ensuring that unspendable funds are not added to a wallet or address balance. @Alrighttt, who has been focusing on Verus security testing, reported a way that someone might create such an output, and we appreciate that it is before we have ever seen such transactions on the public or test networks. Thanks @Alrighttt for the report and discretion that helps keep them off the network(s) altogether! We recommend that everyone update as soon as possible to version 0.9.9-5 or later.We are working towards the mainnet PBaaS upgrade version 1.0.0, but we cannot put a specific date beyond \ud83d\udd1c on its release.### What\u2019s New for TestNet This release fixes hopefully the last remaining issue that was causing testnet users to experience sync issues on PBaaS chains.There are no other significant changes.### Additional Verus Capabilities - On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs - On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming - On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.#### Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.",
