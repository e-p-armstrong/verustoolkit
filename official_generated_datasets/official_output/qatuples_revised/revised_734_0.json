    "What are VerusIDs, and how do they differ from other blockchain ID implementations?",
    "VerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. VerusIDs provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications, including quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network.",

This update is the latest for the upgraded Verus mainnet.This release fixes an issue that does not generally affect the Verus network, but can corrupt individual wallets in the case of a specific type of reorg occurrence that is relatively rare, but can happen. We STRONGLY RECOMMEND that all users upgrade to version 0.6.0-6 asap.This release includes activation support for VerusID, and relative adjustment to the CPU and FPGA-equalizing VerusHash 2.1 Algorithm# Verus ID VerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. VerusIDs provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, VerusID provides:### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.",
