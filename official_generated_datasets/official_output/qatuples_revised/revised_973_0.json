    "What is the purpose of the `idreferrallevels` property when defining a chain?",
    "The `idreferrallevels` property specifies how many levels ID referrals go back in reward. This means that the property determines the depth of the referral reward structure, where users can earn rewards for referring others to the chain, and those referred users can also earn rewards for referring others, and so on.",
