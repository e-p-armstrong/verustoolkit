    "What happens to the UTXOs selected for merging when using `z_mergetoaddress`?",
    "The UTXOs selected for merging will be locked. If there is an error, they will be unlocked. You can use the RPC call `listlockunspent` to return a list of locked UTXOs.",
    "### `z_mergetoaddress [\"fromaddress\", ... ] \"toaddress\" ( fee ) ( transparent_limit ) ( shielded_limit ) ( memo )` WARNING: z_mergetoaddress is disabled. To enable it, restart verusd with the `-experimentalfeatures` and `-zmergetoaddress` commandline options, or add these two lines to the `VRSC.conf` file: ``` experimentalfeatures=1 zmergetoaddress=1 ``` Merge multiple UTXOs and notes into a single UTXO or note. Protected coinbase UTXOs are ignored, use `z_shieldcoinbase` to combine those into a single note.This is an asynchronous operation, and UTXOs selected for merging will be locked. If there is an error, they are unlocked. The RPC call `listlockunspent` can be used to return a list of locked UTXOs.The number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging can be limited by the caller. If the transparent limit parameter is set to zero, and Overwinter is not yet active, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option will determine the number of UTXOs. After Overwinter has activated `-mempooltxinputlimit` is ignored and having a transparent input limit of zero will mean limit the number of UTXOs based on the size of the transaction. Any limit is constrained by the consensus rule defining a maximum transaction size of 100000 bytes before Sapling, and 2000000 bytes once Sapling activates.",
