    "How do I start the miner, and what parameters need to be specified?",
    "To start the miner, you need to run the following command:\n```\n./ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.donator -p x\n```\nYou need to specify the algorithm (`-a verus`), the pool URL (`-o stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999`), your wallet address (`-u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.donator`), and the password (`-p x`).",
    "# Compile Monkins Verus enhanced CCMiner for various hardware Read it completely before using. ## Important General Information This guide is aimed towards Debian based Linux distributions. If you are using a different kind of distribution (eg RPM-based, like CentOS) you will need to install the dependancies using a procedure that fits your specific distribution. There are 3 active branches in ccminer github repo:  `ARM`       (for 64bit ARM chips with AES intrinsic)  `Verus2.2`    (standard x86-64 pc's)  `Verus2.2gpu`   (GPUs) Note: Replace `ARM` in the `git clone` line below with the branchname above you want to use. ## Procedure: Install dependencies (specific for Debian-based distributions): ```bash sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libjansson-dev automake autotools-dev build-essential git ``` For GPU-miner compilation additional sources are required (Not needed for CPU or ARM): ```bash wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.2/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.2.89_440.33.01_linux.run sudo sh cuda_10.2.89_440.33.01_linux.run ``` Download the source and compile: ```bash git clone --single-branch -b ARM https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer.git cd ccminer chmod +x build.sh chmod +x configure.sh chmod +x autogen.sh ./build.sh ``` And finally starting the miner (Change pool, address & workername to your own liking): ```bash ./ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.donator -p x ``` Info from @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining.
