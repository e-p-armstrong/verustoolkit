    "How do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on both testnet and mainnet?",
    "To sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\n2. Take the raw hex transaction data and sign it with each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs using:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n3. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```",
