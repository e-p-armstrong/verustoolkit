    "How has the RC1 cross-chain witness and notarization protocol been enhanced in RC2?",
    "In RC2, any notarization to be confirmed must be first posted publicly to allow for potential to prove invalidity, and then later confirmed. This is an enhancement over the prior protocol, where a witnessed notarization could be posted to a chain and accepted when first seen, which had an attack vector of even stolen notary/witness keys combined.",
    " currency is called tokenized ID control and can be treated like a super NFT over all copies of the source ID on all chains that were exported to other chains after the currency was created. Once the Ethereum contracts are upgraded with this capability, *.veth or IDs with root names on the Verus blockchain can be used to create Ethereum NFT mapped currencies, which enable a Cryptopunk, Ethrock, or whatever other NFT you\u2019d like to not only be sent to Verus, held on a revocable/recoverable ID, and also permanently upleveled with ID powers, being cryptographically bound as an ID\u2019s permanent control token that can be sent to any chain or to Ethereum and back.  This unique Verus-only technology and VerusIDs enable new models of complex, atomic and fully decentralized transactions. By using exported IDs across any number of networks and an ID control token, ownership of an unlimited array of assets across an unlimited number of networks can for the first time ever, have ownership transferred in one transaction. - While NFT mapped tokens are supported on the RC2 PBaaS protocol, they have not yet been implemented in the Ethereum contracts. You will not be able to send NFTs from Ethereum to Verus or PBaaS chains until that work is complete, which we do not expect to take a great deal of time. - Liquidity currencies now support new methods to burn currency with the following results:  - `burnweight` - available to centralized currencies only and enables burning the primary currency to raise the reserve ratio weights of all reserves.  - `burn` for reserve currencies - in prior releases, burn was only used for primary currencies and would reduce the supply of a currency relative to its reserves, increasing the on-chain value of the primary currency. In v0.9.4, you can now also \u201cburn\u201d reserve currencies in a liquidity basket currency, which simply donates that amount of reserve into the currency\u2019s reserves without taking any new supply in exchange. This is available to decentralized or centralized currencies.- Bridgekeeper is now available for permissionless bridge notarization and selectable in the GUI on the mining page. For CLI, we will make a Node application available for testing in the next few days. - RC1 cross-chain witness and notarization protocol enhanced in RC2 as follows:  - In RC2, any notarization to be confirmed must be first posted publicly to allow for potential to prove invalidity, and then later confirmed. In the prior protocol, a witnessed notarization could be posted to a chain and accepted when first seen. Upon analysis and discussion with @allbits and others, we realized that the attack vector of even stolen notary/witness keys combined ",
