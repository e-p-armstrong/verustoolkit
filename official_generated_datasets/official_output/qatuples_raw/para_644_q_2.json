    "What is VerusID, and what benefits does it offer?",
    "VerusID is a feature of the Verus testnet that enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. This means that users have complete control over their identities, can revoke and recover them as needed, and can use them to manage funds and assets.",
