    "How can I use the `listsinceblock` command to retrieve transactions from a specific block hash?",
    "You can use the `listsinceblock` command by specifying the block hash as an argument, followed by the number of transactions to retrieve. For example:\n```\nverus listsinceblock \"000000000000000bacf66f7497b7dc45ef753ee9a7d38571037cdb1a57f663ad\" 6\n```\nThis command will retrieve the 6 most recent transactions starting from the block with the specified hash.",
    "Examples: ```bash > verus listsinceblock > verus listsinceblock \"000000000000000bacf66f7497b7dc45ef753ee9a7d38571037cdb1a57f663ad\" 6 > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"listsinceblock\", \"params\": [\"000000000000000bacf66f7497b7dc45ef753ee9a7d38571037cdb1a57f663ad\", 6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/ ```### `listtransactions ( \"account\" count from includeWatchonly)` Returns up to 'count' most recent transactions skipping the first 'from' transactions for account 'account'.#### Arguments: 1. \"account\"  (string, optional) DEPRECATED.
