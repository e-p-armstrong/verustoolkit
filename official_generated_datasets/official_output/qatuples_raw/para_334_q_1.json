    "How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?",
    "To verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `./verus verifyfile` or `./verus verifyhash` command to verify the signature and checksum of the download. The result will be `true` if the signature is valid.",

These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". 1) Extract downloaded archive 2) Verify signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. 3) Extract archive to desired directory #### CLI examples **Verifying file directly** ``` ./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"Ae1xJQABQSCusp3AYTcIlTUklLlDl7goo3n1773y1jIR73JtLLHFgjjwpC/tvuDcJ8hdj/voxmHU2WmTKq7LkVaTAi/EZD1V\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.9-2-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.9-2-x86_64.tar.gz\" ``` **Verifying using a checksum** ``` ./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"Ae1xJQABQSCusp3AYTcIlTUklLlDl7goo3n1773y1jIR73JtLLHFgjjwpC/tvuDcJ8hdj/voxmHU2WmTKq7LkVaTAi/EZD1V\" 51813c20a4fd94870987dec24bc41606f27bd26c29952ea12f51a8204a39ae37 ```**The result will be true if the signature is valid.** ``` true ``` ## v0.9.9-1 Announcing v0.9.9-1, MANDATORY FOR TESTNET, no mainnet changesThis release implements a fix for communication with BridgeKeeper for the Testnet Goerli Ethereum Bridge, as well as edge-case notarization improvements. We need every testnet participant to upgrade to this version as soon as possible to resume notarizations for the ETH bridge and the pbaas chains. Once enough people upgrade, the testnet upgrade can be broadcasted via oracle and we can get closer to getting pbaas on mainnet.### Additional Verus Capabilities - On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs - On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming - On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
