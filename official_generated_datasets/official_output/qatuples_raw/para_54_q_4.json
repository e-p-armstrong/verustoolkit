For example:\n- `%AppData%\\Komodo\\PIRATE` for the Pirate asset chain\n- `%AppData%\\Komodo\\OOT` for the Utrum asset chain\n- `%AppData%\\Komodo\\ZEXO` for the Zexo asset chain",
    "# Standard file location for Verus Desktop The installer for Verus-Desktop suggests a standard location to install to, depending on the choice whether you want to install it for all users or just yourself. ## Anyone who uses the computer (All Users) `%ProgramFiles%\\Verus-Desktop` ## Only me: `%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Verus-Desktop` Normally you don't need to worry about these locations, but in some instances you will be asked by community members providing support to look up a file in a folder in your Verus-Desktop installation. note: changing files in these folders or subfolders may result in a corrupt installation. Only do so when instructed by our support community members. ## Deamons The daemons are located in the `komodod`, `verusd` and `zcashd` folders that can be found in the `resources\\app\\assets\\bin\\win64\\` subfolder of your installation folder. ## Program settings Verus Desktop saves it program settings on a different folder: `%AppData%\\Verus-Desktop` The users settings are stored in `appdata\\config.json` in the program settings folder. ## Standard chain data and wallet locations #### KMD `%AppData%\\Komodo` ### Verus `%AppData%\\Komodo\\VRSC` #### Komodo asset chains Any Komodo asset chain will create a subfolder in the KMD chain data and wallet folder, which is standard named. The names will be in capitals and are identical to the **official** asset-chain name. `%AppData%\\Komodo\\<CHAIN-NAME>` Note: examples Pirate: `%AppData%\\Komodo\\PIRATE` Utrum: `%AppData%\\Komodo\\OOT` Zexo: `%AppData%\\Komodo\\ZEXO` And so on... For easy access to the binaries folders, Verus-Desktop program settings and VRSC chain folder and all binary folders, you can use the debug menu in Verus-Desktop. note: updated at 2020-12-03 by Oink.vrsc@",
