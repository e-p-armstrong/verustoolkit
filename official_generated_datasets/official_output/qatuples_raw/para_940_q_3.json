    "How do I list and display identities in my wallet on the Verus testnet?",
    "You can list identities in your wallet using the `listidentities` command, and display specific identities using the `getidentity` command.",
    "Create your commitment with the following command: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registernamecommitment Name youraddressorid referrerfriendlyname@ That will respond with something like: {  \"txid\": \"377576f8ada1acc2aeb013ddf7a9ad86756cb990d4c5fc70b5a9a0fca43d727e\",  \"namereservation\": {   \"name\": \"Name\",   \"salt\": \"7b981f0a1ff2593167ef078150d0116335a7f329f9403b0abaeca30a42d8876a\",   \"referral\": \"iSJLKp1hvn51Zg2Y6FBKjzLs9AAy7fomWN\",   \"parent\": \"\",   \"nameid\": \"iDXx9FPrAS5k2XCGss6FFmDQQMsts63uUg\"  } } ``` You then wait for the commitment to be mined into a block, then use the information returned above as follows: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registeridentity '{\"txid\":\"377576f8ada1acc2aeb013ddf7a9ad86756cb990d4c5fc70b5a9a0fca43d727e\", \"namereservation\": {   \"name\": \"Name\", \"salt\": \"7b981f0a1ff2593167ef078150d0116335a7f329f9403b0abaeca30a42d8876a\", \"referral\":\"referrerfriendlyname@\"}, \"identity\":{\"name\":\"Name\", \"primaryaddresses\":[\"RKo5u8N1sStZu81fU8kaxhoDcFcJmNEwSp\"], \"minimumsignatures\":1, \"privateaddress\":\"zs14y0aa096em2as6n4fauyumqeywz45rfpze38c39fksgtjsac9vmms7fmstcylpaalm7rseu8838\"}}' ``` As long as you have enough funds and you are registering a new identity on the blockchain, you will be able to use your new identity in place of an address as soon as the transaction created by the registration command is mined into the blockchain. You may list the identities in your wallet with the command `listidentities`, and you may display specific identities with the command `getidentity`. If you have the authority, or use identities under your control as revocation or recovery authorities for other identities, you may also revoke and recovery identities as well.## Testnet Reset The testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:** **Linux:** ``` ~/.komodo/VRSCTEST ~/.verustest ```**MacOS** ``` \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest ```**Windows** ``` \"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST \"%APPDATA%\"\\VerusTest ```**Launching the testnet:** ``` ./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST ```# Disclaimer",
