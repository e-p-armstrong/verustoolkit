    "What is the purpose of the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in Verus?",
    "The `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in Verus are used to verify the authenticity of a download by checking the signature or checksum of the file against a known good signature or checksum. This ensures that the file has not been tampered with or corrupted during download.",
    "## Verifying Downloads A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, is included for each download. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". 1) Extract downloaded archive 2) Verify signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. 3) Extract archive to desired directory ### CLI examples **Verifying file directly** ``` ./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AR1XEAABQR8XbEix6eohYN9m6BbLjcdUkCZH/NYw1/mfBq/mIT6SewPg4PvaJHsUIO8FLB8kQDpa9eKglWJN9DTfvpWlMH9Z /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.0-4-amd64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.0-4-amd64.tar.gz ``` **Verifying using a checksum** ``` ./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AR1XEAABQR8XbEix6eohYN9m6BbLjcdUkCZH/NYw1/mfBq/mIT6SewPg4PvaJHsUIO8FLB8kQDpa9eKglWJN9DTfvpWlMH9Z 3c8134361c965ab87751f817a097c1825ca61e2a521bfd1ed9382fbc44638920 ```**The result will be true if the signature is valid.** ``` true ```At block 1053660, the Verus Mainnet Protocol upgraded to the new Komodo Notary Nodes for Komodo dPoW notarization, season 4, and a number of new capabilities, as well as a change to the Verus Proof of Power staking and mining hash that is now live on Verus mainnet.Although the network is running smoothly after the upgrade, an issue was identified and resolved in this release. In addition, a couple of user features, including restoring \"-pubkey=hexpubkey\" as a parameter for redirecting staking and mining rewards are included.## The network upgrade activated the following features: - Added support for season 4 Komodo notary node operators- Coinbase shielding will no longer be required on any coinbases from the past that have not yet been shielded.- Staking will now work on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds.- A new \ufffd`sendcurrency` API for the command line provides more control when sending from and to multiple addresses or identities.- `updateidentity` will now be able to change the case of characters in the name of a VerusID in the global locale.- Revocation identity will now lose all control over an ID after revocation, including the ability to still change the revocation identity itself, which it used to retain. After revocation now, the recovery identity will have full control over the revoked ID.- Staking and hashing consensus protocol updates with VerusHash 2.2# Disclaimer",
