            "You can confirm that a block has been minted and a staking reward has been earned by looking for the following characteristics:\n\n1. The block hash has few leading zeros.\n2. The last transaction in your wallet has no fee, is from the same address that it is to, and is also the address the coinbase is to.\n3. The POS difficulty is encoded in the low 32 bits of the nonce with 96 of the next nonce bits as zero/reserved, followed by a random hash at the top half.",
