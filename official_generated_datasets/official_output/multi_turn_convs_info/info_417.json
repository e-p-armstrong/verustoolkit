            "What is the plan for preparing the PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) for mainnet activation?",
            "To prepare PBaaS for mainnet activation, a final testnet will be created, and the pre-PBaaS upgrade on the existing testnet will be extended to a future date via the oracles. This will allow for the removal of testnet history from the code before mainnet activation, making the next upgrade incompatible with today's testnet and its earlier history. This will result in a cleaner code base for both Verus and the ETH contracts.",
            "### Mainnet Changes - no protocol changes V0.9.9-3 introduces the `prunespentwallettransactions` CLI command and RPC API, providing a method for holders on testnet or mainnet of very large wallets to prune older spent transactions, which can improve performance for wallets that may be slowing down due to size. Thanks @Himu007 for the PR! There are no mainnet protocol changes in v0.9.9-3 over the prior release.### What\u2019s New for TestNet This release includes an activation that allows a major upgrade to the testnet Ethereum bridge contracts that is both not expected to be needed again on testnet and not ever needed on mainnet with the new contract upgrade model. This upgrade should clear all known issues on the bridge to Goerli, meaning any remaining bridge transactions will be delivered, and the ETH bridge should then be fully functional.### The Path for PBaaS to Mainnet This testnet has actually been through a lot already, more than we expected before mainnet, and this last experience, along with its full restoration of cross-chain and all function has been very useful and was the impetus for the Verus Oracle Notification technology. In the process of getting here, we implemented the necessary changes and fixes to get everything back on track, but we also have remnants of these events in the daemon, and on the final protocol, these are there to enable compatibility with the history of testnet, not because we need these upgrades on mainnet PBaaS. It gave us experience, increased confidence, and pushed us to develop a fast, decentralized network response capability. At the same time, it would be best for our code base, both on the Verus side and in the ETH contracts if that testnet history is removed from the code before mainnet activation. Doing so would make the next upgrade incompatible with today\u2019s testnet and its earlier history.As a result, we have decided that we will create one final testnet, but this time, we would do it a little differently than in the past. We will extend the pre-PBaaS upgrade on the existing testnet to a future date via the oracles. If you have started a chain and control the default oracle on any chain, please check the #pbaas-development channel for instructions on setting your oracle to extend the upgrade.",
