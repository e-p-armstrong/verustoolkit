            "What is a limitation of creating a currency from an ID that has an i-address as its actual name?",
            "One limitation is that you will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.",
