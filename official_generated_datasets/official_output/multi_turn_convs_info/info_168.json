            "To resolve this error, you need to shield your coinbase coins through a private address (zaddress) first. Here's a step-by-step procedure:\n\n1. Go to the \"Receive\" screen and create a new private address (starting with `zs`) if you don't already have one.\n2. Copy the new private address to your clipboard.\n3. Go to the \"Mining\" screen, select Verus, and select \"Shield Rewards\".\n4. Leave \"All unshielded funds\" as the source and paste the new zaddress into the destination.\n5. Click on \"Continue\" and wait until you have a private balance showing on the Wallet screen.\n6. Send the coins again, this time from your private address to any normal transparent receive address that you have.",
