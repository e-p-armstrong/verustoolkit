            "The two new APIs introduced in the latest release of VerusID are `getidentityhistory` and `getidentitycontent`. They provide real-time mempool access and introduce self-sovereign delete operations to identity content, making it easy for applications to index, organize, and aggregate an unlimited amount of user content referenced by an identity.",
            "5. **Expanding L1 VerusID APIs**: This release provides a major enhancement to the identity content multimap support with two new APIs, `getidentityhistory` and `getidentitycontent` that provide real-time mempool access and also introduce self-sovereign delete operations to identity content that can be used by applications, making it easy for applications to index, organize, and aggregate an unlimited amount of user content referenced by an identity and made available to the application. This is the technology we used for oracle upgrade notifications, as all of this is available at L1, making it possible to imagine future protocols that can deal smoothly with diverse community opinions worldwide, but always respect the sovereignty and decisions of all members on the network. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**6. **Introducing Restricted VerusID Staking for PBaaS Chains**: This release enables the stretch goal of restricted ID staking as an option for launching PBaaS chains. This option means that on such a PBaaS chain, only funds controlled by IDs with a parent of that PBaaS chain may stake blocks on that chain.
