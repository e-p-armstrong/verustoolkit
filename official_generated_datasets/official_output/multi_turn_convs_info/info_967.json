            "The `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI are used to verify the integrity of a file by checking its signature. The `verifyfile` command takes a file path as an argument, while the `verifyhash` command takes a file checksum as an argument. Both commands return `true` if the signature is valid, indicating that the file has not been tampered with.",
