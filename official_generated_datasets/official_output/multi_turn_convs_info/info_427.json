            "What is the purpose of the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in Verus?",
            "The `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in Verus are used to verify the authenticity of a download by checking the digital signature or checksum of the file. This ensures that the file has not been tampered with or corrupted during download, and that it comes from a trusted source.",
