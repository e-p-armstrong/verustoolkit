            "What should I do if my antivirus software flags the Verus software as a virus or PUP?",
            "If your antivirus software flags the Verus software as a virus or PUP (Potential Unwanted Program), it's likely a false positive. Verus is a mining software, and some antivirus software may flag it as a potential threat. You can review the resources provided to learn more about these false positives and why they occur. Avast and Kaspersky, in particular, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", which are warnings that you are installing mining software that could be used to exploit your PC.",
