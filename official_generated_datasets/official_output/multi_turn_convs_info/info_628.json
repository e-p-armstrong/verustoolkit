            "How do I schedule a script to run automatically at regular intervals?",
            "You can schedule a script to run automatically at regular intervals by adding it to your system's crontab. The crontab syntax is `m h dom mon dow command`, where `m` is the minute, `h` is the hour, `dom` is the day of the month, `mon` is the month, `dow` is the day of the week, and `command` is the command to run. For example, `*/5 * * * * /home/user/checkfornewblocks.sh` runs the `checkfornewblocks.sh` script every 5 minutes.",
