            "What was the issue with the liquidity basket that was recently fixed, and how does it affect the fees and conversions?",
            "The issue was that the fees, including fractional fees on an exit from a liquidity basket, were not being burned before conversions took place. This meant that the person who exited with 100MM RaceCondition only received 14 VRSC instead of 15 VRSC. The fix ensures that fees are burned before conversions, resulting in a correct fee allocation and a 15 SAT price.",
            "The fix means that all fees, including the fractional fees on an exit from a liquidity basket are burned before conversions take place, which in this case, would enable the person who exited with 100MM RaceCondition to take 15 VRSC, instead of the 14 that they did. This is because the correct fee allocation results in a 15 SAT price, which means the person who remains holding the RaceCondition bag would have only some 100s of thousands of SATs left in reserves. On the other hand, anyone could come in and reinflate the 5% currency by converting to it. This event on the network had the effect of reducing the extreme difference between supply and reserves on RaceCondition, and it will operate as a normal 5% reserve currency should when DeFi reactivates.The lesson here is that if you\u2019re interested to learn about a basket currency, pay attention to the total reserve ratio, what currencies are in it, and see that there is enough liquidity of reserves and holder distribution for the basket to make sense. Of course baskets could be memes, but they also have real function. Make sure you take a look into how a basket works and that you have a reason before putting your hard mined, staked, won, or purchased Verus in.We will need the network to upgrade to version 1.0.6 before we can re-enable DeFi and cross-chain functions, making the ETH bridge launch possible, as well as PBaaS launches and conversions.We see that someone is launching a currency called \u201cwhales\u201d, which looks like an ID registration currency that will enable registering IDs with 3 levels of referrals in a currency that simply collects registration fees, which may start quite reasonably priced and likely get more expensive over time as fees are earned in the basket. The startblock for whales is 2561900, which should happen somewhere around 6:00 UTC on Thursday. That means that if we can upgrade and activate by Tuesday before the meeting, that person would still have time for pre-launch participation by those who would like.Thanks everyone for upgrading as soon as you are able!### Additional Verus Capabilities - On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs - On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming - On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
