That means that while staking or mining, anyone who has a Sapling cheat catcher address set, may periodically find an additional shielded coinbase or two in their cheat catching address. **Earning cheat catching rewards does not new create coins, but actually takes them from cheaters, so DON\u2019T CHEAT :) !** Earning a cheat catching reward can also occur whether or not you earn a block reward and is available equally across the network to all miners and stakers, more dependent on who happens to observe the cheating fork and catches the cheater than on staking or mining power.## Version 0.4.0c also fixes the following issues reported in prior versions: - Wallet balance can get out of sync with blockchain when staking - Some non-Latin usernames cause failure to load - When used to load KMD in GUI Agama, Komodo stops accruing interest after transfer ### IF YOUR WALLET IS OUT OF SYNC, YOU CAN RESCAN TO FIX THE PROBLEM.",
