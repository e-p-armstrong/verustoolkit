    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

    What is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what are its benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is an interoperable network that
    allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. Notary
    IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific
    bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge
    mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to
    set up with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their
    internal private network.



    **QUESTION:**

    What are Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies, and how do they work?


    **ANSWER:**

    Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies are a type of currency that is backed
    by one or more asset currencies at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to
    100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a
    particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously,
    addressing issues like miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running.



    **QUESTION:**

    How does the Verus DeFi protocol address miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running?


    **ANSWER:**

    The Verus DeFi protocol addresses miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running
    by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool
    and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This prevents
    miners from manipulating the order of transactions to extract value or front-run.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is a bridge converter liquidity pool, and how does it work?


    **ANSWER:**

    A bridge converter liquidity pool is a fully decentralized or centralized liquidity
    pool that is launched alongside a new blockchain as part of its definition. It
    has the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed
    currencies but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain and runs on it. All
    fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity
    pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain,
    only seamless connectivity.



    **QUESTION:**

    How do blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation
    or automatic refunds work?


    **ANSWER:**

    Blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or
    automatic refunds allow users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation
    in their preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimums are not met by the start
    time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all
    their pre-conversions, less the network fees.



    **QUESTION:**

    What are some of the launch options available for blockchain-based crowdfunding
    currency launches?


    **ANSWER:**

    Some of the launch options available for blockchain-based crowdfunding currency
    launches include maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts,
    price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve
    ratio to issue currencies, similarly price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and
    pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also
    include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations.'
