    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help answer any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about using an i-address as an ID name. Is that a good idea?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, using an i-address as an ID name can cause issues. It can lead to confusion when referring to a currency or identity. To reduce user confusion, the naming system will expand the set of characters that are not allowed for currency registrations. It's better to avoid using an i-address as an ID name to prevent potential problems.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also thinking about creating currencies from IDs in Verus. Are there any limitations to that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is a limitation. You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. To avoid problems, it's recommended to avoid doing this. Instead, choose a different name for your ID or currency.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I've also seen a disclaimer when using the Verus software. What does it say, and what does it mean for users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer states that the software is experimental and unfinished, and users should use it at their own risk. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, and the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software. This implies that users should be cautious when using the software and understand that it may have bugs or issues that are not yet resolved.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Finally, I've been trying to create a PBaaS chain in the Verus Desktop GUI, but I'm running into an issue. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus Desktop GUI, you cannot create a PBaaS chain with the same name as a currency that is already supported, such as BTC or ETH. This limitation is considered errata for the testnet release and will be resolved before the mainnet release. So, try choosing a different name for your PBaaS chain, and it should work.",
