    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering, how can I get the total amount received by a specific account with at least 6 confirmations using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getreceivedbyaccount` command to get the total amount received by a specific account with at least 6 confirmations, by specifying the account name and setting the minimum confirmation to 6. The command is:\n```\nverus getreceivedbyaccount \"tabby\" 6\n```\nGive it a try and let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful! Another question I have is how can I get the total amount received by a specific VRSC address with at least 1 confirmation using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getreceivedbyaddress` command to get the total amount received by a specific VRSC address with at least 1 confirmation. The command is:\n```\nverus getreceivedbyaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\"\n```\nJust replace the address with the one you're interested in, and you're good to go!\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I want to include unconfirmed transactions in the total amount received by a specific VRSC address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn that case, you can use the `getreceivedbyaddress` command and set the minimum confirmation to 0. The command is:\n```\nverus getreceivedbyaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 0\n```\nThis will give you the total amount received by the address, including unconfirmed transactions.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I get detailed information about a specific transaction using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `gettransaction` command to get detailed information about a specific transaction. The command is:\n```\nverus gettransaction \"txid\"\n```\nJust replace \"txid\" with the actual transaction ID, and you'll get all the details. You can also include watch-only addresses in the balance calculation and details by setting the `includeWatchonly` parameter to `true`. The command is:\n```\nverus gettransaction \"txid\" true\n```\nGive it a try and see what you can learn!\n\n**User:**\nHow can I get the total amount received by the default account with at least 1 confirmation using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEasy one! You can use the `getreceivedbyaccount` command to get the total amount received by the default account with at least 1 confirmation. The command is:\n```\nverus getreceivedbyaccount \"\"\n```\nJust leave the account name blank, and you'll get the total amount received by the default account.\n\n**User:**\nLast question: how can I get the total amount received by a specific account, including unconfirmed amounts, using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getreceivedbyaccount` command to get the total amount received by a specific account, including unconfirmed amounts, by specifying the account name and setting the minimum confirmation to 0. The command is:\n```\nverus getreceivedbyaccount \"tabby\" 0\n```\nReplace \"tabby\" with the actual account name, and you'll get the total amount received, including unconfirmed transactions.",
