    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about some new features coming to Verus. When can we expect to see the new features of v0.9.2 on the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new features in v0.9.2 will be on mainnet soon. We're excited to bring these updates to the community!\n\n**User:**\nThat's great news! I've also heard about some new capabilities on the Verus testnet. Can you tell me more about what's available on the testnet and what the goal is for interoperability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll PBaaS capabilities, including those for application development, are available on the new Verus testnet. The goal for interoperability on this new testnet is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge in the near future. This provides an opportunity for development-capable projects to get a head start on using Verus's transformative technologies by doing a deep dive on the Verus testnet.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a great opportunity for developers. I've also heard about some new features in Verus Desktop v0.9.2. What's new for visualizing the cross-chain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus Desktop v0.9.2, there is a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer that shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on-chain and cross-chain. This visualizer allows users to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions. It can be accessed by clicking on \"Visualize Network\" on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop. It's a really cool way to see the complexity and beauty of the Verus network!",
