    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about VerusHash, and I'm wondering, what is VerusHash 2.1, and how does it improve upon VerusHash 2.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 is an improvement to the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm, which was designed to equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which is expected to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still allowing FPGAs to operate with minor modifications. This update should provide a more level playing field for all participants in the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've heard the phrase \"not your keys, not your coins\" thrown around in the context of blockchain identity technology. Can you explain what that means?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe phrase \"not your keys, not your coins\" highlights the importance of controlling one's private keys in blockchain identity technology. If you lose your keys, you risk losing access to your digital assets, and no one can recover your money for you. This phrase emphasizes the need for a secure and reliable identity system, such as Verus ID, which provides a way to recover lost funds and protect against identity and key theft. It's crucial to have a system in place that allows you to maintain control over your digital identity and assets.\n\n**User:**\nSpeaking of Verus ID, what is it, and what are its key features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus ID is a decentralized identity technology that provides a secure, quantum-ready, fully decentralized, and self-sovereign digital identity system. It includes built-in privacy through the integration of zk-SNARKs and offers several benefits, such as recovery of lost funds after losing keys, security against identity and key theft, the ability to prove certain information without revealing more than necessary, and transfer of assets to heirs as part of an estate. Verus ID is a game-changer in the world of digital identity and asset management.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard of Verus Smart Transactions. How does it differ from crypto-conditions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Smart Transactions is a new smart transaction technology unique to the Verus network. It uses standard Bitcoin style serialization, which makes it simpler to implement support on lite or mobile wallets compared to crypto-conditions, which use ASN.1. Verus Smart Transactions will be available for use on other blockchains with the upcoming PBaaS network upgrade. This technology is a significant innovation in the field of smart transactions and will provide more flexibility and ease of use for users.",

This release also introduces a new smart transaction technology that is unique to the Verus network and replaces its use of Komodo compatible crypto-conditions. The Verus ID system was made possible through the use of Verus Smart Transactions, which will be available for everyone to use on their own blockchains in the upcoming PBaaS network upgrade. Verus Smart Transactions use standard Bitcoin style serialization rather than the ASN.1 used in crypto conditions, which makes support on lite or mobile wallets simpler to implement than the crypto-condition protocol, which is still used on the Verus network for Stake Guard. ## VerusHash 2.1 VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# Verus ID - A Better Blockchain Identity Technology If you\u2019ve been around crypto for even a little while, you\u2019ll start to hear things like \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d, \u201close your keys, lose your coins\u201d.
