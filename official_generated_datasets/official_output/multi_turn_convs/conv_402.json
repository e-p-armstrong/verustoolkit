    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with Verus, and I'm trying to understand some of the options. What is the purpose of the `-blockversion=<n>` option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-blockversion=<n>` option is used to override the block version to test forking scenarios. The default block version is 4. This option allows you to simulate different block versions for testing purposes.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering about the work queue for RPC calls. What is the default depth of the work queue to service RPC calls in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default depth of the work queue to service RPC calls in Verus is 16. This can be overridden using the `-rpcworkqueue=<n>` option. This setting determines how many RPC calls can be queued up before they start getting rejected.",
