    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help you understand Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about token launches on the Verus network. What are some of the advanced features of token launches on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome advanced features of token launches on the Verus network include:\n\n* Maximum participation in one or more currencies\n* Pre-launch discounts\n* Price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies\n* Similarly, price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds\n* Pre-launch discounts for early participants\n* Vesting schedules in the pre-allocations using VerusIDs\n\nThese features provide a high degree of flexibility and customization for token launches on Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What is the main benefit of the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main benefit of the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is that it allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, enabling unlimited scale and new use cases. This opens up a wide range of possibilities for innovation and growth.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a locked identity when it is revoked on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a locked identity is revoked, its locked status is cleared, regardless of the time delay or unlock height. This means that the identity is no longer locked and can be used freely.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen the `getcurrencyconverters` API mentioned. What is its purpose on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example, `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\n**User:**\nHow do Notary IDs work in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. They play a crucial role in facilitating interoperability between different blockchains on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `timelock` parameter when updating an identity on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `timelock` parameter can be used to define either the unlock height of the identity (Time Lock) or the number of blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state (Time Delay). This allows for more control over the timing of identity updates on the Verus network.",

            "Some advanced features of token launches on the Verus network include:\n\n* Maximum participation in one or more currencies\n* Pre-launch discounts\n* Price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies\n* Similarly, price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds\n* Pre-launch discounts for early participants\n* Vesting schedules in the pre-allocations using VerusIDs",
            "l of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. ## Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**   The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'   ``` - **Time Delay:**   The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'   ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ## Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g. BTC ETH:**   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth   ```   Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
