    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent in Verus. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent in Verus, you can use the `registernamecommitment` command with additional positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Then, specify the parent in the identity definition and register the identity using `registeridentity`. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, but I'm still a bit unclear on what the `registernamecommitment` command does. Can you explain its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `registernamecommitment` command in Verus is used to create a name commitment for an identity, which is a necessary step in registering an identity. It now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Does that clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question: how can I sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID on both the testnet and mainnet using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID on both the testnet and mainnet using Verus, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency` and `verus z_getoperationstatus`.\n2. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n3. Use `verus signrawtransaction` to apply the necessary signatures.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.\n\nDoes that help with multi-signature transactions?\n\n**User:**\nOne last question: what are the requirements for tokenizing ID control (next-generation NFT) in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo tokenize ID control (next-generation NFT) in Verus, the currency definition must have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre-allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0. Does that answer your question?",
