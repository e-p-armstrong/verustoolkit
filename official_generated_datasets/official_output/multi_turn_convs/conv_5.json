    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to assist you with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that there were some changes made to the testnet. What changes are introduced in v0.9.5-2 for the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn v0.9.5-2, minor notarization fixes are introduced for the testnet. These changes will be important for those intending to launch and witness PBaaS chains. Do you have any other questions about the testnet or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question I had was about the Ethereum bridge. What is the status of the Ethereum bridge, and how can I access it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAlthough its deployment has been delayed, there are no technical blockers, and it's expected to be brought back up on the new Verus testnet within the next day or two. You can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge at https://ethtest.verus.services/, and use your MetaMask to convert or send cross-chain to the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features, you'll need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus. Do you have any other questions about the Ethereum bridge or Verus?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that there was an important update recently. What is the importance of updating to Verus v0.9.5 or later by block 2291830?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUpdating to Verus v0.9.5 or later by block 2291830 is crucial to reliably stay synchronized to the Verus mainnet. If you haven't updated yet, it's recommended to do so now to avoid any potential issues. Make sure to update as soon as possible to ensure a smooth experience on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nWhat changes are introduced in v0.9.5 for the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn v0.9.5, spendable transactions are labeled for the `getaddressutxos` RPC API, which is used by Verus Mobile. This update is critical for users who haven't upgraded to v0.9.5+ before block 2291830. Do you have any other questions about v0.9.5 or the mainnet?",
