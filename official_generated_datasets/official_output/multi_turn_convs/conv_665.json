    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to learn more about the Verus API, and I came across the `getcurrencyconverters` API. What is its purpose, and how can I use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. You can use it to find currencies that have a specific market, for example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold. Do you have any other questions about the `getcurrencyconverters` API or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. But I do have another question. How can I use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus to send and convert funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus can be used to send and convert funds in various ways. For example, you can send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nOr, you can send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nOr, convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nAdditionally, you can preconvert to a new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refund\":true}]'\n```\nDo you have any other questions about the `sendcurrency` API or Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I've been trying to understand the concept of a fractal model in the Verus network. Can you explain it to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe fractal model in the Verus network refers to the ability of the network to support an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. This means that there is no limit to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the fractal model enables this unlimited scalability. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that does. One last question. How can I lock an ID on the Verus network, and what are the implications of doing so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock an ID on the Verus network using the `setidentitytimelock` command, specifying the unlock height of the identity or the unlock delay. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\": <Unlock block height>}'\n```\nor\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"setunlockdelay\": <Unlock block delay>}'`\n```\nA locked identity cannot revoke itself, and revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. Does that make sense? Do you have any other questions about Verus or its features?",
