    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been wondering about the warranty for the software. What kind of warranty does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, and NONINFRINGEMENT. So, it's essentially a use-at-your-own-risk situation. Do you have any other questions about the software?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What's the purpose of the current software release for testing and development with public blockchains as a service (PBaaS)?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis software release is intended for testing and development with public blockchains as a service (PBaaS). It is not an official release and does not support PBaaS on mainnet. So, it's more of a testing ground for development rather than a production-ready release. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to set up a chain, but I'm not sure what the requirements are. What's the minimum requirement for defining a chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum requirements for defining a chain include:\n\n1. A maximum of 3 eras.\n2. A minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations.\n3. A minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.\n4. Having VRSCTEST in the wallet to make a chain.\n\nMake sure you meet these requirements to successfully define a chain. Do you have any questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I've set up a chain. How can I connect to it now that it's created?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can connect to a defined chain using the command `./verusd-chain=SOMECOIN`, replacing `SOMECOIN` with the name of the chain. On first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.\n\n**User:**\nWhere are the config files for PBaaS chains stored, by the way?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe config files for PBaaS chains are stored in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME` directory, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain. The presence of a correct config file enables the chain to load as an independent chain.",
