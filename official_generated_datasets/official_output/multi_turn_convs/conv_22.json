    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the security of VerusIDs. What kind of threats does the VerusID protocol protect against?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusID protocol protects against $5 wrench attacks and identity theft. It's designed to keep your identity and assets safe from these types of threats.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know. What are some features of IDs in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIDs can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. Additionally, the VerusID protocol can be implemented on non-Verus systems. This makes it really versatile and convenient to use.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also interested in crowdfunding options for blockchain and bridge launches in the Verus protocol. What options are available?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBlockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches can be set up with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge). Users can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on chain, and if by the start time of the blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of their contributions.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a great way to ensure successful launches. I've also heard about DeFi fractional basket currencies in the Verus protocol. Can you explain what they are and how they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAny ID owner can define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. How do simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches work in the Verus protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe launch of a new blockchain can be accompanied by a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but are bound to the launch of the new blockchain, run on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of possibilities do users with an ID have in the Verus protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsers with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. These blockchains are 50% POW/50% POS and 51% hash attack resistant. The possibilities are really endless!\n\n**User:**\nFinally, can you explain how PBaaS chains work in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects can choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. By doing so, they start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.",
