    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new currency, and I was wondering, how can I mint new coins in a currency like \"mycoin\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can mint new coins in a currency like \"mycoin\" by issuing the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins in the \"mycoin\" currency. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. I'm also trying to convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency, such as GOLD. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD by issuing the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will park your conversion until the GOLD token launches, at which point you will either receive the converted amount of GOLD or have your VRSCTEST returned. Do you have any more questions about currency conversion?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I'm trying to create a new currency that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a new currency, such as \"mycoin\", by defining it with the `definecurrency` command, specifying the currency's name, options, proof protocol, currencies, conversions, and minimum preconversion amounts. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":96, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"conversions\":[0.01, 1.0],\"minpreconversion\":[1000,1000]}' \n```\nIn this example, \"mycoin\" is created with a proof protocol of 2, which allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Does that help you create your new currency?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. What do I need to create a currency of a specific name in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. So, if you want to create a currency called \"mycoin\", you'll need an ID called \"mycoin\" first.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. How can I define a currency in Verus, and what are the requirements for launching it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can define a currency using the `definecurrency` command, specifying the currency's name, options, currencies, conversions, and preallocation. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' \n```\nTo launch the currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST, and have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at the specified conversion rate. The currency will launch 50 blocks after the transaction is mined.",

I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level. First, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' ``` of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches. After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]' ``` that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
