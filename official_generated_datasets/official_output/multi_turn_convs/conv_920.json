    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering what happens to transactions sent to an identity when a new address type or signature algorithm is added to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure, is added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well. This means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really cool! What about transferring identities in Verus? How does that work, and what happens to the associated funds and authorities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIdentities can be transferred by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party\u2019s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so. Additionally, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. It's a pretty straightforward process, but it does require some careful planning to make sure everything is updated correctly.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also curious about the key components of an identity in Verus, and what their roles are.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach identity in Verus has three key components:\n\n1. **Primary**: This is the self-identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent (which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined), and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.\n2. **Revocation**: This identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n3. **Recovery**: This authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.\n\nThese three components work together to provide a high level of control and security for identities in Verus.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I was wondering about the relationship between an identity and a currency address in Verus.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, an identity and a currency address are one and the same. Your friendly name can be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer. This makes it easy to use and manage your identities and funds in Verus.",
