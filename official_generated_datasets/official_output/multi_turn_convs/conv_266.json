    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been using the Verus software, and my antivirus software is flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and the software is safe to use. You don't need to worry about it; it's just an overcautious antivirus software doing its job.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been experimenting with PBaaS chains in the current Verus Desktop testnet release. I've noticed some limitations. What are they?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the current Verus Desktop testnet release, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability. So, don't worry, it's just a temporary restriction.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. What kind of warranty or liability is provided with the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.",
