    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a Verus ID. What are the two steps involved in making a Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe two steps involved in making a Verus ID are:\n\n1. Committing to a friendly name: This step registers your commitment to a name, but keeps the name secret until you register it and reveal your commitment.\n2. Registering the name: This step requires paying a fee of 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST with a referral) and reveals your commitment to the name.\n\nDo you have any questions about these steps?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How does the referral system work when creating a Verus ID? I see you mentioned a referral option in the registration step.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen creating a Verus ID, you can use a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the registration fee is reduced to 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. The referral funds are distributed as follows:\n\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined\n\nAll funds not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain. This way, the referral system incentivizes the creation of a strong and active community within Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But why are the two-step process of committing and registering a name necessary?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe two-step process is designed to prevent \"name front running\", where a selfish miner could replace your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. By committing to a name first and then registering it, you ensure that you have a secure and fair way to acquire a Verus ID. Do you have any more questions about Verus IDs or the registration process?",

            "## Making a new identity Arguably, the hardest part of the new Verus identity technology is just making your first identity, especially without a GUI. Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ \u2018[{\u201caddress\u201d:\u201dalice@\u201d, \u201camount\u201d:100}]\u2019 ``` or ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100 ``` Making a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. To prevent this name \u201cfront running\u201d, you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows:- 20 VRSC to the referrer\u2019s ID - 20 VRSC to the referrer\u2019s referrer\u2019s ID - 20 VRSC to the referrer\u2019s referrer\u2019s referrer\u2019s ID - 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined100% of all funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.## To create an identity:",
