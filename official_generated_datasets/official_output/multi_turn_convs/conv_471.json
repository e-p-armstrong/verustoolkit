    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey, I was thinking of trying out pool mining on a Raspberry Pi-like device. What are the requirements for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo engage in pool mining on a Raspberry Pi-like device, you'll need a few specific things. First, you'll need a 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled. Next, you'll need a 64-bit operating system - note that Raspbian, the standard OS for Raspberry Pi, is 32-bit, so you'll need an alternative.\n\nYou'll also need an ARM release of a mining software like CCMiner or NHEQminer. Additionally, you'll need low latency internet connectivity to communicate with the mining pool. You'll also need a public address to mine to, as well as a public mining pool to connect to.\n\nKeep in mind that pool mining on a Raspberry Pi-like device might not be the most profitable or efficient way to mine, but it can be a fun project to try out! Do you have any other questions about pool mining or Verus in general?",
