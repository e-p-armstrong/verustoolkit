    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the Verus Desktop GUI, and I'm wondering, what's the limitation when creating a PBaaS chain with a name that is already used by a supported currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for the testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about creating PBaaS chains?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering, what's the importance of not using an i-address as the name of an ID when creating a currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsing an i-address as the name of an ID when creating a currency in Verus can cause problems and confusion, as it may be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. It is recommended to avoid doing so to prevent potential issues. It's always best to keep your naming conventions clear and distinct. Do you have any more questions about creating currencies in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. What are the overridable defaults for the bridge in a PBaaS blockchain definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe overridable defaults for the bridge in a PBaaS blockchain definition include:\n\n1. `currencies`: An array of currencies that the bridge supports.\n2. `initialcontributions`: An array of initial contributions to the bridge for each currency.\n3. `initialsupply`: The initial supply of the bridge's native token.\n\nThese defaults can be overridden in your PBaaS blockchain definition to customize the bridge to your needs. Do you have any more questions about bridge settings?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. What are the components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus consists of several components, including:\n\n1. `name`: The name of the blockchain.\n2. `options`: An integer that specifies the options for the blockchain.\n3. `currencies`: An array of currencies that the blockchain supports.\n4. `conversions`: An array of conversion rates between the currencies.\n5. `eras`: An array of era schedules, including the reward, decay, halving, and era end.\n6. `notaries`: An array of notaries that validate transactions on the blockchain.\n7. `minnotariesconfirm`: The minimum number of notaries required to confirm a transaction.\n8. `nodes`: An array of nodes that make up the blockchain network.\n9. `gatewayconvertername`: The name of the gateway converter.\n10. `gatewayconverterissuance`: The initial issuance of the gateway converter.\n\nThese components work together to define the parameters and behavior of your PBaaS blockchain. Do you have any more questions about PBaaS blockchain definitions?",
