    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about Verus Vault. What is it, and how does it protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows users to protect funds on a VerusID, even in the event of private key theft. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the funds cannot be spent until the ID is unlocked. During this time, the funds can still be staked on the Verus network and earn rewards. The lock can be revoked and recovered by the revocation and recovery authority identities, which provides an additional layer of security. Additionally, a locked VerusID can be set with a predetermined unlock time, providing a decentralized solution to the \"5-dollar wrench attack\".\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a great feature. What are the requirements for enabling revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities, you must have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This allows for the secure management of your VerusID and funds, and provides an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What are some of the additional capabilities of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus has several additional capabilities, including on-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, as well as on-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming. It also supports on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles.\n\n**User:**\nThat's impressive. What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. Buyers and sellers can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post their sale publicly for everyone to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. Payment can be made from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, and owners can select and share proceeds with value-added agents or other participants.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. Thanks for explaining all this to me!",

At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs.
