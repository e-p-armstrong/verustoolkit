    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new fractional reserve currency, and I was wondering about the `prelaunchdiscount` option. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `prelaunchdiscount` option specifies the discount on the final price at launch for fractional reserve currencies less than 100%. It's an important setting to consider when creating a new currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about when defining a new PBaaS chain? I saw an `gatewayconvertername` option. What's that for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `gatewayconvertername` option specifies the name of a co-launched gateway converter currency for the PBaaS chain. It's an essential configuration when setting up a new PBaaS chain.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also trying to define a new chain, and I saw the `initialcontributions` option. What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `initialcontributions` option specifies the initial contribution in each currency. It's a crucial setting when creating a new chain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the `currencies` option? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `currencies` option specifies the reserve currencies backing the chain in equal amounts. It's an important configuration when defining a new chain.\n\n**User:**\nI saw the `blocktime` option as well. What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `blocktime` option specifies the target time in seconds to average between blocks. By default, it's set to 60 seconds, but you can adjust it according to your needs.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about when defining a new transaction? I saw the `expiryheight` option. What's that for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `expiryheight` option specifies the block height at which the transaction expires. If not specified, it defaults to the current block height plus 20.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also trying to define a new currency or chain, and I saw the `notarizationprotocol` option. What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `notarizationprotocol` option specifies the protocol used for notarization. If set to 2, the currency can be minted by whoever controls the ID.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the `proofprotocol` option? What does that specify?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `proofprotocol` option specifies the type of proof protocol used for minting and burning currencies. There are several options, including `PROOF_PBAASMMR` (1) for Verus MMR proof, `PROOF_CHAINID` (2) for Chain ID notarization, and `PROOF_ETHNOTARIZATION` (3) for Ethereum notarization and PATRICIA TRIE proof.\n\n**User:**\nI saw the `prelaunchcarveout` option when defining a new chain. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `prelaunchcarveout` option specifies the percentage of pre-converted amounts from each reserve currency that go to specific identities. It's an important setting to consider when creating a new chain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the `minpreconversion` option? What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `minpreconversion` option specifies the minimum amount in each currency required to launch the chain. It must be the same size as the `currencies` list.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I saw the `initialsupply` option when defining a new fractional reserve currency. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `initialsupply` option specifies the supply of the currency after conversion of contributions, before pre-allocation. It's an important setting to consider when creating a new fractional reserve currency.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.",
