    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with some Verus commands, and I'm not entirely sure what some of them do. Can you help me out? Specifically, what is the result of the `z_shieldcoinbase` command, and what information does it provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `z_shieldcoinbase` command is a JSON object that provides the following information:\n\n* `remainingUTXOs`: The number of coinbase utxos still available for shielding.\n* `remainingValue`: The value of coinbase utxos still available for shielding.\n* `shieldingUTXOs`: The number of coinbase utxos being shielded.\n* `shieldingValue`: The value of coinbase utxos being shielded.\n* `opid`: An operation ID to pass to `z_getoperationstatus` to get the result of the operation.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the `z_shieldcoinbase` command or its output?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What is the purpose of the `z_viewtransaction` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_viewtransaction` command is used to get detailed shielded information about an in-wallet transaction, specified by its `txid`.\n\nDo you have any questions about how to use the `z_viewtransaction` command or what kind of information it provides?\n\n**User:**\nI was also wondering about the optional \"fee\" argument for in the `z_shieldcoinbase` command. What is its default value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe optional \"fee\" argument in the `z_shieldcoinbase` command is used to specify the fee amount to attach to this transaction. Its default value is 0.0001.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the \"fee\" argument or how it affects the `z_shieldcoinbase` command?\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about the optional \"limit\" argument? What is its default value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe optional \"limit\" argument in the `z_shieldcoinbase` command is used to limit the maximum number of utxos to shield. Its default value is 50.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the \"limit\" argument or how it affects the `z_shieldcoinbase` command?\n\n**User:**\nI think I have a better understanding of the arguments now. But what is the main purpose of the `z_shieldcoinbase` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_shieldcoinbase` command is used to shield transparent coinbase funds by sending them to a shielded z-addr. This is an asynchronous operation, and the selected utxos will be locked during the process. If there's an error, they will be unlocked.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the `z_shieldcoinbase` command or how it works?\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. What are the required arguments for the `z_shieldcoinbase` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required arguments for the `z_shieldcoinbase` command are:\n\n1. \"fromaddress\" (string, required) - The address is a taddr or \"*\" for all taddrs belonging to the wallet.\n2. \"toaddress\" (string, required) - The address is a zaddr.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or need further clarification!",
