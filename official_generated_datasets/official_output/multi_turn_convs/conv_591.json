    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm experimenting with testnet coins and currencies on VRSCTEST. What's important to note about them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! All testnet coins and currencies on VRSCTEST have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. Keep that in mind when testing!\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the heads up! I was also wondering about the `getcurrencyconverters` API. What does it do, and how do I use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. You can use it by specifying the currencies you're interested in, like this:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\n\nThis will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! Now, I have a question about locked identities. Can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a locked identity when it is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a locked identity is revoked, its locked status is cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How do I lock an ID with a time lock, using the Verus command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo lock an ID with a time lock, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter set to the unlock block height. Here's an example:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I've been wondering about the Verus network's fractal model. What's the main advantage of it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main advantage of the Verus network's fractal model is that it allows for an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains, with no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.",
