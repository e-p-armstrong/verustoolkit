    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm thinking of installing the software, but I'm a bit worried about potential warnings or liabilities. What kind of warnings may I encounter when installing this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). These are warnings that you are installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. Don't worry, it's just a precautionary measure.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What kind of liabilities are the authors or copyright holders of this software liable for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders of this software are not liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! What kind of permissions are granted to users of this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. What kind of software is this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis release is experimental and unfinished software. It is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.\n\n**User:**\nI think I may have an older version of VRSCTEST. What do I need to do if I have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release, you need to delete the following directories before running this new update:\n- On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n- On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n- On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\nDon't worry, it's an easy step to ensure a smooth update!",
