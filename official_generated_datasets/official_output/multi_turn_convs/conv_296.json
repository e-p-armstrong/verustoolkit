    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how the APIs work. Can you tell me about the `getcurrencyconverters` API? What does it do, and how can I use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. You can use it by specifying the currencies you are interested in, for example, `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` to retrieve all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What about sending and converting funds using the `sendcurrency` API? How does that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds in various ways, such as sending VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to multiple recipients, converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, converting VRSCTEST to another reserve through a fractional currency, or preconverting to a new currency before it is active. The API command takes two arguments: the source of the funds and an array of objects specifying the currency, address, amount, and conversion options.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the `preconvert` option when using the `sendcurrency` API? How does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `preconvert` option allows you to preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency before it is active. When you set `preconvert` to `true`, the funds will be parked until the new currency is active, and then the conversion will be done. If the currency is not activated, the funds will be refunded to the specified refund address.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about updating identities using the `updateidentity` command. What's the purpose of the `timelock` parameter?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `timelock` parameter defines either the unlock height of the identity or the delay in blocks before an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state, depending on the flags setting.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how can I lock an identity using the `updateidentity` command? What does it mean for the identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock an identity by setting the `flags` parameter to 2 and specifying a `timelock` value, which defines the delay in blocks before the ID's unlock. A locked identity cannot revoke itself, and its locked status will be cleared if it is revoked.",
