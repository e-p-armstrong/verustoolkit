    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you may have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been looking into PBaaS blockchain definitions in Verus. What are the essential components of one?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe essential components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus include:\n\n1. `name`: The name of the chain.\n2. `options`: An integer that configures various options for the chain.\n3. `currencies`: An array of currency tickers that the chain's native currency can be converted into.\n4. `conversions`: An array of conversion ratios between the chain's native currency and each currency on the chain.\n5. `eras`: An array of objects defining the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each \"era\" in the chain's lifecycle.\n6. `notaries`: An array of VerusIDs that will serve as notaries on the chain.\n7. `minnotariesconfirm`: An integer specifying the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block.\n8. `nodes`: An array of objects describing the network addresses of the nodes on the chain, as well as their IDs.\n9. `gatewayconvertername`: The name of the bridge converter.\n10. `gatewayconverterissuance`: The initial issuance of the bridge converter's native token.\n\nThese components are crucial for defining a PBaaS blockchain in Verus. Do you have any questions about these components or would you like more information?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful! I also have a question about working with multi-currency in Verus. Is there an important limitation I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen working with multi-currency in Verus, there's an important limitation to be aware of. You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name (not its calculated ID). This can cause problems when using i-addresses or names, and is not supported for creating currencies. Keep this in mind when working with multi-currency in Verus. Do you have any other questions about multi-currency or Verus in general?",
