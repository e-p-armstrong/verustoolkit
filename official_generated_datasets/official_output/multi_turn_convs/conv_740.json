    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been looking into Verus' launch options, but I'm not entirely clear on what features they provide.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus' launch options provide features such as setting required minimum levels of worldwide participation in preferred currencies on the chain, maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds, pre-launch discounts for early participants, and vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What's the main benefit of Verus' blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main benefit of Verus' blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches is that they allow for seamless connectivity, automatic refunds, and flexible launch options. If the minimum participation levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees.\n\n**User:**\nI've also seen the `getcurrencyconverters` API mentioned. What's that used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a locked identity if it is revoked on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a locked identity is revoked on Verus, its locked status will be cleared, regardless of the time delay or unlock height.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what's the purpose of the timelock parameter in updating an identity on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity or the number of blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n\n**User:**\nLastly, I'd like to know more about the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network. What's it capable of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, enabling new use cases and unlimited scale. Notary IDs provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains.",

            "g back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity. ## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge) - Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. ### Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}' ``` - **Time Delay:**  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}' ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ## Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reser",
