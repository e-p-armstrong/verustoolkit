    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've got a few questions. What kind of warranty or liability does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. Just to clarify, we don't provide any warranty or take on any liability for the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also noticed that some antivirus software flags the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program) because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these warnings. It's just a precautionary measure on their part, but rest assured that Verus is safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, good to know. How can I verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus software download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus software download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, which contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the signature and checksum of the download. For example:\n\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"Aa0DJwABQSChXw/NphqzkcaFyWwJzhP0g+78oxZoJtFIB8CR4J+X/DcQdXTR849aOvHYkCBc1UKoTmWmrXXZs5iwjYutbcs3\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v1.0.6-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v1.0.6-x86_64.tar.gz\"\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"Aa0DJwABQSChXw/NphqzkcaFyWwJzhP0g+78oxZoJtFIB8CR4J+X/DcQdXTR849aOvHYkCBc1UKoTmWmrXXZs5iwjYutbcs3\" 67cc123c25b7bf7ad01d16c1b9556f80c18fee3595f6e556d0245a67ef51263f\n```\n\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`. Does that help?",
