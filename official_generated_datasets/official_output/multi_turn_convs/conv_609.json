    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering, what does it mean for a VerusID to be recoverable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is recoverable, meaning that it includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to the identity itself. This recovery authority can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state. However, it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What about revocability? What does it mean for a VerusID to be revocable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is revocable, meaning that it includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity itself. This revocation authority has the permission to revoke the identity, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft. Once revoked, the identity cannot be used to spend or sign until it is recovered. This adds an extra layer of security to VerusIDs.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! I've also heard about VerusHash 2.0 and VerusHash 2.1. What's the purpose of those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.0 was designed to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs on the Verus network. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, aiming to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. This helps to ensure a fair and secure network for all participants.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really cool. I've also been wondering, what kind of privacy features do VerusIDs provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs provide private zero-knowledge addresses, which can be used for various purposes such as messaging, financial transactions, or voting. They also contain a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and identity policies to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, and selectively provable components of a strong identity. This ensures that your personal information and data remain private and secure.",

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# Disclaimer",
