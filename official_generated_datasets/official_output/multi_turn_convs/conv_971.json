    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI've been having some issues with antivirus software. Why do some antivirus software flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can learn more about it from the resources provided. Don't worry, it's just a misunderstanding! Do you have any further questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nWhat permissions are granted to users of this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files, to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the conditions stated in the disclaimer. In other words, you're free to use, modify, and distribute the software as you see fit!\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of software is this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis release is experimental and unfinished software. It is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, and NONINFRINGEMENT. Use at your own risk! Just keep in mind that it's still in development, so you might encounter some issues.\n\n**User:**\nWhat should I do if I have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release, you should delete the following directories before running this new update:\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\nThis will ensure a clean start with the new version.",
