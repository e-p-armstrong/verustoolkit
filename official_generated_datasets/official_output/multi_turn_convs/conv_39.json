    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been looking into updating IDs on Verus, and I was wondering, what's the purpose of the timelock parameter when updating an ID, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe timelock parameter when updating an ID on Verus serves two purposes: Time Lock and Time Delay. Time Lock defines the unlock height of the identity, which means that the ID will be locked until the specified block height is reached. Time Delay defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. This allows for a delay in unlocking the ID after it has been locked.\n\nTo update an ID with a timelock parameter, you can use the command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nDo you have any other questions about updating IDs or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I've been wondering about the Verus network as a whole. What is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what are its capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is an interoperable network that allows for the creation of an unlimited number of blockchains. These blockchains can be public or private, and they can interoperate seamlessly with each other. Notary IDs provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private internal blockchains that can be easily set up with bridging of public currencies.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. How do blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches work on Verus, and what happens if minimum participation levels are not met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBlockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches on Verus allow for minimum participation levels to be set in preferred currencies on the chain. If these minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations, and vesting schedules.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how does this relate to asset-backed currencies and the launch of a new blockchain on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAsset-backed currencies on Verus are bound to the launch of a new blockchain. They run on the new blockchain, and all fees generated through cross-chain fee conversions or use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This allows for seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and the Verus network.",
