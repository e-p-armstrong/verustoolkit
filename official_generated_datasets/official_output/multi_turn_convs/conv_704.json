    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm working with multi-currency in Verus and I was wondering, what are some limitations to be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen working with multi-currency in Verus, there are two main limitations to be aware of:\n\n1. IDs with i-addresses as names: It is not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name, as this can cause problems when trying to use the i-address or name in various contexts, including creating currencies.\n\n2. Conflicting currency names in the GUI: In the GUI, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop (e.g., BTC or ETH), you will not be able to use those same names for a PBaaS chain. However, this limitation is considered errata and will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\nDo you have any questions about these limitations or would you like me to elaborate on them?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, can you elaborate on the first limitation, IDs with i-addresses as names?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe general advice is to avoid creating IDs with i-addresses as names, as this can cause problems and confusion in various contexts. It's better to keep your IDs and i-addresses separate to avoid any potential issues.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. What is the disclaimer for using this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",

            "#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of: 1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain.
