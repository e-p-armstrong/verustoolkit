What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm thinking about using Verus, but I want to know, what kind of warranty or guarantee does this software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis software comes with no warranty or guarantee. It is provided \"as is\", without any kind of express or implied warranty, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\n**User:**\nThat's important to know. What kind of liability do the authors or copyright holders of this software assume?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders of this software assume no liability for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also considering mining with Verus. What might happen when I try to install mining software on my computer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, might flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which could potentially be used by a third party to exploit your computer. However, this is a false positive, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about these warnings.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Where can I check the virus scan results for a software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can check the virus scan results for a software on the VirusTotal website, where links are provided for different operating systems, including MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows.",
