    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to define a PBaaS blockchain using Verus. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a PBaaS blockchain using Verus, you need to create a JSON object with the following properties:\n\n* `name`: the name of the chain\n* `options`: an integer specifying the options for the chain\n* `currencies`: an array of currencies that can be converted to on the chain\n* `conversions`: an array of conversion ratios between the chain's native currency and each currency on the chain\n* `eras`: an array defining the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each \"era\" in the chain's lifecycle\n* `notaries`: an array of VerusIDs that will serve as notaries on the chain\n* `minnotariesconfirm`: an integer specifying the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block\n* `nodes`: an array describing the network addresses of the nodes on the chain, as well as their IDs\n* `gatewayconvertername`: the name of the bridge converter\n* `gatewayconverterissuance`: the initial issuance of the bridge converter\n\nYou then need to pass this JSON object to the `definecurrency` command, along with another JSON object specifying the overridable defaults for the bridge. That should do it! Do you have any more questions about defining a PBaaS blockchain on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps a lot, thanks! But I was also wondering, are there any limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are two limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus:\n\n1. You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n\n2. In the GUI, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.\n\nKeep those limitations in mind, and you should be good to go!",
