    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about Verus, but I want to know what kind of risks are associated with using the Verus software and what kind of warranty does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGreat question! The Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and it comes with a disclaimer stating that it is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nI see. That's good to know. What about VerusHash? I heard there's a new version, 2.1. What improvements does it introduce compared to VerusHash 2.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which is expected to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. But what is VerusHash, and what are its goals?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash is a hash algorithm used by the Verus network. The goal of VerusHash is to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs, ensuring that neither has a significant advantage over the other. This is achieved by explicitly equalizing FPGAs and CPUs, allowing them to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about VerusIDs being private. What does it mean for a VerusID to be private, and what features does it have to support this privacy?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID being private means that it contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used for various endpoints such as messaging, financial transactions, or voting. Additionally, each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used with applications and identity policies to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations.",

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network. # DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
