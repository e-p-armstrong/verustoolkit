    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm thinking of using the Verus Desktop software, but I want to know what the risks are.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! The Verus Desktop software is still experimental and unfinished, so use of it is entirely at your own risk. There is no liability for any kind of damage, including but not limited to claims, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What kind of warranty or guarantee does the software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software comes with no warranty or guarantee of any kind. It is provided \"AS IS\", without any express or implied warranties, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that some antivirus software flags the Verus Desktop software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is flagged as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) by some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, because it is mining software that can potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not actually malicious.",
