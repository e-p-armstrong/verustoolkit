    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm getting a weird error with my antivirus software. It says the Verus software is a potential threat. What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYour antivirus software might flag the Verus software as a potential threat because it contains mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about it. Don't worry, it's just a misunderstanding between your antivirus and the Verus software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But before I proceed, what's the disclaimer for using this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! The software is experimental and unfinished, and you use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage. The software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. I just updated to the latest release, how do I launch the testnet now?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEasy one! To launch the testnet, you need to run the following command: `./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST`\n\n**User:**\nI think I had an older version of VRSCTEST running before. What do I need to do now?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the latest release, you need to delete the following directories before running the new update:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST` and `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\VerusTest`\n\nJust delete those directories and you're good to go!",
