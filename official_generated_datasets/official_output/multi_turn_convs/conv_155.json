    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about VerusIDs and I'm still a bit unclear on some things. What is meant by \"private\" in the context of VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the context of VerusIDs, \"private\" refers to the fact that each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses. These private addresses can be used as endpoints for various purposes such as messaging, financial transactions, or voting. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, which can be used to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity, once quantum secure signatures are available. Does that clarify things for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Another thing I'm curious about is the benefits of having multiple primary addresses associated with a VerusID. What are the benefits of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nHaving multiple primary addresses associated with a VerusID makes it \"powerful\" because it allows for more flexibility and control over the identity. Specifically, any number of primary addresses can be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity, which is known as an N of M multisig control. This means that multiple parties can be involved in the decision-making process, and a certain number of them must agree before any changes can be made. Furthermore, the revocation authority and recovery authority can also be set up with their own N of M multisig controls, adding an extra layer of security and control. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where multiple parties need to be involved in the management of an identity, such as in business or organizational settings.",
