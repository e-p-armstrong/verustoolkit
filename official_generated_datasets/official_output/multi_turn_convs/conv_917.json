    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nHey, I was wondering about the GUI wallet. What fixes can users expect, and what additional currencies are now supported?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsers can expect a fix for the Electron certificate issue, which was affecting prices and preventing BTC fee calculation. Additionally, support has been added for some popular ERC20 currencies, in anticipation of more usage after the release of the ETH bridge.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I've been curious about the importance of Verus as a platform. Can you tell me a bit more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus is a platform, not a social network. While the capability of creating self-sovereign social media profiles is exciting, the true potential of Verus lies in its ability to enable new, self-sovereign user experiences, applications, and accompanying businesses to enable the future, truly decentralized web.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. I've also heard about the `getvdxfid` RPC call. What's that used for, and what can it be used to create?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getvdxfid` RPC call is used to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys, along with your ID and published names. This can be used to create self-sovereign, completely decentralized, rent-free, non-cancelable social media profiles.\n\n**User:**\nI've been following the development of the Ethereum gateway/bridge. What new feature is being introduced in the upcoming release, and how will it be tested?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new feature being introduced is support for the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge. This feature will be tested on the release testing network with community test volunteers before being launched, which is expected to happen within a day or two.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about the testnet reset. What's the purpose of that, and what fixes can users expect in this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe testnet reset is intended to address all reported PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID user issues. Users can expect fixes for all previously reported issues in this release.\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the command line and Verus. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nThis command exports the ID \"IDNAME@\" to the PBaaS chain \"PBaaSChainName\" with an amount of 100 VRSCTEST.\n\n**User:**\nLastly, I was wondering about resetting my testnet. How do I do that, and what directories do I need to delete?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your testnet, make sure Verus is closed and no testnet daemon is running. Then, delete the following directories, and restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native):\n\n* Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`\n* Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`, `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`\n\nI hope that helps!",
