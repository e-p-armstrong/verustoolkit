    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you may have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to create a PBaaS chain, and I'm running into some issues. What's a limitation in the GUI when creating a PBaaS chain with a currency name that is already supported in Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI can help you with that. In the GUI, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Before I continue, what's the disclaimer for using this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! This software is experimental and unfinished. Use at your own risk! No warranty for any kind of damage! The software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. Another question I have is, what's a limitation when creating a currency from an ID with a properly encoded i-address as its actual name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an ID has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, you will not be able to make a currency from that ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Why is it not recommended to make an ID with an i-address as its name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt's not recommended to make an ID with an i-address as its name because it will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (in many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies.",
