    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a PBaaS blockchain using Verus. Can you guide me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a PBaaS blockchain using Verus, you can create a JSON object with the following properties: `name`, `options`, `currencies`, `conversions`, `eras`, `notaries`, `minnotariesconfirm`, `nodes`, `gatewayconvertername`, and `gatewayconverterissuance`. Here's an example:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"PBaaSChain\",\n  \"options\": 330,\n  \"currencies\": [ \"VRSCTEST\" ],\n  \"conversions\": [ 1 ],\n  \"eras\": [ { \"reward\": 1200000000, \"decay\": 0, \"halving\": 0, \"eraend\": 0 } ],\n  \"notaries\": [ \"Notary1@\", \"Notary2@\", \"Notary3@\" ],\n  \"minnotariesconfirm\": 2,\n  \"nodes\": [\n    { \"networkaddress\": \"111.111.111.111:10000\", \"nodeidentity\": \"Node1@\" },\n    { \"networkaddress\": \"111.111.111.112:10000\", \"nodeidentity\": \"Node2@\" }\n  ],\n  \"gatewayconvertername\": \"Bridge\",\n  \"gatewayconverterissuance\": 1000000\n}\n```\nThen, you need to pass this definition to the `definecurrency` command, along with the bridge definition overrides. Does this example help you get started?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! I'm also curious about potential limitations when working with multi-currency in Verus. What should I be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are two limitations to be aware of:\n\n1. You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n2. (Only applicable in the GUI) If a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.\n\nThese limitations are important to keep in mind to avoid potential issues and user confusion. Do you have any more questions about working with multi-currency in Verus or PBaaS blockchains?",
