    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI want to make sure I have the right package. How can I verify the signature of a downloaded Verus package using a checksum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the signature of a downloaded Verus package using the `verifyhash` command. Here's an example:\n\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"signature\" \"checksum\"\n```\n\nReplace \"signature\" with the actual signature from the txt file, and \"checksum\" with the actual checksum of the downloaded package. Do you have any questions about this process, or would you like to know what the command returns if the signature is valid?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what does the command return if the signature is valid?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the signature is valid, the command returns `true`. That's a good indication that your package is authentic and hasn't been tampered with. Do you have any questions about the recent release of Verus, v0.9.4-4?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. What are the main changes in the v0.9.4-4 release of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.9.4-4 release primarily upgrades the ETH bridge and fixes a PBaaS cross-chain notarization issue. There are no material mainnet changes. If you're curious about the txt file that comes with each Verus download, I can explain what it's for.\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what's in the txt file? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe txt file contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. It is provided to allow users to verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded package. The packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". You can use this information to verify the signature of your downloaded package.\n\n**User:**\nCan you walk me through how to do that using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the signature of a downloaded Verus package using the `verifyfile` command. Here's an example:\n\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"signature\" \"/path/to/downloaded/package.tar.gz\"\n```\n\nReplace \"signature\" with the actual signature from the txt file, and \"/path/to/downloaded/package.tar.gz\" with the path to the downloaded package. If everything checks out, the command will return `true`, indicating that your package is valid and authentic. Do you have any more questions about verifying signatures or using Verus?",

There are no actual protocol changes.The ETH bridge upgrade introduces the ability to enter notarizations between Ethereum Goerli and VRSCTEST using bridgekeeper without an Ethereum private key in your conf file. This will enable you to still mine and potentially earn by agreeing or disagreeing with notarizations mined into the Verus blockchain, without needing to make transactions on or spend Ethereum for fees.

To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release.
