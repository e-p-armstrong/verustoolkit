    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get a better grasp on how Verus identities work. What is the purpose of the `timelock` parameter when updating an identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `timelock` parameter serves two purposes depending on the `flags` setting. If `flags` is set to 0, `timelock` defines the unlock height of the identity, meaning the identity will be locked until the specified block height is reached. If `flags` is set to 2, `timelock` defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. I'm also curious about the bigger picture of the Verus network. What is the concept of the Verus network in terms of blockchains and their interactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network is designed to support an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. This is achieved through a fractal model, which allows for continuous operation and interoperation between blockchains, with some overhead for cross-notarization. The idea is to create a network where many blockchains can coexist and interact seamlessly.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. Going back to identities, can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. Once an identity is locked, it needs to be unlocked or revoked by the designated authority.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a locked identity when it is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRevoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of any time delay or unlock height that was previously set. So, revocation takes precedence over any lock settings.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. What is the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. This allows users to query for currencies that meet specific liquidity thresholds. It's a useful tool for finding currencies with sufficient liquidity for conversions.",
