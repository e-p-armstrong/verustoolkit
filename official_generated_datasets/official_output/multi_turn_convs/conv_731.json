    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please go ahead and ask away!\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about Notary IDs. What is their purpose in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about Notary IDs or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that helps. Another thing I'm curious about is how to lock an ID on the Verus network. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock an ID on the Verus network by setting the `flags` parameter to 0 and specifying a `timelock` parameter with the unlock block height using the `updateidentity` command. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nDoes that help? Do you have any further questions about locking IDs on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. I also had a question about locking IDs. What's the difference between a Time Lock and a Time Delay when locking an ID on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA Time Lock defines the unlock height of the identity, while a Time Delay defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. So, they're related but serve slightly different purposes. Does that clarify things for you?\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks. What happens when you revoke an ID that is locked on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRevoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. However, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. So, revoking an ID will essentially reset its lock status. Do you have any more questions about ID locking or revocation on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's clear. I had a question about the `getcurrencyconverters` API on the Verus network. What is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. This API can be used to query conversion markets, for example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis command will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold. Does that help clarify the purpose of `getcurrencyconverters`?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that makes sense. What are some of the features available when launching a new currency on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen launching a new currency on the Verus network, some of the available features include:\n\n* Maximum participation in one or more currencies\n* Pre-launch discounts\n* Price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies\n* Price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds\n* Pre-launch discounts for early participants\n* Vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs\n\nThese features can help you customize your new currency to fit your needs. Do you have any more questions about launching currencies on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nFinally, what's the benefit of the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, enabling unlimited scale and new use cases. This network enables public blockchains to be merged and staked, as well as private, internal blockchains that can be easily set up and bridged with public currencies. So, in essence, it provides a high degree of flexibility and scalability.",

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. ## Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**   The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'   ``` - **Time Delay:**   The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'   ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ## Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g.
