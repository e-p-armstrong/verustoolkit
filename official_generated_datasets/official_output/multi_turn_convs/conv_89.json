    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the Verus testnet. What makes it unique in the crypto space?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus testnet offers capabilities that go beyond today's decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, including self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable identities (VerusID), which enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. It's truly a game-changer in the crypto space!\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds impressive. Can you tell me more about the capabilities of the new Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet has an easy GUI for basic operations and command line for more advanced functions, allowing users to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming. It enables sending currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease, and even converting currencies to others on the network without an exchange. It's a powerful tool for developers and users alike!\n\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with multi-signature IDs on the testnet. How can I sign transactions from them using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'`.\n2. Get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency` and use it to get the raw hex transaction data with `verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it with `verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>`.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>`.\n\nThat should do the trick! Do you have any more questions about Verus or the testnet?",
