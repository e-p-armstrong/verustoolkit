    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying out the Verus Desktop GUI for the testnet release, and I was wondering about PBaaS chains. What's a limitation of using PBaaS chains in the Verus Desktop GUI for this testnet release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use the same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation will be resolved before mainnet availability. We're still working on improving the GUI, and this is just a temporary restriction.\n\n**User:**\nI saw a disclaimer when I installed the Verus Desktop software. Can you tell me more about what kind of software is being referred to, and what kind of warranty or liability is provided?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software being referred to is the Verus Desktop software, and it's currently experimental and unfinished. The disclaimer states that the software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nI'm using Avast and Kaspersky antivirus software, and they're flagging the Verus Desktop software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that happening?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a common issue! Avast and Kaspersky might flag the Verus Desktop software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it includes mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can find more information about it in the provided resources. Don't worry, the Verus Desktop software is safe to use.",
