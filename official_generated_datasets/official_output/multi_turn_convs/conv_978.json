    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI heard there's a new feature in Verus Desktop v0.9.2 that visualizes the cross-chain network. What is it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's correct! The new feature is a 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on-chain and cross-chain. It allows users to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds amazing! How can I access the 3D cross-chain network visualizer in Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo access the visualizer, click on \u201cVisualize Network\u201d on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop. It's easy to find and use!\n\n**User:**\nWhat's new on the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) capabilities, including those for application development, are now available on the new Verus testnet. This includes capabilities for interoperability, such as the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge, which is expected to be launched soon.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the goal of the new Verus testnet in terms of interoperability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe goal is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge in the near future, which will enable seamless interaction between different blockchain networks.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really exciting! When can we expect to see the Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) features and interoperability capabilities on the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThese new capabilities, including the PBaaS features and interoperability capabilities, will be available on the mainnet soon. We're working hard to get everything ready for you!",
