    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about some new features and technologies coming to Verus. When can I expect to see them on the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThese new features and technologies, along with all the existing ones, will be available on the mainnet soon. Development projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus's transformative technologies can start exploring the Verus testnet now. Do you have any questions about the testnet or its capabilities?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, I do. What new capabilities are available on the Verus testnet, and what is the goal for interoperability on this testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll PBaaS capabilities, including those for application development, are now available on the new Verus testnet. The goal for interoperability on this testnet is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge in the near future. Do you have any further questions about the testnet or its capabilities?\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about a new 3D cross-chain network visualizer in Verus Desktop. How can I access it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo access the new 3D cross-chain network visualizer, simply click on \"Visualize Network\" on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop. Do you have any questions about the visualizer or its features?\n\n**User:**\nI recently updated Verus Desktop to version 0.9.2. I was wondering, what new feature has been added to Verus Desktop in this version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn version 0.9.2 of Verus Desktop, a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer has been added. This visualizer shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on-chain and cross-chain, allowing users to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions. It's a great tool for exploring the Verus ecosystem! Do you have any further questions about Verus Desktop or its features?",
