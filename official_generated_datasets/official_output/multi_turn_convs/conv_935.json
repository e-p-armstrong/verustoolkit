    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a commitment for a new identity on the VRSCTEST chain using the command line. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a commitment for a new identity on the VRSCTEST chain, you can use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registernamecommitment Name youraddressorid referrerfriendlyname@\n```\n\nThis command will respond with a JSON object containing information about the commitment, including the transaction ID, name reservation, and referral information. Do you have any other questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! What do I need to do after creating a commitment for a new identity on the VRSCTEST chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter creating a commitment, you need to wait for the commitment to be mined into a block. Then, you can use the information returned in the commitment response to register the identity using the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registeridentity '{\"txid\":\"...\", \"namereservation\": {... }, \"identity\": {... }}'\n```\n\nReplace the `...` with the actual values from the commitment response. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that does. How can I manage my identities on the VRSCTEST chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can list the identities in your wallet using the `listidentities` command, and display specific identities using the `getidentity` command. If you have the authority, you can also revoke and recover identities as needed. Do you have any more questions about identity management?\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing. What should I do if I have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current update, you should delete the following directories before running the new update:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST` and `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\VerusTest`\n\nThen, you can launch the testnet using the command `./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST`.",
