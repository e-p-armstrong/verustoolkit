    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to learn more about identities in Verus. What are the components of an identity in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach identity in Verus consists of:\n\n1. A set of addresses (one or more)\n2. A minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity\n3. Three special authorities:\n\t* **Primary**: the self-identity that can modify most parts of the identity\n\t* **Revocation**: the identity that can revoke the primary identity, but not spend funds or sign on its behalf\n\t* **Recovery**: the authority that can redefine or recover a revoked identity, but not modify an unrevoked identity\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any further questions about identities in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I do. What is the relationship between an identity and a currency address in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, an identity and a currency address are one and the same. This means that your friendly name can be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer. So, you can think of an identity as a user-friendly name that's tied to a specific address on the Verus blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to funds associated with an identity when it is transferred?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using `z_getbalance identity@`. So, the new owner of the identity will have access to all the funds associated with that identity.\n\n**User:**\nHow can identities be transferred in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIdentities can be transferred by defining them with primary addresses with private keys that are under another party's control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so. This allows for a flexible and secure way to transfer control of an identity.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to transactions sent to an identity when a new address type or signature algorithm is added to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a new address type or signature algorithm, such as a quantum-secure one, is added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well. This means that if you have transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum-secure address will retroactively secure all those transactions under the control of that address. This is a powerful feature that allows Verus to future-proof identities against potential attacks.",

Each identity must have a set of addresses (1 or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. Each identity also refers to two additional identities that have authority over:   - **Primary** - this is the self identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.   - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.   - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all. 3. Identities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party\u2019s control.
