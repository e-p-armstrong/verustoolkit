    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help with any questions about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get started with the Verus CLI. How do I list my available public addresses using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo list your available public addresses using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus listaddressgroupings`. This will show you a list of all your available public addresses.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. I also have a VRSC private key of a R-address that I want to import into my wallet. How do I do that using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo import a VRSC private key of a R-address into your wallet using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus importprivkey \"<PRIVATE_KEY>\"`, replacing `<PRIVATE_KEY>` with your specific private key.\n\n**User:**\nI'd also like to know my current VRSC balance. How do I do that using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo get your current VRSC balance using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus getbalance`. Alternatively, you can use `verus z_gettotalbalance` for more information, or `verus z_getbalance \"<z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>\"` for the balance of a specific address.\n\n**User:**\nI've used `z_sendmany` and `z_shieldcoinbase` commands before, but I'm not sure how to check the status of those operations. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo check the operation status of your `z_sendmany` or `z_shieldcoinbase` command using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus z_getoperationstatus`.\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to send some VRSC coins to another VRSC address. How do I do that using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo send VRSC coins from your Verus wallet to another VRSC address using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus sendtoaddress \"<VRSC_address>\" <AMOUNT> \"<Some comments here>\"`, replacing `<VRSC_address>` with the recipient's address, `<AMOUNT>` with the amount to send, and `<Some comments here>` with optional comments.\n\n**User:**\nI have some reward coins that I'd like to shield from all public addresses. How do I do that using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo shield reward coins from all public addresses using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\" \"<z-ADDRESS>\"`, replacing `<z-ADDRESS>` with the address to shield to.\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to transfer some VRSX from one address to another. How do I do that using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo transfer X VRSX from any (P-, i- and z-) address to any (P-, i- and z-) address using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus z_sendmany \"<z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>\" '[{\"amount\":<X>, \"address\":\"<Z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>\"}]'`, replacing `<z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>` with the source address, `<X>` with the amount to transfer, and `<Z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>` with the destination address.\n\n**User:**\nI'm using the Verus CLI on different operating systems. Are there any differences in how I enter the commands?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are differences. The format for entering Verus CLI commands varies depending on the operating system. On Windows, the commands should be entered without surrounding quotation marks. On Linux and MacOS, the commands should be preceded by `./` without surrounding quotation marks.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. How do I get a new public address using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo get a new public address using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus getnewaddress`.",

So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address, so it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`.##### General remarks on CLI wallet: On Windows command line enter the commands as shown without the surrounding quotation marks In Linux shell preceed the commands without surrounding quotation marks with ./ In MacOS shell preceed the commands without surrounding quotation marks with ./ for example the windows version verus listtransactions transforms in Linux or MacOS to ./verus listtransactions.#####General remarks on Windows command line formatting: The CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS.
