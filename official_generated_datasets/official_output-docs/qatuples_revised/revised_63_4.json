    "VerusIDs can be anything you want. They can be bound digitally to many things. They can be bound to you, or other VerusIDs they have authority or ownership of. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private. Including provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the VerusID itself.VerusIDs can hold funds. They can be personal profiles, corporate websites, or government portals. VerusIDs are much more than identities or today's NFTs. They are owned assets of all kinds on the Verus blockchain.A VerusID can be revoked and recovered, set (time)locks and can be controlled by any number of identities. Sign and verify data, files and messages. VerusID has privacy through added z-addresses and can send and receive messages. Identities can communicate in standardized ways through the novel [Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF)](/vdxf/README).## Real Estate A VerusID is **premium** real estate on the Verus blockchain. To create PBaaS-chains, tokens and currencies on the Verus blockchain, a VerusID is necessary. The name you assign to the VerusID is also the name of the PBaaS-chain, token or currency.Each PBaaS-chain has standard VerusID support and creators of these chains can assign the costs of identites themselves. The costs will then be paid in the native coin of the PBaaS-chain.## Friendly Name Each VerusID can have an easy to remember name, chosen by the user. It has never been easier to send and receive funds.::: tip Supporting Worldwide Adoption All characters from **all character sets** (except ``/`` ``:`` ``*`` ``?`` ``\"`` ``<`` ``>`` ``|`` ``@`` ``.`` ) are available to create a VerusID. :::## Costs **On the Verus blockchain** a VerusID costs 100 VRSC.
