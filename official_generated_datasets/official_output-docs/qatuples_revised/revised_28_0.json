    "What is the block reward structure of the Verus blockchain, and how does it change over time?",
    "The block reward structure of the Verus blockchain changes over time, with decreasing block rewards at certain block heights. The block rewards are halved at specific intervals, with the first halving occurring at block height 10,080. The block rewards continue to decrease until they reach a minimum of 0.00292968 VRSC at block height 13,901,040 and beyond. The maximum circulating supply of all coins is capped at 83,540,184 VRSC.",

The last of those rewards were unlocked at block height 1,181,520. ::: ## Block Fees Fees are generated from users paying for services and interacting with the protocol. These fees are processed in the blocks and earned by miners and stakers. | Protocol Activity | Fees | | :------------- | -------------:| | VerusID Registration | 20 - 100 VRSC | | PBaaS-chain Launch| 10,000 VRSC** | | Currency/Token Launch | 200 VRSC | | Conversion Fee | 0.025%, 0.05% | | Transaction Fee | 0.0001 VRSC  | _**Half the fee (5000) goes to the miners and stakers of the newly launched PBaaS-chain._ ## Fee Pool All the fees generated by the protocol are collected in the ``fee pool``. With each new block, ``1%`` of the fee pool is added on top of the block rewards. It is expected that fees outnumber block rewards, making mining and staking in the Verus ecosystem a profitable and competitive endeavor.",
