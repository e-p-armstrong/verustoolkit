    "Why is serialization and deserialization important in VerusPay invoices?",
    "Serialization and deserialization are important in VerusPay invoices because they enable a standardized approach to converting the VerusPay Invoice and VerusPay InvoiceDetails into a binary format (serialization) and back (deserialization) to ensure efficient transmission and storage. This process ensures that invoices can be shared, processed, and stored across different systems and languages without loss of fidelity or meaning.",
    "- **VERUSPAY_INVALID (0)**: Indicates that the invoice is invalid. This default state can be used to signify that an invoice should not be processed. - **VERUSPAY_VALID (1)**: Signifies that the invoice is valid and can be processed. This flag must be set for the invoice to be considered actionable. - **VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_CONVERSION (2)**: Specifies that the invoice accepts currency conversions. This allows payments in different currencies, with conversion to the invoice's requested currency. If an invoice accepts conversion, it requires a max estimated slippage value. - **VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_NON_VERUS_SYSTEMS (4)**: Indicates that payments from non-Verus blockchain systems are accepted. If this flag is set, specifying accepted systems is required. - **VERUSPAY_EXPIRES (8)**: Determines that the invoice has an expiry condition. If set, the invoice must be paid before a specific Verus blockchain height is reached, and an expiry height must be set. - **VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_ANY_DESTINATION (16)**: Allows the invoice to accept payments to any destination. If set, the destination field in the invoice must be left blank. - **VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_ANY_AMOUNT (32)**: Indicates that the invoice can be paid with any amount. This is useful for donations or when the exact payment amount is not fixed. If set, the amount field in the invoice must be left blank. - **VERUSPAY_EXCLUDES_VERUS_BLOCKCHAIN (64)**: If set, invoice cannot be paid on VRSC/VRSCTEST. - **VERUSPAY_IS_TESTNET (128)**: Marks the invoice as only valid on VRSCTEST and/or testnet PBaaS blockchains, and establishes that all currencies/identities referenced within the invoice exist only on testnet.## Serialization and Deserialization![veruspay-invoice-bytes](/images/veruspay-invoice-bytes.svg)The specification emphasizes a standardized approach to converting the VerusPay Invoice and VerusPay InvoiceDetails into a binary format (serialization) and back (deserialization) to enable efficient transmission and storage.
