    "What are simple token currencies in Verus DeFi, and what are their characteristics?",
    "Simple token currencies are currencies without any reserves. They can support a lot of use cases, especially with the ability to add parameters, create subIDs, and use decentralized crowdfund mechanisms. The supply of decentralized simple token currencies is static, while centralized ones can be minted by the owner of the rootID and burned by anyone.",
    "| Conversion type | Fee | Fee goes to | | :-----| :------ | :-------- | | Basket currency \u2194\ufe0f reserve | 0.025% | 0.0125% added to reserves of the basket currency, 0.0125% to the block reward for miners and stakers | | Reserve \u2194\ufe0f reserve | 0.05% | 0.025% added to reserves of the basket currency, 0.025% to the block reward for miners and stakers |Because all currency conversions are solved simultaneously inside a block, giving all participants the same price, the protocol is MEV-free (no front-running, back-running, sandwich attacks etc.). The protocol doesn\u2019t have any of the problems EVM-like account-based systems have. Verus DeFi is fair, cheap and has no rent-seekers.Every(!) currency and token on the Verus network (also mapped ERC-20s!), can be used as reserves for basket currencies. As you might start to understand now \u2014 basket currencies are unique currencies that can not be found anywhere else and offer an enormous amount of opportunities for value creation.## Simple token currencies Simple token currencies and are just currencies without any reserves. They are not as exciting as the basket currencies, yet still offer much value. With all the parameters that can be added, subIDs created and decentralized crowdfund mechanisms, these currencies can support a lot of use cases that are difficult to do with alternative protocols.The supply of this type of currency is static when it\u2019s a decentralized version. When it\u2019s a centralized version, the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn them.This option is also used to create currencies that are mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s. Which means you can send those ERC-20s over to Verus, or from Verus to the ERC-20. This is made possible with the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge. You can read more about it here.And of course, a simple token currency can be one of the reserves in a basket currency.## Ethereum ERC-20 The Verus-Ethereum Bridge makes it possible for currencies and tokens to be send over to Ethereum, and back to Verus. It is a true non-custodial bridge. All tokens and currencies flowing over the bridge are never in anyone\u2019s custody, and are proven and verified by consensus rules.
