    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to learn more about invoices in Verus. What are the main components of an invoice in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main components of an invoice in Verus include:\n- Flags (configurable flag bits for invoice options)\n- Amount (the payment amount specified in the invoice)\n- Destination (details about the payment destination, using the TransferDestination construct)\n- Requested Currency ID (the identifier for the currency in which the payment is requested)\n- Expiry Height (optional, specifies a Verus blockchain height after which the invoice is considered expired)\n- Max Estimated Slippage (defines the acceptable slippage for currency conversions, if applicable)\n- Accepted Systems (lists blockchain systems or platforms accepted for payment other than VRSC/VRSCTEST)\n\nThese components work together to ensure a smooth and secure payment process. Do you have any specific questions about these components or how they're used in an invoice?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What does the \"Destination\" component in an invoice represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"Destination\" component in an invoice represents details about the payment destination, utilizing the TransferDestination construct for flexibility across different types of destinations. This allows for a high degree of customization and compatibility with various payment scenarios.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the \"Destination\" component or any other aspect of invoices in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question about invoices. What is the purpose of the \"Expiry Height\" component in an invoice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"Expiry Height\" component in an invoice optionally specifies a Verus blockchain height after which the invoice is considered expired. This allows the invoice to have a limited validity period, ensuring that payments are made within a certain timeframe. This can be useful for preventing old or stale invoices from being used, and adds an extra layer of security to the payment process.",
