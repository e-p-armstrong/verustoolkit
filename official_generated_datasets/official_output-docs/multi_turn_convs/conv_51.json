    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand more about defining a currency on Verus. Specifically, I'd like to know what the \"minpreconversion\" parameter is used for.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"minpreconversion\" parameter is used to set a minimum amount of preconversions required for a currency to launch. If the minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who preconverted will get their funds back, minus transaction and conversion fees. There is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting, which should be considered when trying to meet the minimum amount.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the \"maxpreconversion\" parameter? How does that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"maxpreconversion\" parameter is used to set a maximum amount of preconversions allowed during the preconversion time frame. If the maximum amount is exceeded, everything above it will be automatically refunded after the currency is launched. This helps to prevent excessive preconversions and maintain a healthy balance.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And what about the \"initialcontributions\" parameter? What's that used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"initialcontributions\" parameter allows the rootID to contribute some or all of the minimum preconversions directly as part of the currency definition. This parameter is used to make an initial contribution to either the reserves when it\u2019s a basket currency (`options:33`), or to the rootID when it\u2019s a simple token currency (`options:32`). The funds to initially contribute need to be in the rootID when defining the currency. After the preconversion time frame is over and the currency launched, the rootID has received an amount of the launched currency. Does that clarify things for you?",

The minimum amount of preconversions needs to be met or the currency will not launch and everyone gets their conversions returned, minus the transaction and conversion fees. It works both with basket currencies and simple token currencies.There is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting. Take this into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.Example currency: ``` json ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{  \"name\":\"CompanyX\",  \"options\":32,  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],  \"conversions\":[2],  \"minpreconversion\":[500] }' ``` \u261d\ufe0f This simple token currency is called CompanyX. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert at least 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 250 CompanyX, or more when more is converted. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds back.### **\"maxpreconversion\"** Use this parameter to set a maximum amount of preconversions. During the preconversion time frame the amount set can not be exceeded. Everything above this amount will be automatically refunded after the currency is launched.Example currency: ``` json ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{  \"name\":\"CoinCommunity\",  \"options\":33,  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],  \"maxpreconversion\":[100],  \"initialsupply\":100 }' ``` \u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called CoinCommunity. During the preconversion time frame people can convert VRSCTEST into its reserves for 100 CoinCommunity in return. During the preconversion time frame there can not be more than 100 VRSCTEST converted into its reserves. Whatever is preconverted more will be returned.### **\"initialcontributions\"** The rootID can contribute some or all of the minimum preconversions directly as part of the currency definition.
