    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in staking on the Verus network. What is staking in the context of Verus, and what are the benefits of participating in it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the context of Verus, staking refers to the process of using Verus holdings to secure the network. Anyone can participate in staking, regardless of the amount of $VRSC they have, as there are no minimum requirements to start. By staking, users can help secure the network and potentially earn rewards. Would you like to know more about staking on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. I've heard that UTXOs are staked, not balances. What's the difference between staking balances and staking UTXOs on the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn the Verus blockchain, UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) are staked, not balances. This means that a large UTXO has more chances of winning a block than a small UTXO. So, when you're staking, it's the individual UTXOs that matter, not the total balance in your wallet. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nGot it! I think I understand. What are the rules for solo staking on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo participate in solo staking on the Verus network, you need to follow these rules:\n\n1. Your wallet must be running.\n2. You must have a full node running in native mode (available in Verus Desktop).\n3. Staking must be enabled.\n4. Your UTXO must be eligible after 150 blocks.\n5. You must have a minimum of 0.00000001 VRSC in your wallet.\n\nMake sure to follow these rules to participate in solo staking successfully. Do you have any more questions about solo staking?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I think that's clear. What about pool staking? What are the two ways to participate in pool staking with Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are two ways to participate in pool staking with Verus:\n\n1. Keep control over your funds by using VerusID in combination with a staking pool.\n2. Send your coins to a pool operator and trust your funds with them. Note that this option involves giving up control over your funds.\n\nSo, you can choose to participate in pool staking while maintaining control over your funds or entrust your funds to a pool operator. Do you have any more questions about pool staking?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. Can you give me an example of a non-custodial staking pool for Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAn example of a non-custodial staking pool for Verus is Synergy Pool (https://synergopool.io). They allow you to stake your Verus coins while keeping control over your funds. Make sure to do your own research and due diligence before choosing a staking pool.",
