            "Why would I need to claim refunds on the Verus-Ethereum Bridge?",
            "You may need to claim refunds on the Verus-Ethereum Bridge because the Ethereum gas fees can change dramatically in a short period of time. If the gas fees increase after you pay for a bridge crossing, you may be eligible for a refund.",
            "# Claim refunds on the Verus-Ethereum Bridge Crossing the bridge costs Ethereum gas fees. Gas fees can swing in price quite dramatically in a short period of time. It can happen that when you pay for a bridge crossing the gas fees jumped up higher than what you paid for the crossing, resulting in a refund. Learn here how you can claim your refunds back. ## Ethereum to Ethereum When using the Bridge website and making a conversion that goes from Ethereum to Verus and back to Ethereum, you have signed a message that created a refund address based on your Ethereum wallet's private key. These are the steps to claim refunds when you did an Ethereum to Ethereum transaction: ### Verus Mobile 1. Export your Ethereum private key from the wallet you did the conversion with (probably MetaMask) 2. Import that private key into a Verus wallet. The easiest way to do that is with Verus Mobile. - Download Verus Mobile on the Play Store or App Store - Add a new profile (choose username and password) - Choose \"import wallet\" - Choose \"Enter key/seed\" - Enter the Ethereum private key here - Add the currency you want to get back (click the plus-button corner-right, \"Add PBaaS currency\" and choose the one for you) ### Verus Desktop If you are running native mode (full node) Verus Desktop then you can import the Ethereum's private key in this way: Go to ``Settings (gear-icon top right)``, then ``Coin Settings``, then select the Verus blockchain and type the following: ```json run importprivkey \"ETH_PRIVATE_KEY\" \"\" true ``` ::: warning Important! Verus Desktop will not show any progress on the import. It will take some time for the process to finish in the background. ::: ## Verus to Ethereum When bridging with Verus Desktop from the Verus blockchain to the Ethereum blockchain you had to fill in a refund address. On the Bridge website you can use that refund address to claim the funds back.",
