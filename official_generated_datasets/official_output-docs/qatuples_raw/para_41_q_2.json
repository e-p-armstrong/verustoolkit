    "What is the \"makeoffer\" RPC API used for in Verus?",
    "The \"makeoffer\" RPC API is used to define what you offer (funds, VerusIDs, or currencies) and what you want in return (funds, VerusIDs, or currencies) for a specific VerusID or asset.",
    "In addition to advertising worldwide on the blockchain to buy or sell VerusIDs, you can also make an exchange with the Marketplace without ever posting the offer on the blockchain until it is agreed and signed by all parties. Combine that with zero knowledge transactions, and it's a great way to transact worldwide, escrow-free in private. :::tip Use Case Example A business sells subscriptions for exclusive content. They make VerusIDs with contracts that give access to the exclusive content. They now create a transaction that would pay for the VerusID. They give the transaction to the buyer who then executes it. The buyer now owns the VerusID that gives access to the exclusive content. ::: Now imagine how you can do this for a VerusID that can be any kind of asset. A new way for everyone to engage in peer-to-peer, escrow-free commerce has arrived. ### RPC APIs | API | What it does | | :- |:-----| | makeoffer | define what you offer and for what. What you offer can be funds, VerusIDs, or when PBaaS goes live even other currencies. What you want in return can also be funds, VerusIDs or currencies. In exchange for what you offer, you also define what VerusID or how much you want for it and in what currency | | takeoffer | take a specific offer in exchange for its request | | getoffers | specify which VerusID or currency you want to see offers for or on offer, and it returns all offers (buy and sell) in all currencies, sorted by highest to lowest price | | closeoffers | close expired or unexpired offers which you opened with makeoffer | | listopenoffers | list all offers that you have opened with makeoffer | ## Privacy A VerusID can contain a pointer to a ``z-address``. These are private addresses that can not be checked on the public blockchain. Attach any z-address to a VerusID. ## Signatures Create unforgable, verifiable signatures with VerusID. Sign files, hashes and messages. Use the protocol to verify those signatures for free. ## Multisig Multiple VerusIDs can have spending or signing ability of one VerusID. This means that multiple organizations or people can manage a VerusID. ## Messages Send private messages to VerusIDs.",
