    "What is the Verus-Ethereum Bridge, and what are its key features?",
    "The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is a trustless and non-custodial bridge that allows for the secure transfer and conversion of cryptocurrencies between Verus and Ethereum. It doesn't require users to trust a third party with their funds, and no single entity has control over the assets being transferred. This bridge stands out from others because it uses the decentralized network of miners and stakers to verify and account for funds crossing the bridge, avoiding common security issues.",
    "# What is the Verus-Ethereum Bridge The Verus-Ethereum Bridge (fully operational since Oct 20, 2023) allows for the secure transfer and conversion of cryptocurrencies between Verus and Ethereum. It's **trustless** and **non-custodial**, meaning it doesn't require users to trust a third party with their funds, and **no single entity has control over the assets being transferred**.The Bridge stands out because it avoids common security issues found in other cryptocurrency bridges by using the decentralized network of miners and stakers to verify and account for funds crossing the bridge.\ud83d\udc49 Access the Verus-Ethereum Bridge [with MetaMask or WalletConnect](https://eth.verusbridge.io), or download Verus Mobile for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/en/app/verus-mobile/id6447361908) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.autonomoussoftwarefoundation.verusmobile.android&hl=en&gl=US).## What can the Verus-Ethereum Bridge do The trustless and non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge can be used for the following things:| What       |     Details      | | :------------------ | :----------------------------------------- | | **Conversions**| Convert VRSC, ETH (vETH), DAI (DAI.vETH) & MKR (MKR.vETH) with each other into any direction (on/to Verus & Ethereum), or to and from the Bridge.vETH currency.| | **Launch mapped currencies**| Launch currencies on Verus that are 1:1 mapped to any ERC-20. [Learn how](/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html)| | **Export currencies as ERC-20**| Export any launched currency (simple tokens, basket currencies) on Verus as an ERC-20. [Learn how](/currencies/export-to-eth.html)| | **Cross-chain sends**| Send any tokens, basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools), mapped currencies etc. that are exported to Ethereum across the bridge.| | **Export tokenized ID control**| Export a tokenized VerusID to Ethereum as ERC-721.| | **Map VerusID to Ethereum NFT**| Launch a tokenized ID with a mapping of an Ethereum ERC-721 or ERC-1155.|Then there is the bridge currency Bridge.vETH, a 100% backed currency with 4 currencies in its reserves (VRSC, ETH, DAI, MKR). The Bridge.vETH currency function is to make the bridging of assets simple. From wherever you send it converts the fees that you need seamlessly.
