    "What is MEV-resistance in the context of Verus DeFi?",
    "MEV-resistance in Verus DeFi refers to the protocol's design, which prevents Miner Extractable Value (MEV) exploits. This means that every participant gets the same, fair conversion rate in one or more blocks, without front/back running.",
    "# Introduction Verus DeFi is incredibly simple, low-cost, MEV-resistant and without any middleman. You can convert into a currency that has reserves (you are now \"providing liquidity\"), and you can convert out of the currency again, back into its reserves. Furthermore you can convert from reserve to reserve.

All smart capabilities are implemented on the protocol level. This has many advantages over blockchain projects that use layer two solutions. [Read \"Smart Transactions vs. Smart Contracts\"](https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-smart-transactions-vs-smart-contracts-f98079c00ed0)Advantages of DeFi at the protocol level:* Increased security at the application level - Verus DeFi is not implemented by having many smart contract authors creating smart contracts on top of the protocol, so there can be no exploits by searching for unintended \"cracks\" in the seams between contracts.* Increased security at the protocol level - Verus DeFi is implemented in the protocol as part of the consensus, following the fundamental systems design principle which says that the most important security layers should be located in the system/protocol itself.## MEV-resistance",
