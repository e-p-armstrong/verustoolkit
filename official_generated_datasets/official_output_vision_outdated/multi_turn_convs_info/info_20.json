            "Verus enables humans to share and expose human knowledge through voting mechanisms to make decisions, express opinions, and classify accurately. This process provides an ideal source of training data for machine learning systems across any domain of human knowledge or opinion.",

The data used for that classification, as well as the classifications or decisions themselves provide an ideal source of training\ndata for machine learning systems across any domain of human knowledge or opinion. As\ncorporations gather, sequester, and learn from massive amounts of personal data in order to\ncompete and boost their bottom line, rather than accrue to society\u2019s benefit, these massive\nprivate databases serve to affect and influence human populations by knowing more about\nthem than others, or even than they know about themselves.\nSince Verus enables humans to use voting mechanisms to classify and make decisions,\nand stores the results of this process in IPFS and on the blockchain, we will train machine\nlearning algorithms on these results over time, allowing them to eventually classify and make\ndecisions consistent with human decisions and values at an even higher scale. This will enable\nVerus to perform certain tasks automatically, such as the recognition of false or incorrect\nidentification data among participants in the system, the initial classification or rating of\ncertain content that can be overruled, but may not be appropriate for all audiences, and much\nmore. The end result of this is a more secure and trustworthy network, built on consensus\nand trustless principles, leveraging worldwide human knowledge as a base of information and\nmachines for scale.\n17",
