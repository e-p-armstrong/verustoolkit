    "Verus plans to support traditional identity systems, such as biometric and government-issued IDs, via centralized or decentralized verification. This will enable the use of Verus identities in situations that require conformance to KYC regulations, while still providing a decentralized and secure identity management system.",
    "r\n\nEach identity will have its own, unique address. Unless its owner reveals information\nto link two or more identities, it is cryptographically hard \u2013 meaning virtually impossible\n\u2013 to correlate one identity to another. At the same time, the owner of an identity can still\ncryptographically verify statements made about identities under their control, attesting to\nidentity properties (such as passport, age, height, citizenship, photo, etc.) as strongly as\nis possible with today\u2019s digital technology. As part of the Verus vision, to be described in\nmore detail in later phases, we intend to support fully decentralized verification of identities\nthat can provide as strong verification as today\u2019s centralized systems. At the same time, we\nbelieve it is important for practical reasons to enable compatibility with centralized forms of\nidentity and to enable people to optionally support KYC in identities. To enable a smooth\nbridge between centralized and decentralized identity systems, today\u2019s ID systems, including\nbiometric and government issued IDs, will be supported via centralized or decentralized\nverification to enable use of Verus identity in situations that require conformance to knowyour-customer (KYC) regul",
