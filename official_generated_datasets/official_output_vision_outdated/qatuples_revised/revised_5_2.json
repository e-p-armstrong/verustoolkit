    "What is the main concern related to online privacy?",
    "The main concern is the exploitation of online privacy, which is used to extract value from individuals, influence their behavior, and affect their decision-making. This is often done by presenting information in a way that takes advantage of human psychology, in order to persuade individuals to buy certain products or support certain agendas.",
    "About This Document\nThis vision paper is not intended as a technical reference, but as a vehicle to communicate\nour vision, our plans, and our thinking \u2013 as we work on realizing the true potential of Verus.\nAll technologies described are based on a clear understanding of methods intended to\nimplement each solution but \u2013 as with any project \u2013 the specific implementation details will\nbe refined as we actually realize their functionality. To supplement this vision paper, we\nwill follow soon after its initial release with a white paper, describing the new technologies\ndeveloped for Verus Coin\u2019s initial launch, what benefits they provide, and provide details of\ntheir implementation. We will continue to supplement this vision paper with white papers,\nas appropriate, for each completed phase of Verus Coin\u2019s development, in the future.\nAs of this point, we have completed Phase 1, having released Verus Coin with zero\nknowledge privacy, two brand new algorithms combined for simultaneous CPU-mineable\nproof of work (POW) and fair proof of stake (POS) consensus, in-wallet mining and staking\non PCs, leverage of and support for advanced Komodo platform technologies, and wallets\nand miners for every major PC operating system.\n\n2\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nInformation vies for our attention in today\u2019s digital world, trying to convince us of what\nproduct to use or which politician to believe. We are watched and measured as we react to\nthat information, in order to convince us what to buy or to believe. This is an active process\nthat exploits our lack of online privacy \u2013 combined with weaknesses in human psychology \u2013\nin order to make profit; extracting value from, even affecting our behavior, learning about\nand influencing each of us individually to open our wallets or add our voices to another\u2019s\nagenda.\nNo single person can digest and fully understand \u2013 let alone verify \u2013 a fraction of the\ninformation ",
