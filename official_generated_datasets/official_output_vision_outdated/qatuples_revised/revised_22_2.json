    "June 12, 2018\nAbstract\nThe Verus Project aims to establish a secure, privacy-centric, fairly-distributed\ncryptocurrency. But \u2013 beyond this currency \u2013 Verus seeks to become much more than\na zero-knowledge privacy coin, one with two completely new highly-decentralizing proof\nof work and proof of stake algorithms.\nIn addition to payments, decentralization, and privacy features, Verus Project\nplans include its direct use as a currency for provisioning scalable and secure public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), for Verus applications built upon these parallel\nchains to scale. What this will do is simple: It will enable all people \u2013 as well as\nall nodes on the Verus network to participate in and benefit from a decentralized,\nblockchain service economy.\nThis paper details the Verus vision and describes the function of Verus as its own\nplatform, and also as a member of the Komodo platform ecosystem, in the context of its\nfirst applications. Verus core applications will provide a foundation to build additional\napplications and services, which will leverage Verus\u2019 automatically created blockchains,\ncalled autochains. Autochains \u2013 or PBaaS \u2013 will be provisioned and notarized by the\nVerus blockchain miners and stakers, in exchange for Verus currency.\nAutochains will be validated through proof-of-stake by their user populations. In\naddition to extremely scalable, dynamic, publicly-secured autochain applications, this\nwill add a dynamic isolation and security component to applications that can also\ncreate, manage, and verify transactions on the main Verus chain or any other Komodocompatible, Crypto-Conditions [17], Interledger Protocol [25] enabled blockchains.\nThe ways we apply this technology to our world \u2013 to our biggest contemporary\nchallenges \u2013 has the potential to completely remake the fabric of our society.1",
