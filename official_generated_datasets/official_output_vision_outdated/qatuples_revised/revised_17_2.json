    "Can mobile phones currently generate zk-SNARK transactions?",
    "No, currently, based on standard smartphone hardware specifications and the memory requirements of zk-SNARK transactions, mobile phones cannot generate z-transactions.",
    "There is a fair amount of confusion among the public about privacy on the blockchain. One\ncommon belief is that Bitcoin transactions are private, when in fact all Bitcoin transactions,\nas well as the public addresses between which value is transferred, are public information [21].\nAs with the Verus token and its blockchain, poll autochains will also support zk-SNARKs\nto ensure that votes which have not been disclosed by a voter remain provably anonymous\nto all other parties, while still being verifiable by the person who holds the keys to the\naddress that cast them. Currently, based on standard smartphone hardware specifications\nand the memory requirements of zk-SNARK transactions, mobile phones cannot generate\nz-transactions. In coming releases of new Zcash technology this year, the z-transactions will\nbe more efficient and still provide the same privacy guarantees. When these technologies\nare available, we will work to support them on the Verus chain, as well as use the increased\nefficiency to enable z-transactions and all Verus features on mobile devices as soon as possible. Until that is available, we will work to provide a mobile wallet for Verus transparent\ntransactions.\n3.3.7Content Classification",
