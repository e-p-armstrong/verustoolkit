    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been wondering about privacy in cryptocurrency transactions. Are Bitcoin transactions private?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, Bitcoin transactions, as well as the public addresses between which value is transferred, are public information. This lack of privacy is a concern for many users. Do you have any other questions about privacy in cryptocurrency transactions?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, I do. How does Verus plan to ensure the privacy of votes on poll autochains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus plans to support zk-SNARKs on poll autochains to ensure that votes which have not been disclosed by a voter remain provably anonymous to all other parties, while still being verifiable by the person who holds the keys to the address that cast them. This technology allows for privacy while maintaining the integrity of the voting process.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. But can mobile phones currently generate zk-SNARK transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, currently, based on standard smartphone hardware specifications and the memory requirements of zk-SNARK transactions, mobile phones cannot generate z-transactions. The computational requirements are just too high for current mobile devices.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the plan for supporting zk-SNARK transactions on mobile devices?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus will work to support zk-SNARK transactions on mobile devices as soon as possible, once new Zcash technology releases become available, which will make z-transactions more efficient while still providing the same privacy guarantees. Until then, Verus will focus on providing a mobile wallet for Verus transparent transactions. We're committed to making private transactions accessible to everyone, regardless of the device they use.",
