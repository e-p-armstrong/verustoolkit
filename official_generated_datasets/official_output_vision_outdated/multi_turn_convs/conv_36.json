    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how the Verus system uses randomized selection for its functions. Can you explain that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus system uses blockchain lotteries for randomized selection, similar to its Phase I PoS block validation system. This is used for selecting participants in randomized polls and other cases where pseudo-random sampling is desired. It's a fascinating approach, and I'd be happy to dive deeper if you'd like.\n\n**User:**\nActually, I'd love to know more about the principle behind Verus lotteries. What makes them tick?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe principle behind Verus lotteries is that they use the blockchain as a random oracle, and are based on the assumption that the exact value of a specific block hash from a past block in the chain cannot be modified by a byzantine participant to weigh the odds in their favor. This ensures a high degree of randomness and fairness in the selection process.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. Are there different methods that can be used for selection in Verus lotteries?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are two possible methods that can be used for selection in Verus lotteries. One method is similar to Algorand, which guarantees selection, and the other is an original Verus algorithm based on difficulty, such as Verus PoS. Both methods offer unique advantages and can be used depending on the specific use case. Do you have any more questions about Verus lotteries or randomized selection?",
