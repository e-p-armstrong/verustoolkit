    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    How can you use the `listunspent` command in Verus to retrieve a list of unspent
    transaction outputs, and what are the different ways to specify the parameters
    for this command?


    **ANSWER:**

    The `listunspent` command in Verus is used to retrieve a list of unspent transaction
    outputs (UTXOs) that can be used to create new transactions. This command can
    be used in different ways to specify the parameters for retrieving the UTXOs.


    **Basic usage:**

    The basic usage of the `listunspent` command is by simply running `verus listunspent`.
    This will retrieve a list of all unspent transaction outputs in the wallet.


    **Specifying minimum and maximum confirmations:**

    You can specify the minimum and maximum number of confirmations required for the
    UTXOs by adding two integer parameters to the command. For example, `verus listunspent
    6 9999999` will retrieve a list of UTXOs with at least 6 confirmations and at
    most 9999999 confirmations.


    **Specifying addresses:**

    You can also specify a list of addresses to retrieve UTXOs for by adding a JSON
    array of addresses as a parameter to the command. For example, `verus listunspent
    6 9999999 "["RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV","RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV"]"`
    will retrieve a list of UTXOs with at least 6 confirmations and at most 9999999
    confirmations for the specified addresses.


    **Using JSON-RPC:**

    The `listunspent` command can also be used with JSON-RPC by sending a JSON request
    to the Verus daemon. The JSON request should contain the method `listunspent`,
    the parameters for the command, and a request ID. For example, the following command
    can be used to retrieve a list of UTXOs using JSON-RPC:

    ```

    curl --user myusername --data-binary ''{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method":
    "listunspent", "params": [6, 9999999, ["RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV","RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV"]]}''
    -H ''content-type: text/plain;'' http://127.0.0.1:27486/

    ```

    This will send a JSON request to the Verus daemon to retrieve a list of UTXOs
    with at least 6 confirmations and at most 9999999 confirmations for the specified
    addresses.'

    **User:**

    Hey, I''m trying to understand how to use the `listunspent` command in Verus.
    Can you explain how to use it to retrieve a list of unspent transaction outputs,
    and what are the different ways to specify the parameters for this command?


    **AI Assistant:**

    The `listunspent` command in Verus is a powerful tool for retrieving a list of
    unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) that can be used to create new transactions.
    This command can be used in different ways to specify the parameters for retrieving
    the UTXOs.


    Let''s start with the basic usage. If you simply run `verus listunspent`, it will
    retrieve a list of all unspent transaction outputs in the wallet.


    But what if you want to specify certain conditions for the UTXOs? For example,
    you might want to retrieve UTXOs with a certain number of confirmations. You can
    do this by adding two integer parameters to the command. For instance, `verus
    listunspent 6 9999999` will retrieve a list of UTXOs with at least 6 confirmations
    and at most 9999999 confirmations.


    Another way to specify parameters is by specifying a list of addresses to retrieve
    UTXOs for. You can do this by adding a JSON array of addresses as a parameter
    to the command. For example, `verus listunspent 6 9999999 "["RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV","RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV"]"`
    will retrieve a list of UTXOs with at least 6 confirmations and at most 9999999
    confirmations for the specified addresses.


    If you''re using JSON-RPC, you can also use the `listunspent` command by sending
    a JSON request to the Verus daemon. The JSON request should contain the method
    `listunspent`, the parameters for the command, and a request ID. For example,
    the following command can be used to retrieve a list of UTXOs using JSON-RPC:

    ```

    curl --user myusername --data-binary ''{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method":
    "listunspent", "params": [6, 9999999, ["RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV","RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV"]]}''
    -H ''content-type: text/plain;'' http://127.0.0.1:27486/

    ```

    This will send a JSON request to the Verus daemon to retrieve a list of UTXOs
    with at least 6 confirmations and at most 9999999 confirmations for the specified
    addresses.


    Do you have any more questions about using the `listunspent` command in Verus?'
