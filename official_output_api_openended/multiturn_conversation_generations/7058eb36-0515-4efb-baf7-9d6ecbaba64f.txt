    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    What are the different properties and settings that can be configured when defining
    a currency on the Verus platform, and what do they control?


    **ANSWER:**

    When defining a currency on the Verus platform, there are several properties and
    settings that can be configured to control various aspects of the currency''s
    behavior. Here are some of the key properties and settings:


    **Currency Weights:** This property is only returned for a liquidity basket and
    represents the relative weights of each currency in the basket.


    **Conversions:** This property specifies the pre-launch conversion rates for non-fractional
    currencies. It is an array of numbers, where each number represents the conversion
    rate for a specific currency.


    **Minpreconversion:** This property specifies the minimum amounts required in
    pre-conversions for a currency to launch. It is an array of numbers, where each
    number represents the minimum amount required for a specific currency.


    **Currencies:** This property specifies the currencies that can be converted to
    this currency at launch or that make up a liquidity basket. It is an array of
    string addresses, where each address represents a currency.


    **Currencynames:** This property is an object that maps i-addresses to fully qualified
    names of all sub-currencies.


    **Initialsupply:** This property specifies the initial currency supply for fractional
    currencies before preallocation or issuance. It is a number that represents the
    total supply of the currency.


    **Prelaunchcarveout:** This property specifies the pre-launch percentage of proceeds
    for fractional currency sent to the launching ID. It is a number that represents
    the percentage of proceeds.


    **Preallocations:** This property specifies the VerusIDs and amounts for pre-allocation
    at launch. It is an array of objects, where each object contains an i-address
    and an amount.


    **Initialcontributions:** This property specifies the amounts of pre-conversions
    reserved for the launching ID. It is an array of numbers, where each number represents
    the amount reserved for a specific currency.


    **Idregistrationfees:** This property specifies the base cost of IDs for this
    currency namespace in this currency. It is a number that represents the cost of
    ID registration.


    **Idreferrallevels:** This property specifies the levels of ID referrals (only
    for native PBaaS chains and IDs). It is an integer that represents the number
    of referral levels.


    **Idimportfees:** This property specifies the fees required to import an ID to
    this system (only for native PBaaS chains and IDs). It is a number that represents
    the import fee.


    **Eras:** This property specifies different chain phases of rewards and convertibility.
    It is an array of objects, where each object represents an era and contains properties
    such as reward, decay, halving, and eraend.


    **Era Properties:**


    * **Reward:** This property specifies the reward start for each era in native
    coin. It is an array of integers, where each integer represents the reward for
    a specific era.

    * **Decay:** This property specifies the exponential or linear decay of rewards
    during each era. It is an array of integers, where each integer represents the
    decay rate for a specific era.

    * **Halving:** This property specifies the blocks between halvings during each
    era. It is an array of integers, where each integer represents the halving interval
    for a specific era.

    * **Eraend:** This property specifies the block marking the end of each era. It
    is an array of integers, where each integer represents the block number at which
    an era ends.


    These properties and settings allow for a high degree of customization and control
    over the behavior of a currency on the Verus platform.'
