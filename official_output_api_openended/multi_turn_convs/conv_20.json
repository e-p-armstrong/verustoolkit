    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having trouble with sending VRSC to a specific address using the `sendtoaddress` command in Verus. Can you explain how to use this command and what are the optional parameters that can be used with it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendtoaddress` command in Verus is used to send a specific amount of VRSC to a given address. The basic syntax of the command is `sendtoaddress \"VRSC_address\" amount`. The \"VRSC_address\" is the address of the recipient, and the \"amount\" is the quantity of VRSC to be sent.\n\nThe `sendtoaddress` command has several optional parameters that can be used to customize the transaction. These parameters include:\n\n* \"comment\" (string, optional): This parameter allows you to add a comment to the transaction, which will be stored in your wallet. This comment is not part of the transaction itself, but rather a note for your own reference.\n* \"comment-to\" (string, optional): This parameter allows you to add a comment to the transaction that specifies the name of the person or organization to which you're sending the transaction. Like the \"comment\" parameter, this is not part of the transaction itself, but rather a note for your own reference.\n* subtractfeefromamount (boolean, optional, default=false): This parameter specifies whether the transaction fee should be deducted from the amount being sent. If set to true, the recipient will receive less VRSC than the amount specified in the \"amount\" parameter.\n\nWhen you use the `sendtoaddress` command, Verus will return a \"transactionid\" string, which is the ID of the transaction.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `sendtoaddress` command:\n\n* `verus sendtoaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 0.1`: This command sends 0.1 VRSC to the specified address.\n* `verus sendtoaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 0.1 \"donation\" \"seans outpost\"`: This command sends 0.1 VRSC to the specified address, with a comment of \"donation\" and a comment-to of \"seans outpost\".\n* `verus sendtoaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 0.1 \"\" \"\" true`: This command sends 0.1 VRSC to the specified address, with the transaction fee deducted from the amount being sent.\n\nBy the way, you can also use the `sendtoaddress` command with the Verus JSON-RPC API, as shown in the example using `curl`.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the `sendtoaddress` command or its optional parameters?",
