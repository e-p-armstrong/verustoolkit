    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand how the `z_shieldcoinbase` API works, but I'm having some trouble. Can you explain it to me, and what are its parameters and results?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_shieldcoinbase` API is a deprecated function that allows you to shield transparent coinbase funds by sending them to a shielded zaddr. This API is not necessary to use on Verus or standard PBaaS networks. \n\nLet me break down how it works and its parameters for you. \n\nThe `z_shieldcoinbase` API takes four parameters:\n\n1. `fromaddress`: This is a required string parameter that specifies the address from which to shield coinbase funds. It can be a taddr (transparent address) or `\"*\"` to shield funds from all taddrs belonging to the wallet.\n2. `toaddress`: This is a required string parameter that specifies the zaddr (shielded address) to which to send the shielded funds.\n3. `fee`: This is an optional numeric parameter that specifies the fee amount to attach to this transaction. The default fee is 0.0001.\n4. `limit`: This is an optional numeric parameter that limits the maximum number of utxos to shield. If set to 0, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option will determine the number of utxos before Overwinter, or as many as will fit in the transaction after Overwinter. The default limit is 50.\n\nWhen you call the `z_shieldcoinbase` API, it returns a JSON object with the following results:\n\n1. `remainingUTXOs`: The number of coinbase utxos still available for shielding.\n2. `remainingValue`: The value of coinbase utxos still available for shielding.\n3. `shieldingUTXOs`: The number of coinbase utxos being shielded.\n4. `shieldingValue`: The value of coinbase utxos being shielded.\n5. `opid`: An operation ID that can be passed to `z_getoperationstatus` to get the result of the operation.\n\nIt's also important to note that the `z_shieldcoinbase` API is an asynchronous operation, which means that it does not block until the operation is complete. Instead, it returns immediately and locks the utxos selected for shielding. If there is an error, the utxos are unlocked. You can use the `listlockunspent` RPC call to return a list of locked utxos.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the `z_shieldcoinbase` API, or would you like me to clarify anything?",

            "z_shieldcoinbase \"fromaddress\" \"tozaddress\" ( fee ) ( limit )THIS API IS DEPRECATED AND NON NECESSARY TO USE ON VERUS OR STANDARD PBAAS NETWORKS\nShield transparent coinbase funds by sending to a shielded zaddr. This is an asynchronous operation and utxos\nselected for shielding will be locked. If there is an error, they are unlocked. The RPC call `listlockunspent`\ncan be used to return a list of locked utxos. The number of coinbase utxos selected for shielding can be limited\nby the caller. If the limit parameter is set to zero, and Overwinter is not yet active, the -mempooltxinputlimit\noption will determine the number of uxtos.
