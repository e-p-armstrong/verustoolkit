    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `signrawtransaction` command in Verus, but I'm not quite sure what it does or what kind of information it returns. Can you explain it to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `signrawtransaction` command in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to sign a raw transaction with a digital signature.\n\nWhen you run the `signrawtransaction` command, it takes a hexadecimal-encoded raw transaction as input and returns a JSON object with the signed transaction, along with information about the signing process.\n\nLet me break down what you can expect from the returned JSON object:\n\n* `hex`: This is the hexadecimal-encoded raw transaction with the digital signature(s) added.\n* `complete`: This is a boolean value indicating whether the transaction has a complete set of signatures.\n* `errors`: This is an array of objects containing script verification errors, if any. Each error object has several properties, including:\n\t+ `txid`: The hash of the referenced, previous transaction.\n\t+ `vout`: The index of the output to be spent and used as input.\n\t+ `scriptSig`: The hexadecimal-encoded signature script.\n\t+ `sequence`: The script sequence number.\n\t+ `error`: The verification or signing error related to the input.\n\nYou can use the `signrawtransaction` command in two ways: either by running it directly in the Verus command-line interface, or by sending a JSON-RPC request to the Verus daemon using `curl`.\n\nIn summary, the `signrawtransaction` command is an essential tool in Verus for creating and signing transactions, and its output provides valuable information about the signing process and any potential errors that may occur.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the `signrawtransaction` command or its usage?",
