    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've been exploring the Verus commands, and I'm not entirely sure about the purpose of the `getdeprecationinfo` command. Could you explain what it does and what kind of information it provides?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getdeprecationinfo` command is a utility in Verus that provides information about the current version of the server and its deprecation status. This command is only applicable on the mainnet.\n\nWhen you run `getdeprecationinfo`, it returns an object containing three key pieces of information:\n\n1. **Version**: This is a numeric value representing the current version of the Verus server.\n2. **Subversion**: This is a string that provides additional information about the server version, including the specific build and any relevant tags or labels.\n3. **Deprecation Height**: This is a numeric value indicating the block height at which the current version of the server will become deprecated and shut down.\n\nIn other words, the `getdeprecationinfo` command helps you stay informed about the current version of the Verus server and when it will become outdated. This information is essential for ensuring that your Verus setup remains up-to-date and compatible with the latest network requirements.\n\nYou can use this command in two ways: either by running `verus getdeprecationinfo` in the command line or by sending a JSON-RPC request using `curl` or a similar tool. The examples provided demonstrate both approaches.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the `getdeprecationinfo` command or its usage?",
