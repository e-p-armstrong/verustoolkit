    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about sending multiple transactions at once. How can I use the `sendmany` command in Verus to send multiple transactions at once, and what are the available options for customizing this command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendmany` command in Verus is a convenient way to send VRSC to multiple addresses in a single operation. The basic syntax of the command is:\n```\nsendmany \"fromaccount\" {\"address\":amount,...} ( minconf \"comment\" [\"address\",...] )\n```\nHere's a breakdown of the available options:\n\n* `\"fromaccount\"`: This must be set to an empty string (`\"\"`), which represents the default account. Any other string will result in an error.\n* `\"amounts\"`: This is a JSON object that specifies the addresses and amounts to be sent. The format is `{ \"address\":amount,... }`, where `address` is the VRSC address and `amount` is the numeric amount in VRSC.\n* `minconf`: This is an optional numeric parameter that specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for the balance to be used. The default value is 1.\n* `\"comment\"`: This is an optional string parameter that allows you to add a comment to the transaction.\n* `subtractfeefromamount`: This is an optional JSON array that specifies the addresses from which the transaction fee will be deducted. If no addresses are specified, the sender pays the fee.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `sendmany` command to send two amounts to two different addresses:\n```\nverus sendmany \"\" \"{\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\":0.01,\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\":0.02}\"\n```\nAnd here's an example of how to use the `sendmany` command with additional options:\n```\nverus sendmany \"\" \"{\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\":0.01,\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\":0.02}\" 6 \"testing\"\n```\nIn this example, the `minconf` parameter is set to 6, and the `comment` parameter is set to `\"testing\"`.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `sendmany` command or customizing it for your needs?",
