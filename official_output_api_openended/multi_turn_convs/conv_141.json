    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with some commands in Verus, and I'm not entirely sure what the `getnetworkhashps` command is for. Can you explain its purpose and how it estimates the network's solution rate?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getnetworkhashps` command in Verus is actually a deprecated command that's been left for backwards-compatibility purposes. It's recommended to use `getnetworksolps` instead. But I can still explain how it works.\n\nThe `getnetworkhashps` command estimates the network's solution rate, specifically the number of solutions per second, based on the last `n` blocks. You can think of it as a way to gauge the overall processing power of the Verus network.\n\nThe command takes two optional arguments: `blocks` and `height`. The `blocks` argument specifies the number of blocks to use for the estimation, with a default value of 120. If you set it to -1, the command will use blocks over the difficulty averaging window. The `height` argument estimates the network speed at the time when a certain block was found, with a default value of -1.\n\nThe result of the command is a numeric value representing the estimated solutions per second.\n\nFor example, you can use the command without any arguments to get the estimated network solution rate based on the last 120 blocks:\n```\nverus getnetworkhashps\n```\nAlternatively, you can specify the number of blocks or the height to estimate the network speed at a specific point in time.\n\nDo you have any more questions about this command, or would you like to know more about the `getnetworksolps` command instead?",
