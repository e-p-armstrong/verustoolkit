    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get the balance of some addresses on the Verus network. Can you tell me about the `getaddressbalance` command in Verus, and how I can use it to retrieve the balance of one or more addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getaddressbalance` command is a powerful tool that allows you to retrieve the balance of one or more addresses on the Verus network. This command requires that the `addressindex` is enabled, which allows Verus to keep track of all addresses and their corresponding balances.\n\nTo use the `getaddressbalance` command, you need to provide a JSON object with two arguments: `addresses` and `friendlynames`. The `addresses` argument is an array of base58check encoded addresses, and the `friendlynames` argument is a boolean that specifies whether to include additional friendly names keyed by currency i-addresses in the result.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `getaddressbalance` command:\n```\nverus getaddressbalance '{\"addresses\": [\"RY5LccmGiX9bUHYGtSWQouNy1yFhc5rM87\"]}'\n```\nThis command will return a JSON object with two properties: `balance` and `received`. The `balance` property represents the current balance of the address in satoshis, and the `received` property represents the total number of satoshis received by the address, including change.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `curl` command to send a JSON-RPC request to the Verus daemon, like this:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getaddressbalance\", \"params\": [{\"addresses\": [\"RY5LccmGiX9bUHYGtSWQouNy1yFhc5rM87\"]}] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nThis will also return the balance and received amounts for the specified address.\n\nOverall, the `getaddressbalance` command is a useful tool for anyone who needs to retrieve the balance of one or more addresses on the Verus network. Do you have any more questions about this command, or would you like some help with using it?",
