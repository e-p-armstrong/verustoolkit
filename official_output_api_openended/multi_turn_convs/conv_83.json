    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to figure out how to use the `getaddednodeinfo` command in Verus. Can you explain what it does and how I can use it to retrieve information about added nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getaddednodeinfo` command in Verus is a powerful tool for retrieving information about the nodes that have been added to the Verus network. \n\nThis command takes two arguments: `dns` and `\"node\"`. The `dns` argument is a required boolean value that determines the type of information returned by the command. If `dns` is set to `false`, the command will only return a list of added nodes. If `dns` is set to `true`, the command will return detailed information about the added nodes, including their connected status and addresses.\n\nThe `\"node\"` argument is an optional string value that specifies a particular node to retrieve information about. If this argument is omitted, the command will return information about all added nodes.\n\nThe result of the `getaddednodeinfo` command is a JSON array of objects, each representing an added node. Each object contains the following information:\n\n* `addednode`: The IP address of the node.\n* `connected`: A boolean value indicating whether the node is connected or not.\n* `addresses`: An array of objects, each representing an address of the node. Each address object contains the following information:\n\t+ `address`: The server host and port of the address.\n\t+ `connected`: A string indicating the type of connection, either \"inbound\" or \"outbound\".\n\nYou can use the `getaddednodeinfo` command in Verus by running `./verus getaddednodeinfo true` to retrieve information about all added nodes, or `./verus getaddednodeinfo true \"192.168.0.201\"` to retrieve information about a specific node with the IP address \"192.168.0.201\". You can also use the command with `curl` to retrieve the information via HTTP.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using `getaddednodeinfo`, or would you like more information about a specific aspect of the command?",
