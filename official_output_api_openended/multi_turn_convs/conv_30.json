    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get a better understanding of the commands available in Verus. Can you explain the purpose of the `z_listaddresses` command and how I can use it to retrieve a list of shielded addresses belonging to my wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_listaddresses` command in Verus is a useful tool for managing your shielded addresses. It's used to retrieve a list of shielded addresses belonging to your wallet. Specifically, it returns a list of Sprout and Sapling shielded addresses that are associated with your wallet.\n\nTo use this command, you can simply run `z_listaddresses` in your Verus console. This will return a list of shielded addresses that are controlled by your wallet.\n\nIf you want to include watch-only addresses in the list, you can add the `includeWatchonly` argument and set it to `true`. Watch-only addresses are addresses that are not controlled by your wallet but are still monitored by it.\n\nThe result of the command will be a JSON array of strings, where each string represents a shielded address belonging to your wallet.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the command:\n```\nverus z_listaddresses\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the Verus RPC interface to call the `z_listaddresses` method using a tool like `curl`. Here's an example:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_listaddresses\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nThis will return the same list of shielded addresses as the previous example.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the `z_listaddresses` command or how to use it?",
