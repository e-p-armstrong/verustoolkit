    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been using Verus for a while now, but I'm still learning the ropes. Can you tell me how I can get detailed information about a specific transaction in my Verus wallet, and what options do I have for customizing the information that is returned?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGetting detailed information about a specific transaction in your Verus wallet is quite straightforward. You can use the `gettransaction` command in Verus to retrieve the information you need.\n\nThe basic syntax for this command is:\n```\ngettransaction \"txid\"\n```\nJust replace `\"txid\"` with the actual transaction ID of the transaction you're interested in. This will return detailed information about the transaction, including its details and balance calculation.\n\nBy default, the `gettransaction` command will only include transactions that are directly associated with your wallet. However, if you want to include transactions that are associated with watch-only addresses in your wallet, you can add an optional second argument, `includeWatchonly`, and set it to `true`.\n\nThe syntax for this would be:\n```\ngettransaction \"txid\" true\n```\nThis will return the same information as before, but it will also include transactions associated with watch-only addresses in your wallet.\n\nThe `gettransaction` command is a powerful tool for managing your transactions and keeping track of your wallet's activity. By using it, you can get a clear picture of your transaction history and make more informed decisions about your wallet's management.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `gettransaction` command, or would you like to know more about customizing the information that is returned?",
