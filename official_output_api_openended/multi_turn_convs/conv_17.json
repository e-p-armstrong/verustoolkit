    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to figure out how to create a multisignature address in my Verus wallet, but I'm not sure how to use the `addmultisigaddress` command. Can you explain what it's for and how to use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `addmultisigaddress` command is a powerful tool in Verus that allows you to create a multisignature address in your wallet. A multisignature address is a special type of address that requires a certain number of signatures (defined by `nrequired`) out of a total number of keys or addresses to authorize a transaction.\n\nTo use the `addmultisigaddress` command, you need to provide three arguments: `nrequired`, `keysobject`, and an optional `account` argument.\n\n* `nrequired` is a numeric value that specifies the minimum number of signatures required to authorize a transaction.\n* `keysobject` is a JSON array of VRSC addresses or hex-encoded public keys. Each key in the array is a VRSC address or a hex-encoded public key.\n* `account` is an optional argument that is deprecated and should be set to an empty string (`\"\"`).\n\nThe command returns a VRSC address associated with the keys.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `addmultisigaddress` command to create a multisignature address from 2 addresses:\n```\nverus addmultisigaddress 2 \"[\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\",\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\"]\"\n```\nThis command creates a multisignature address that requires 2 signatures out of the 2 provided keys to authorize a transaction.\n\nYou can also use the `addmultisigaddress` command as a JSON RPC call, like this:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"addmultisigaddress\", \"params\": [2, \"[\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\",\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\"]\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nThis command sends a JSON RPC request to the Verus server to create a multisignature address with the same parameters as the previous example.\n\nDo you have any questions about using the `addmultisigaddress` command, or would you like to know more about multisignature addresses in general?",
