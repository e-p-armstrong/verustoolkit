    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to manage some temporarily unspendable outputs in Verus, and I've come across the `listlockunspent` command. Can you explain what this command is and how it can be used to manage these outputs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listlockunspent` command is a powerful tool in Verus that helps you manage temporarily unspendable outputs. It's used to retrieve a list of transactions that have been locked to prevent them from being spent. This command is closely related to the `lockunspent` command, which is used to lock and unlock transactions for spending.\n\nWhen you run `listlockunspent`, the command returns a list of objects, each containing two properties: `txid` and `vout`. The `txid` property is the transaction ID of the locked transaction, and the `vout` property is the vout value of the transaction.\n\nLet me walk you through an example of how to use the `listlockunspent` command:\n\n1. First, you can list the unspent transactions using the `listunspent` command.\n2. Then, you can lock an unspent transaction using the `lockunspent` command with the `false` parameter, specifying the transaction ID and vout value.\n3. After locking the transaction, you can use the `listlockunspent` command to list the locked transactions.\n4. Finally, you can unlock the transaction again using the `lockunspent` command with the `true` parameter, specifying the transaction ID and vout value.\n\nYou can also use the `listlockunspent` command as a JSON RPC call, which allows you to interact with the Verus daemon remotely. To do this, you can use the `curl` command to send a JSON RPC request to the Verus daemon, specifying the `listlockunspent` method and an empty parameter array.\n\nOverall, the `listlockunspent` command is a useful tool for managing temporarily unspendable outputs in Verus, and can be used in conjunction with the `lockunspent` command to lock and unlock transactions for spending.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the `listlockunspent` command or managing temporarily unspendable outputs in Verus?",
