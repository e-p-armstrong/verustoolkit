    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to use the `getidentityhistory` command in Verus to retrieve the history of an identity. Can you walk me through how to use it and what options are available for customizing the results?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getidentityhistory` command in Verus is a powerful tool for retrieving the history of an identity on the Verus network. To use it, you'll need to provide a string argument in the format \"name@ || iid\", which is the name or i-address of the identity for which you want to retrieve the history.\n\nNow, let's dive into the optional arguments that allow you to customize the results:\n\n* `heightstart`: This is an optional number argument that specifies the starting block height for which you want to retrieve the identity history. If not specified, the default value is 0, which means the command will return the entire history of the identity.\n* `heightend`: This is an optional number argument that specifies the ending block height for which you want to retrieve the identity history. If not specified, the default value is 0, which means the command will return the history up to the current block height. You can also specify -1 to include values from the mempool.\n* `txproofs`: This is an optional boolean argument that specifies whether you want to include proof of ID in the results. If true, the command will return the proof of ID.\n* `txproofheight`: This is an optional number argument that specifies the height from which to generate the proof of ID.\n\nYou can use the `getidentityhistory` command in two ways:\n\n1. Through the Verus command-line interface: `verus getidentityhistory \"name@\"`\n2. Through the Verus JSON-RPC API: `curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getidentityhistory\", \"params\": [\"name@\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`\n\nBy using the `getidentityhistory` command, you can retrieve the history of an identity on the Verus network, including its transactions, updates, and other relevant information. The command provides a flexible way to customize the results by specifying the starting and ending block heights, and whether to include proof of ID.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `getidentityhistory` command or customizing the results?",
