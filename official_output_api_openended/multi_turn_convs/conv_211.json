    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand the `coinsupply` command in Verus, but I'm not entirely sure what it does or how to use it. Can you explain the purpose of the `coinsupply` command and how it can be used to retrieve coin supply information at a specific block height?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `coinsupply` command in Verus is a really useful tool for getting information about the coin supply of the native coin on the Verus blockchain. Its main purpose is to retrieve coin supply information at a specific block height. This command allows users to query the current coin supply of the native coin, including both transparent and shielded coin supplies.\n\nThe command can be used with an optional argument, `height`, which specifies the block height at which to retrieve the coin supply information. If no height is provided, the command will default to the current block height.\n\nThe result of the `coinsupply` command is a JSON object that contains the following information:\n\n* `result`: a string indicating whether the request was successful\n* `coin`: the currency symbol of the native coin of the blockchain\n* `height`: the block height at which the coin supply information was retrieved\n* `supply`: the transparent coin supply as a float value\n* `zfunds`: the shielded coin supply (in zaddrs) as a float value\n* `total`: the total coin supply, which is the sum of the transparent and shielded coin supplies\n\nYou can use the `coinsupply` command in two ways: either by running the command directly in the Verus CLI using `verus coinsupply <height>`, or by sending a JSON-RPC request to the Verus node using `curl`.\n\nFor example, to retrieve the coin supply information at block height 420 using the Verus CLI, you would run the command `verus coinsupply 420`. To do the same using a JSON-RPC request, you would use the following command:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"coinsupply\", \"params\": [420] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nOverall, the `coinsupply` command provides a useful way to retrieve information about the coin supply of the native coin on the Verus blockchain, and can be used to track changes in the coin supply over time.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the `coinsupply` command, or how to use it in different scenarios?",
