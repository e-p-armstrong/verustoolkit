    "How does the `setidentitytimelock` command work in Verus, and what are the differences between using \"unlockatblock\" and \"setunlockdelay\" to control access to funds for an on-chain VerusID?",
    "The `setidentitytimelock` command is used to enable time-locking and unlocking of funds access for an on-chain VerusID in Verus. This command does not affect the lock status of VerusIDs on other chains, including VerusIDs with the same identity that have been exported to another chain.\n\nThere are two main ways to control access to funds using `setidentitytimelock`: using \"unlockatblock\" and using \"setunlockdelay\".\n\n**Using \"unlockatblock\"**:\n\"unlockatblock\" allows you to set a specific block height at which the identity will be unlocked. This can be used to either unlock the identity immediately by passing the current block height, or to set a future unlock height that will automatically unlock when the specified block passes. This type of time lock is absolute, meaning it will unlock exactly at the specified block height.\n\n**Using \"setunlockdelay\"**:\n\"setunlockdelay\", on the other hand, allows you to set a delay period during which the identity will be unable to spend funds after it has been unlocked. This means that even after the identity has been unlocked, the specified number of blocks must pass before the identity can access its funds again.\n\nIn summary, \"unlockatblock\" sets a specific block height for unlocking, while \"setunlockdelay\" sets a delay period after unlocking. Both options can be used to control access to funds for an on-chain VerusID, and services that support VerusID authentication may also recognize these settings to prevent funds transfers when an ID is locked.",
    "setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\":absoluteblockheight || \"setunlockdelay\":numberofblocksdelayafterunlock}' (returntx) (feeoffer) (sourceoffunds)Enables timelocking and unlocking of funds access for an on-chain VerusID. This does not affect the lock status of VerusIDs on other chains,\nincluding VerusIDs with the same identity as this one, which has been exported to another chain.Use \"setunlockdelay\" to set a time unlock delay on an identity, which means that once the identity has been unlocked,\nnumberofblocksdelayafterunlock must then pass before the identity will be able to spend funds on this blockchain. Services\nwhich support VerusID authentication and recognize this setting may also choose to prevent funds transfers when an ID is locked.Use \"unlockatblock\" to either unlock, by passing the current block, which will still require waiting for the specified unlock\ndelay, or to set a future unlock height that immediately begins counting down. Unlike an unlock delay, which only starts counting\ndown when the ID is unlocked, an \"unlockatblock\" time lock is absolute and will automatically unlock when the specified\nblock passes.",
