    "What is the `getidentitytrust` command in Verus, and how does it work?",
    "The `getidentitytrust` command in Verus is used to retrieve the trust ratings for one or more specified IDs. The command takes an optional argument, which is an array of IDs (`\"[\"id\",...]\"`) for which you want to retrieve the trust ratings. If no IDs are specified, the command returns the trust ratings for all IDs.\n\nThe command returns a JSON object with two properties: `setratings` and `identitytrustmode`. The `setratings` property is an object that maps each ID to its corresponding trust rating, represented as a JSON object. The `identitytrustmode` property is an integer that specifies the trust mode for the identity. There are three possible trust modes:\n\n* `0`: No restriction on sync, meaning that the identity can sync with any other ID.\n* `1`: Only sync to IDs rated as approved, meaning that the identity can only sync with IDs that have been explicitly trusted.\n* `2`: Sync to all IDs but those on the block list, meaning that the identity can sync with all IDs except those that have been explicitly blocked.\n\nYou can use the `getidentitytrust` command in two ways: by running it directly in the Verus console using the `verus` command, or by sending a JSON-RPC request using `curl`. The examples provided in the text show how to use both methods.\n\nFor example, if you want to retrieve the trust ratings for the IDs `id1` and `id2`, you can run the following command in the Verus console:\n```\nverus getidentitytrust '[\"id1\", \"id2\"]'\n```\nAlternatively, you can send a JSON-RPC request using `curl`:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getidentitytrust\", \"params\": ['[\"id1\", \"id2\"]'] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nThis will return a JSON object with the trust ratings for the specified IDs, as well as the current trust mode for the identity.",
