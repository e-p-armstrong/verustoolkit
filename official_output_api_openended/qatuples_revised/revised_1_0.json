    "How do I use the `getreceivedbyaddress` command in Verus to get the total amount of VRSC received by a specific address, and what are the different options I can use to customize the result?",
    "The `getreceivedbyaddress` command in Verus is used to get the total amount of VRSC received by a specific VRSC address. This command takes two arguments: the VRSC address and the minimum number of confirmations.\n\nThe first argument, \"VRSC_address\", is a required string that specifies the VRSC address for which you want to get the total received amount.\n\nThe second argument, `minconf`, is an optional numeric value that specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for a transaction to be included in the total amount. If you don't specify a value for `minconf`, it defaults to 1, which means the command will only include transactions with at least one confirmation.\n\nThe result of the command is the total amount of VRSC received at the specified address, in numeric format.\n\nYou can customize the result by specifying a different value for `minconf`. For example, if you want to include unconfirmed transactions, you can set `minconf` to 0. If you want to only include transactions with a high number of confirmations, you can set `minconf` to a higher value, such as 6.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `getreceivedbyaddress` command:\n\n* To get the total amount from transactions with at least 1 confirmation, you can use the command `verus getreceivedbyaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\"`.\n* To get the total amount including unconfirmed transactions, you can use the command `verus getreceivedbyaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 0`.\n* To get the total amount with at least 6 confirmations, you can use the command `verus getreceivedbyaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 6`.\n\nYou can also use the `getreceivedbyaddress` command as a JSON RPC call, as shown in the example.",
