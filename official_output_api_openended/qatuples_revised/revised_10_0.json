    "What information is returned when you query a transaction on the Verus network, and what do each of the returned fields represent?",
    "When you query a transaction on the Verus network, you receive a JSON object with several fields that provide information about the transaction. Here's a breakdown of each field:\n\n**Transaction Information:**\n\n* `\"amount\"`: The amount of VRSC transferred in the transaction.\n* `\"confirmations\"`: The number of blocks that have confirmed the transaction.\n* `\"blockhash\"`: The hash of the block that contains the transaction.\n* `\"blockindex\"`: The index of the block that contains the transaction.\n* `\"blocktime\"`: The time in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, GMT) when the block was mined.\n* `\"txid\"`: The unique identifier of the transaction.\n* `\"time\"`: The time in seconds since the epoch when the transaction was made.\n* `\"timereceived\"`: The time in seconds since the epoch when the transaction was received by the node.\n\n**Transaction Details:**\n\n* `\"details\"`: An array of objects, each representing a transaction output. Each object contains:\n\t+ `\"account\"`: The account name involved in the transaction (DEPRECATED, can be an empty string for the default account).\n\t+ `\"address\"`: The VRSC address involved in the transaction.\n\t+ `\"category\"`: The category of the transaction, either \"send\" or \"receive\".\n\t+ `\"amount\"`: The amount of VRSC transferred in the transaction output.\n\t+ `\"vout\"`: The vout value of the transaction output.\n\n**Zero-Knowledge JoinSplit Information (vjoinsplit):**\n\n* `\"vjoinsplit\"`: An array of objects, each representing a Zero-Knowledge JoinSplit transaction. Each object contains:\n\t+ `\"anchor\"`: The Merkle root of the note commitment tree.\n\t+ `\"nullifiers\"`: An array of nullifiers of input notes.\n\t+ `\"commitments\"`: An array of note commitments for note outputs.\n\t+ `\"macs\"`: An array of message authentication tags.\n\t+ `\"vpub_old\"`: The amount removed from the transparent value pool.\n\t+ `\"vpub_new\"`: The amount added to the transparent value pool.\n\n**Raw Transaction Data:**\n\n* `\"hex\"`: The raw data for the transaction in hexadecimal format.\n\nThis information provides a comprehensive overview of the transaction, including the amount transferred, the block it was mined in, and the Zero-Knowledge JoinSplit data.",
