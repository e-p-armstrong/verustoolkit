    "How do I use the `getaddressesbyaccount` command in Verus to retrieve a list of addresses associated with a specific account, and what are the parameters and results of this command?",
    "The `getaddressesbyaccount` command in Verus is used to retrieve a list of addresses associated with a specific account. This command is deprecated, but it can still be used to retrieve addresses for a given account.\n\nTo use this command, you need to provide one argument, which is the account name. Note that the account name must be set to an empty string (`\"\"`)) to represent the default account. If you pass any other string, it will result in an error.\n\nThe result of this command is a JSON array of strings, where each string is a VRSC address associated with the given account.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this command:\n\n```\nverus getaddressesbyaccount \"\"\n```\n\nYou can also use the `curl` command to call this method via the JSON-RPC API:\n\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getaddressesbyaccount\", \"params\": [\"\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\nIn this example, the `getaddressesbyaccount` method is called with an empty string as the account name, and the result is a list of addresses associated with the default account.\n\nNote that the `getaddressesbyaccount` command is deprecated, and it's recommended to use alternative methods to retrieve addresses associated with an account.",
