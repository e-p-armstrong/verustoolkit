    "What is the `signrawtransaction` command in Verus, and what kind of information does it return?",
    "The `signrawtransaction` command in Verus is used to sign a raw transaction with a digital signature. This command takes a hexadecimal-encoded raw transaction as input and returns a JSON object with the signed transaction, along with information about the signing process.\n\nThe returned JSON object has several properties:\n\n* `hex`: This is the hexadecimal-encoded raw transaction with the digital signature(s) added.\n* `complete`: This is a boolean value indicating whether the transaction has a complete set of signatures.\n* `errors`: This is an array of objects containing script verification errors, if any. Each error object has the following properties:\n\t+ `txid`: The hash of the referenced, previous transaction.\n\t+ `vout`: The index of the output to be spent and used as input.\n\t+ `scriptSig`: The hexadecimal-encoded signature script.\n\t+ `sequence`: The script sequence number.\n\t+ `error`: The verification or signing error related to the input.\n\nYou can use the `signrawtransaction` command in two ways: either by running it directly in the Verus command-line interface, or by sending a JSON-RPC request to the Verus daemon using `curl`. The examples provided in the text demonstrate both methods.\n\nIn summary, the `signrawtransaction` command is an essential tool in Verus for creating and signing transactions, and its output provides valuable information about the signing process and any potential errors that may occur.",
