            "What is the `z_importkey` command in Verus, and how do I use it to add a zkey to my wallet, including optional parameters for rescan and start height?",
            "The `z_importkey` command in Verus is used to add a zkey, which is a special type of key generated by the `z_exportkey` command, to your wallet. This command allows you to import a zkey and optionally rescan your wallet for transactions.\n\nThe basic syntax of the command is as follows:\n```\nz_importkey \"zkey\" (rescan startHeight)\n```\nHere, `\"zkey\"` is a required string argument that specifies the zkey you want to import. The `rescan` and `startHeight` parameters are optional.\n\nThe `rescan` parameter determines whether the wallet should be rescanned for transactions. It can take one of three values: `\"yes\"`, `\"no\"`, or `\"whenkeyisnew\"`. If `rescan` is set to `\"yes\"`, the wallet will be fully rescanned, which can take some time. If set to `\"no\"`, no rescan will be performed. If set to `\"whenkeyisnew\"` (which is the default), the wallet will only be rescanned if the key is new.\n\nThe `startHeight` parameter specifies the block height from which to start the rescan. This parameter is only relevant if `rescan` is set to `\"yes\"` or `\"whenkeyisnew\"`.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `z_importkey` command:\n```\n# Import a zkey with a full rescan\nverus z_importkey \"mykey\" yes\n\n# Import a zkey with a partial rescan starting from block height 30000\nverus z_importkey \"mykey\" whenkeyisnew 30000\n\n# Import a zkey without rescanning\nverus z_importkey \"mykey\" no\n```\nNote that the `z_importkey` command can take some time to complete if a rescan is performed. Additionally, you can also use this command as a JSON-RPC call, as shown in the example:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_importkey\", \"params\": [\"mykey\", \"no\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```",
            "z_importkey \"zkey\" ( rescan startHeight )\n\nAdds a zkey (as returned by z_exportkey) to your wallet.\n\nArguments:\n1. \"zkey\"       (string, required) The zkey (see z_exportkey)\n2. rescan        (string, optional, default=\"whenkeyisnew\") Rescan the wallet for transactions - can be \"yes\", \"no\" or \"whenkeyisnew\"\n3. startHeight     (numeric, optional, default=0) Block height to start rescan from\n\nNote: This call can take minutes to complete if rescan is true.\n\nExamples:\n\nExport a zkey\n> verus z_exportkey \"myaddress\"\n\nImport the zkey with rescan\n> verus z_importkey \"mykey\"\n\nImport the zkey with partial rescan\n> verus z_importkey \"mykey\" whenkeyisnew 30000\n\nRe-import the zkey with longer partial rescan\n> verus z_importkey \"mykey\" yes 20000\n\nAs a JSON-RPC call\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_importkey\", \"params\": [\"mykey\", \"no\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
