            "What is the purpose of the `z_mergetoaddress` command, and how does it work?",
            "The `z_mergetoaddress` command is a feature in Verus that allows you to merge multiple UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) and notes into a single UTXO or note. This can be useful for consolidating fragmented funds and reducing the number of UTXOs in your wallet.\n\nTo use `z_mergetoaddress`, you need to enable it by restarting the Verus daemon with the `-experimentalfeatures` and `-zmergetoaddress` command-line options, or by adding these two lines to your `verus.conf` file: `experimentalfeatures=1` and `zmergetoaddress=1`.\n\nWhen you run `z_mergetoaddress`, you need to specify the `fromaddress` UTXOs or notes that you want to merge, as well as the `toaddress` where you want to send the merged funds. You can also set optional parameters such as the transaction fee, transparent limit, shielded limit, and memo.\n\nHere's how the command works:\n\n1. The command selects the specified UTXOs and notes for merging, ignoring protected coinbase UTXOs (which can be merged using `z_shieldcoinbase` instead).\n2. The selected UTXOs are locked to prevent them from being spent while the merge operation is in progress.\n3. If there is an error during the merge operation, the locked UTXOs are unlocked to prevent any issues.\n4. You can use the `listlockunspent` RPC call to retrieve a list of locked UTXOs.\n5. The number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging can be limited by the caller, and is constrained by the consensus rule defining a maximum transaction size.\n\nOverall, `z_mergetoaddress` is a powerful tool for managing your UTXOs and notes in Verus, but it requires careful use and configuration to avoid any potential issues.",

After Overwinter has activated -mempooltxinputlimit is ignored and having a transparent\ninput limit of zero will mean limit the number of UTXOs based on the size of the transaction. Any limit is\nconstrained by the consensus rule defining a maximum transaction size of 100000 bytes before Sapling, and 2000000\nbytes once Sapling activates.",
