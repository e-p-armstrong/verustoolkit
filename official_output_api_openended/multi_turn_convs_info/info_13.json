            "How do I encrypt my Verus wallet with a passphrase and manage it afterwards?",
            "To encrypt your Verus wallet with a passphrase, you need to use the `encryptwallet` command. However, before you can do this, you need to enable the feature by restarting Verus with the `-experimentalfeatures` and `-developerencryptwallet` command-line options, or by adding these two lines to your `verus.conf` file:\n```\nexperimentalfeatures=1\ndeveloperencryptwallet=1\n```\nOnce you've enabled the feature, you can encrypt your wallet with a passphrase using the following command:\n```\nverus encryptwallet \"my pass phrase\"\n```\nThis will encrypt your wallet with the specified passphrase. After encrypting your wallet, any commands that interact with private keys, such as sending or signing, will require you to set the passphrase beforehand using the `walletpassphrase` command. For example:\n```\nverus walletpassphrase \"my pass phrase\"\n```\nOnce you've set the passphrase, you can perform actions that require private key access, such as signing a message:\n```\nverus signmessage \"VRSC_address\" \"test message\"\n```\nWhen you're finished, you can lock your wallet again by removing the passphrase using the `walletlock` command:\n```\nverus walletlock\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the JSON RPC call to encrypt your wallet:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"encryptwallet\", \"params\": [\"my pass phrase\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nNote that if your wallet is already encrypted, you can change the passphrase using the `walletpassphrasechange` command.",
            "encryptwallet \"passphrase\"\n\nWARNING: encryptwallet is disabled.\nTo enable it, restart zcashd with the -experimentalfeatures and\n-developerencryptwallet commandline options, or add these two lines\nto the zcash.conf file:\n\nexperimentalfeatures=1\ndeveloperencryptwallet=1\n\nEncrypts the wallet with 'passphrase'. This is for first time encryption.\nAfter this, any calls that interact with private keys such as sending or signing \nwill require the passphrase to be set prior the making these calls.\nUse the walletpassphrase call for this, and then walletlock call.\nIf the wallet is already encrypted, use the walletpassphrasechange call.\nNote that this will shutdown the server.\n\nArguments:\n1. \"passphrase\"  (string) The pass phrase to encrypt the wallet with. It must be at least 1 character, but should be long.\n\nExamples:\n\nEncrypt you wallet\n> verus encryptwallet \"my pass phrase\"\n\nNow set the passphrase to use the wallet, such as for signing or sending VRSC\n> verus walletpassphrase \"my pass phrase\"\n\nNow we can so something like sign\n> verus signmessage \"VRSC_address\" \"test message\"\n\nNow lock the wallet again by removing the passphrase\n> verus walletlock\n\nAs a json rpc call\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"encryptwallet\", \"params\": [\"my pass phrase\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
