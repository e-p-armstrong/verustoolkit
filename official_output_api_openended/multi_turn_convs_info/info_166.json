            "The `getsnapshot` command in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to retrieve a snapshot of addresses and their corresponding amounts at a specific block height. This command requires the `addressindex` to be enabled and returns a JSON object containing the snapshot data.\n\nThe `getsnapshot` command can be used to retrieve a snapshot of the addresses and their amounts at the current block height. You can also specify an optional `top` parameter to limit the number of addresses returned, effectively returning the top N richlist.\n\nThe result of the `getsnapshot` command is a JSON object that contains the following information:\n\n* `addresses`: An array of objects, each containing an address and its corresponding amount.\n* `total`: The total amount in the snapshot.\n* `average`: The average amount in each address.\n* `utxos`: The total number of UTXOs in the snapshot.\n* `total_addresses`: The total number of addresses in the snapshot.\n* `start_height`: The block height at which the snapshot began.\n* `ending_height`: The block height at which the snapshot finished.\n* `start_time`: The Unix epoch time at which the snapshot started.\n* `end_time`: The Unix epoch time at which the snapshot finished.\n\nYou can use the `getsnapshot` command in Verus to gain insights into the distribution of funds on the blockchain, track the movement of funds, and analyze the behavior of addresses. This command is particularly useful for developers, researchers, and analysts who need to work with blockchain data.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `getsnapshot` command:\n\n* `verus getsnapshot`: This command retrieves a snapshot of all addresses and their amounts at the current block height.\n* `verus getsnapshot 1000`: This command retrieves a snapshot of the top 1000 addresses and their amounts at the current block height.\n\nYou can also use the `getsnapshot` command with curl to retrieve the snapshot data from a remote Verus node. For example:\n\n`curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getsnapshot\", \"params\": [1000] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`\n\nThis command retrieves a snapshot of the top 1000 addresses and their amounts at the current block height from a remote Verus node.",
            "getsnapshot\n\nReturns a snapshot of (address,amount) pairs at current height (requires addressindex to be enabled).\n\nArguments:\n \"top\" (number, optional) Only return this many addresses, i.e. top N richlist\n\nResult:\n{\n  \"addresses\": [\n  {\n   \"addr\": \"RMEBhzvATA8mrfVK82E5TgPzzjtaggRGN3\",\n   \"amount\": \"100.0\"\n  },\n  {\n   \"addr\": \"RqEBhzvATAJmrfVL82E57gPzzjtaggR777\",\n   \"amount\": \"23.45\"\n  }\n ],\n \"total\": 123.45      (numeric) Total amount in snapshot\n \"average\": 61.7,     (numeric) Average amount in each address \n \"utxos\": 14,       (number) Total number of UTXOs in snapshot\n \"total_addresses\": 2,   (number) Total number of addresses in snapshot,\n \"start_height\": 91,    (number) Block height snapshot began\n \"ending_height\": 91    (number) Block height snapsho finished,\n \"start_time\": 1531982752, (number) Unix epoch time snapshot started\n \"end_time\": 1531982752  (number) Unix epoch time snapshot finished\n}\n\nExamples:\n> verus getsnapshot \n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getsnapshot\", \"params\": [1000] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
