            "How can I retrieve a list of operation IDs currently known to my wallet using the Verus command line interface, and what are the possible filters and results of this command?",
            "The `z_listoperationids` command is used to retrieve a list of operation IDs currently known to your wallet in Verus. This command can be run using the Verus command line interface.\n\nThe basic syntax of the command is:\n```\nverus z_listoperationids\n```\nThis will return a list of all operation IDs known to your wallet.\n\nYou can also filter the results by the operation's state using the \"status\" argument. For example, to retrieve only operation IDs with a status of \"success\", you can use:\n```\nverus z_listoperationids \"status\" \"success\"\n```\nThe result of the command will be a JSON array of strings, where each string is an operation ID belonging to your wallet.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the Verus JSON RPC interface to run this command. The equivalent command would be:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_listoperationids\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nThis will also return a JSON array of operation IDs known to your wallet.\n\nIn summary, the `z_listoperationids` command is a useful tool for retrieving a list of operation IDs known to your wallet in Verus, and can be filtered by operation status for more specific results.",
