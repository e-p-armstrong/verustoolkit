            "The `getnettotals` command in Verus is a utility that returns information about network traffic, providing insights into the performance and activity of the Verus network. Specifically, it provides three key pieces of information:\n\n1. **Total bytes received**: This metric reports the total number of bytes received by the Verus node, which indicates the amount of data downloaded from the network.\n2. **Total bytes sent**: This metric reports the total number of bytes sent by the Verus node, which indicates the amount of data uploaded to the network.\n3. **Total CPU time**: This metric reports the total CPU time spent processing network-related tasks, providing an indication of the computational resources utilized by the Verus node.\n\nBy executing the `getnettotals` command, users can gain a better understanding of their Verus node's network activity and resource utilization. This information can be useful for monitoring performance, identifying potential issues, and optimizing node configuration for improved efficiency.\n\nThe `getnettotals` command can be invoked using the Verus command-line interface (CLI) or through a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) using tools like `curl`. The command's syntax is straightforward, and it does not require any parameters. The response is a JSON object containing the aforementioned metrics, making it easy to parse and analyze the results.",
