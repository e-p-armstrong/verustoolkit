            "What are the various parameters and options available when sending currency using Verus, and how do they affect the transaction?",
            "When sending currency using Verus, there are several parameters and options that can be specified to customize the transaction. These include:\n\n* **Address and Chain/System**: The address and optionally chain/system after the \"@\" as a system-specific destination. This specifies where the currency will be sent.\n* **Refundto**: An optional parameter that specifies where refunds will go in case of a pre-conversion. If not specified, it defaults to the fromaddress.\n* **Memo**: An optional string message to include if the destination is a zaddr (not supported on testnet).\n* **Data**: An optional object that stores large, optionally signed data in one or more outputs.\n* **Preconvert**: A boolean parameter that specifies whether to convert to currency at market price. This only works if the transaction is mined before the start of the currency. The default value is false.\n* **Burn**: A boolean parameter that specifies whether to destroy the currency and subtract it from the supply. This only works if the currency is a token.\n* **Mintnew**: A boolean parameter that specifies whether to create new currency to send if the transaction is sent from the currency ID of a centralized currency.\n\nIn addition to these parameters, there are also two optional parameters that can be specified at the transaction level:\n\n* **Minconf**: A numeric parameter that specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for the funds to be used. The default value is 1.\n* **Feeamount**: A numeric parameter that specifies a specific fee amount to be used instead of the default miner's fee.\n\nThese parameters and options provide flexibility and control when sending currency using Verus, allowing users to customize their transactions according to their needs.",
