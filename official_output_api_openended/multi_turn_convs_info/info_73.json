            "The `getnetworksolps` command in Verus is used to estimate the network's processing power, measured in solutions per second (solps). This command provides an estimate of the network's ability to process transactions and mine blocks.\n\nThe command takes two optional arguments: `blocks` and `height`. The `blocks` argument specifies the number of blocks to use for the estimate, with a default value of 120. If `-1` is passed, the command will use the blocks over the difficulty averaging window. The `height` argument specifies the block height at which to estimate the network speed.\n\nThe result of the command is a numeric value representing the estimated solutions per second. This value provides an indication of the network's processing power at the time of the specified block height or over the specified number of blocks.\n\nIn essence, `getnetworksolps` helps users manage their expectations about the network's performance and make informed decisions about their transactions and mining activities. It is an important tool for monitoring and understanding the overall health and efficiency of the Verus network.\n\nFor example, you can use the command without any arguments to get the estimated network speed based on the last 120 blocks: `verus getnetworksolps`. Alternatively, you can specify the number of blocks or the block height to get a more tailored estimate.",
