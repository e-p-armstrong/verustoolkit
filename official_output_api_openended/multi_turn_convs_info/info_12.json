            "What is the purpose of the `refundfailedlaunch` command in Verus, and how does it work?",
            "The `refundfailedlaunch` command in Verus is used to refund any funds sent to a chain if they are eligible for refund. This command attempts to refund all transactions for all contributors to the specified chain.\n\nTo use the `refundfailedlaunch` command, you need to provide the `currencyid` argument, which can be either an iaddress or a full chain name. This specifies the chain to refund contributions to.\n\nThe `refundfailedlaunch` command can be used in two ways: by running a command in the Verus executable or by making an API call using curl. Here are examples of both:\n\n* Using the Verus executable: `verus refundfailedlaunch \"currencyid\"`\n* Using curl to make an API call: `curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"refundfailedlaunch\", \"params\": [\"currencyid\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`\n\nThe `refundfailedlaunch` command is useful in cases where a chain launch has failed, and contributors need to get their funds back. By running this command, Verus attempts to refund all eligible transactions, ensuring that contributors can recover their funds.",
