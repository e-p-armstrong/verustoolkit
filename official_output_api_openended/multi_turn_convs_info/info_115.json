            "How do I generate a new shielded address for receiving payments using the Verus command line interface, and what are the different types of shielded addresses that can be generated?",
            "To generate a new shielded address for receiving payments using the Verus command line interface, you can use the `z_getnewaddress` command. This command returns a new shielded address that can be used to receive payments.\n\nBy default, the `z_getnewaddress` command generates a Sapling address, which is a type of shielded address used in Verus. However, you can also specify the type of address you want to generate using the `type` argument. The two types of shielded addresses that can be generated are:\n\n* Sapling address: This is the default type of shielded address generated by the `z_getnewaddress` command. Sapling addresses are a type of shielded address that provides a high level of privacy and security.\n* Sprout address: This type of shielded address can be generated by specifying the `type` argument as \"sprout\". Sprout addresses are an older type of shielded address that provides a lower level of privacy and security compared to Sapling addresses.\n\nTo generate a new shielded address, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus z_getnewaddress\n```\nThis will generate a new Sapling address. To generate a Sprout address, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus z_getnewaddress sprout\n```\nAlternatively, you can also use the Verus JSON-RPC API to generate a new shielded address. For example:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_getnewaddress\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nThis will generate a new Sapling address. You can specify the `type` argument in the JSON-RPC request to generate a Sprout address instead.",
            "z_getnewaddress ( type )\n\nReturns a new shielded address for receiving payments.\n\nWith no arguments, returns a Sapling address.\n\nArguments:\n1. \"type\"     (string, optional, default=\"sapling\") The type of address. One of [\"sprout\", \"sapling\"].\n\nResult:\n\"VRSC_address\"  (string) The new shielded address.\n\nExamples:\n> verus z_getnewaddress \n> verus z_getnewaddress sapling\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_getnewaddress\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
