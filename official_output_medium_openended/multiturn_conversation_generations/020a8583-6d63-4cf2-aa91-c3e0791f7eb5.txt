    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    What are the different ways to manage mining and staking on the Verus network,
    and how can I enable StakeGuard to protect against the Nothing-at-Stake problem?


    **ANSWER:**

    In the Verus network, you have control over mining and staking, and can enable
    additional features to protect your interests.


    **Managing Mining and Staking:**

    You can disable both staking and mining using the command `verus setgenerate false`.
    To check your current staking and mining status, use `verus getmininginfo`. This
    will provide you with information about the current state of the network, including
    the current block size, average block fees, difficulty, staking supply, and more.


    The "stakingsupply" figure is an estimate of the total Verus being staked on the
    network recently. You can calculate your approximate chances of staking any given
    block by dividing your eligible staking balance (funds at least 150 blocks old
    in transparent addresses or IDs) by the staking supply.


    To enable staking after restarting `verusd`, you can add `mint=1` to your `VRSC.conf`
    file or pass the `-mint` flag when launching `verusd`.


    **Enabling StakeGuard:**

    StakeGuard is a system designed to solve the Nothing-at-Stake problem, where malicious
    actors can try to cheat the network by staking their wallet from multiple computers
    at the same time. By configuring StakeGuard, you have a chance of receiving the
    ill-gotten staking rewards from those who are trying to cheat the network.


    To enable StakeGuard on the Verus Desktop GUI, follow these steps:


    1. Go to the main wallet screen for Verus.

    2. Click the green Receive button under Private Balance.

    3. Click the copy icon for an address you''d like your StakeGuard proceeds to
    go to. If you don''t yet have a private address, click the "new private address"
    button.


    By enabling StakeGuard, you can protect yourself against the Nothing-at-Stake
    problem and potentially receive rewards from those who try to cheat the network.'
