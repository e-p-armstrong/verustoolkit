    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    How do liquidity pools, automated market makers, and fractional currencies function
    in the Verus DeFi ecosystem, and what are the key concepts and terminology used
    in this context?


    **ANSWER:**

    In the Verus DeFi ecosystem, liquidity pools, automated market makers, and fractional
    currencies are fundamental components that enable decentralized finance (DeFi)
    capabilities. Understanding these concepts is crucial to grasping how Verus DeFi
    works.


    A **liquidity pool** is a pool of funds that is attached to a specific currency.
    This pool can contain multiple currencies, and the value of the attached currency
    is determined by the assets in the liquidity pool. In Verus, all currencies with
    liquidity pools have adaptive supplies, meaning that the supply of the currency
    can change dynamically based on market conditions.


    An **automated market maker** (AMM) is a system that provides liquidity to a market
    or currency. In Verus DeFi, the AMM is responsible for maintaining the liquidity
    pool and ensuring that it remains balanced. The AMM does not involve human traders;
    instead, it uses algorithms to manage the liquidity pool and facilitate trades.


    A **fractional currency** is a currency that is not fully backed by a underlying
    asset, but rather by a fraction of it. In Verus DeFi, fractional currencies are
    created by combining different currencies in a liquidity pool. The value of the
    fractional currency is determined by the weighted average of the underlying assets
    in the pool.


    To illustrate how this works, let''s consider an example. Suppose we have a new
    currency called NewCurrency, which is 100% backed by a liquidity pool containing
    1000 VRSC and 2 ETH. In this case, the value of NewCurrency is equally divided
    between VRSC and ETH, despite their different values outside the Verus ecosystem.
    This means that VRSC and ETH each represent 50% of the value of NewCurrency.


    In summary, the Verus DeFi ecosystem utilizes liquidity pools, automated market
    makers, and fractional currencies to provide decentralized finance capabilities.
    These components work together to enable the creation of new currencies, facilitate
    trades, and maintain liquidity in the market.'
