    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    What are the general steps involved in defining and launching a currency on a
    blockchain using Verus, and what are some of the options and specifications available
    when launching a currency?


    **ANSWER:**

    Defining and launching a currency on a blockchain using Verus involves several
    steps. First, you need to fund the VerusID with a sufficient amount of VRSCTEST
    to launch the currency. Then, you can define the currency using the `definecurrency`
    command, specifying options such as the name of the currency, the type of currency
    (e.g., simple token, fractional reserve currency, or multi-reserve basket), and
    the proof protocol.


    In the example given, the currency definition is simple, with only two options
    specified: `options`: 32, which indicates that the currency is just a token, and
    `proofprotocol`: 2, which means that the controller of the VerusID where the currency
    is launched from can mint and burn tokens at will.


    After defining the currency, a second signer needs to sign off on the currency
    definition and launch the currency. This involves signing a HEX code using the
    `signrawtransaction` command and then submitting the transaction to the chain
    using the `sendrawtransaction` command. Once this is done, it takes around 15
    blocks for the currency to be officially launched on the network.


    Some of the options and specifications available when launching a currency on
    Verus include:


    * Defining the currency as a simple token, fractional reserve currency, or multi-reserve
    basket

    * Specifying the start and end blocks for the currency

    * Setting minimum and maximum preconversions

    * Defining initial contributions and initial supply

    * Offering pre-launch discounts and carveouts

    * And much more


    It''s worth noting that the costs associated with launching a currency on Verus
    go to the miners and stakers of the blockchain. Additionally, the Verus community
    is available to help with any questions or issues that may arise during the process.'

    **User:**

    I''m interested in creating my own currency on a blockchain using Verus. Can you
    walk me through the general steps involved in defining and launching a currency,
    and what are some of the options and specifications available when launching a
    currency?


    **AI Assistant:**

    Launching a currency on Verus involves a few key steps. I''d be happy to guide
    you through the process.


    To get started, you''ll need to fund your VerusID with a sufficient amount of
    VRSCTEST to launch the currency. Once you''ve done that, you can define the currency
    using the `definecurrency` command. This is where you''ll specify various options
    for your currency, such as its name, type (e.g., simple token, fractional reserve
    currency, or multi-reserve basket), and proof protocol.


    For example, you might define a currency with only two options specified: `options`:
    32, indicating that the currency is just a token, and `proofprotocol`: 2, allowing
    the controller of the VerusID to mint and burn tokens at will.


    After defining the currency, you''ll need a second signer to sign off on the currency
    definition and launch the currency. This involves signing a HEX code using the
    `signrawtransaction` command and then submitting the transaction to the chain
    using the `sendrawtransaction` command. Once this is done, it takes around 15
    blocks for the currency to be officially launched on the network.


    As for the options and specifications available when launching a currency on Verus,
    there are many to consider. Some examples include:


    * Defining the currency as a simple token, fractional reserve currency, or multi-reserve
    basket

    * Specifying the start and end blocks for the currency

    * Setting minimum and maximum preconversions

    * Defining initial contributions and initial supply

    * Offering pre-launch discounts and carveouts

    * And much more


    It''s also worth noting that the costs associated with launching a currency on
    Verus go to the miners and stakers of the blockchain. And, of course, the Verus
    community is always available to help with any questions or issues that may arise
    during the process.


    Do you have any specific questions about launching a currency on Verus, or would
    you like more information on any of these options and specifications?'
