    "What steps should I take to restore my Verus wallets after updating, and how can I clean up my system afterwards?",
    "To restore your Verus wallets after updating, you will need to follow a series of steps to ensure a smooth transition. Here's what you need to do:\n\n**Restoring Wallets:**\n\n1. First, navigate to the BK-komodo folder and copy its contents.\n2. Then, paste these contents into the Komodo folder.\n3. Next, open the VRSC folder within the BK-komodo folder and copy the wallet.dat file.\n4. Finally, paste the wallet.dat file into the VRSC folder within the Komodo folder.\n\n**Cleaning Up:**\n\nAfter verifying that everything is working correctly, your wallets are restored, and balances are showing (if you did an update), you can clean up your system to save space on your drive.\n\n1. You can remove the BK-komodo folder, but make sure to back up all wallet files elsewhere first.\n2. Consider removing old versions of Verus wallet or Agama, and rename the new application folders appropriately.\n3. You can also create links to the new folders for easier access.\n4. Lastly, it's safe to delete the Bootstrap files you downloaded, which can save you a few GB of space. If you need to do any updates in the future, you'll want to download recent bootstraps for that time to make the most use of them, so deleting these files is no problem.\n\nRemember to always back up your wallet files and ensure that everything is working correctly before cleaning up your system.",
