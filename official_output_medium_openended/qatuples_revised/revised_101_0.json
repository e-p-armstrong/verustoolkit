    "How do I set up a Verus daemon, and what are some optional steps I can take to make my life easier, such as setting up scripts and email alerts?",
    "To set up a Verus daemon, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install screen**: Install the `screen` command on your system. This will allow you to run a command in the background and reattach to it later.\n2. **Launch screen**: From your Home folder, launch `screen` with the command `screen`. This will start a new terminal inside your SSH session.\n3. **Launch Verus daemon**: Launch the Verus daemon for the first time with the command `./verus-cli/verusd -mint`.\n4. **Reattach to screen**: You can safely close your SSH terminal window. When you return to check it later, reattach to the screen with the command `screen -r`.\n\nOptional steps to make your life easier:\n\n**Setup scripts and email alerts**: This is an optional but recommended step. You can create scripts to automate tasks, such as shielding and unshielding coins, and set up email alerts to notify you of important events.\n\n**Create a notes document**: Create a text document or spreadsheet to keep notes on different commands you'll need to issue down the road. This can include commands you may not want to script, such as unshielding coins, as well as your t and zs addresses.\n\n**Script shielding and unshielding**: You can script shielding, which involves sending coins from your tAddr to your zsAddr, but unshielding, which involves sending coins from your zsAddr to your tAddr, may require customization and is best done manually.\n\n**Construct your \"From\" email address**: If you want to set up email alerts, you'll need to construct your \"From\" email address in a specific format, which involves your IP address. The format is `youruser@Your.IP.address.reversed.in-addr.arpa`. For example, if your Droplet server IP is 55.44.33.22, the correct \"From\" email would be `youruser@22.33.44.55.in-addr.arpa`.",

If you do, be sure to follow the tasks in \u201cScripts to Create and Tasks to Take AFTER Verus Syncs\u201d.\nStep 4: Setup Scripts and Email Alerts\nThis is, of course, optional but it makes your life easier! The first thing I would do with this is create a text document where you can keep notes on different commands you\u2019ll need to issue down the road, commands you may not want to script.\nFor example, to unshield coins (send from your zsAddr, the new Sapling Z address, to your tAddr) you may want to issue the command each time so you can be custom with your amount as well as wallet addresses. Shielding, however, can be done with a single command for All coinbases that need shielding, so it\u2019s easy to script.\nYou can also store your t and zs addresses in that document, so you can easily copy and paste whenever necessary. I have a spreadsheet with calculations and all sorts of interesting data I like to track, so you may go that route\u2026or just a simple text file will do.\nFor scripts that involve emailing you, you\u2019ll need to construct your \u201cFrom\u201d email address with a specific format which involves your IP. Here\u2019s how it works: youruser@Your.IP.address.reversed.in-addr.arpa\nFor example, let\u2019s say your Droplet server IP is 55.44.33.22. The correct \u201cFrom\u201d email would be: youruser@22.33.44.55.in-addr.arpa\nYou\u2019ll see this in the script, just change the IP numbers to your IP reversed and the username to yours.\nSome of the scripts below are only able to be created after Verus has fully sy",
