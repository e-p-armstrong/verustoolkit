    "What are the capabilities of Verus DeFi, and how does it enhance the functionality of the Verus protocol?",
    "Verus DeFi is a primitive inherent to the Verus protocol that enables the creation of liquidity baskets of up to 10 underlying reserve currencies. This feature allows for the creation of self-balancing, MEV-resistant portfolios that can be used for various purposes, such as permissionless or permissioned ID registrars, where fees are distributed to the liquidity providers (LPs) of the basket.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Verus DeFi is that it enables easy conversions between currencies without worrying about block builder reordering or MEV (Maximum Extractable Value). This is because all conversions of a liquidity basket in any direction that are processed within one or more blocks are always solved simultaneously, with no front or back running. This means that every conversion gets the same price in each direction, with no spread and an ultra-low fee of up to 0.05%.\n\nVerus DeFi is a powerful tool that can be used to build a wide range of applications, from eCommerce enabled supply chains to massively scalable ownership-based games, real-world asset eCommerce enabled networks, voting systems, identity management networks, communication networks, financial networks, and 3D metaverses with identities, brands, and ownership.\n\nIn summary, Verus DeFi enhances the functionality of the Verus protocol by providing a flexible and efficient way to manage liquidity and enable conversions between different currencies, while minimizing the risks associated with MEV and block builder reordering. This makes it an attractive feature for developers and users looking to build and participate in a wide range of decentralized applications.",
    "ly between the Verus and Ethereum networks.\nAll currencies on the Verus network (also the ones bridged over from Ethereum) can be used with Verus DeFi, another primitive inherent to the protocol. Verus DeFi enables liquidity baskets of up to 10 underlying reserve currencies and can serve as a unique, self-balancing, MEV-resistant portfolio, a permissionless or permissioned ID registrar where fees go to the LPs of the basket, or an easy way to send from any reserve currency or the basket currency itself to any other without worrying about block builder reordering or MEV, as all conversions of a liquidity basket in any direction that are processed within one or more blocks are always solved simultaneously, no front and not back. Every conversion gets the same price in each direction with no spread and an ultra low fee (max. 0.05%), again, all part of the L1 consensus.\nWhether you plan to build eCommerce enabled supply chains, massively scalable ownership-based games, real world asset eCommerce enabled networks, voting systems, identity management networks, communication networks, financial networks, 3D metaverses with identities, brands, and ownership or just about any application for a better Web3 on the Internet of Value, you\u2019ll be left behind if you don\u2019t deep dive on Verus first.\nJoin us in the next crypto revolution.
