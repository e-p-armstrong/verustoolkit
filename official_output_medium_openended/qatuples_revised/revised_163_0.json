    "How do I enable staking in Verus, both through the mining dashboard and using the command line interface?",
    "Enabling staking in Verus can be done in two ways: through the mining dashboard and using the command line interface (CLI).\n\n**Enabling Staking through the Mining Dashboard:**\nTo enable staking through the mining dashboard, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the mining dashboard.\n2. Click on Verus on the left side of the interface.\n3. Toggle staking on in the main interface.\n4. You will then see a dashboard showing estimates for potential staking returns based on current network conditions.\n\n**Understanding the Staking Calculator:**\nThe staking calculator provides an estimate of potential staking returns, but it's essential to note that this is only an estimate and may vary based on changing network conditions and the amount of Verus being staked by all participants at any given moment.\n\n**UTXO Details:**\nYou may notice that a portion of your balance is unavailable for staking, having recently staked, and will be available again in 150 blocks. This is a normal part of the staking process.\n\n**Verifying Staking Success:**\nYou'll know you've successfully staked when you see staking transactions and rewards in your transaction list, and when your balance goes up accordingly.\n\n**Enabling Staking using the Command Line Interface (CLI):**\nTo enable staking using the CLI, you can use the following commands:\n\n1. `verus setgenerate true 0` - This command will enable staking and turn your mining threads down to zero if you were mining.\n2. `verus setgenerate true X` - If you want to also re-enable solo mining, you can use this command, where X is the number of threads you want to use.\n\nNote that these commands assume you are already familiar with the command line and have `verusd` running and have met the other prerequisites for being eligible to stake.",
    "Or, from the mining dashboard you can click on Verus on the left side, then toggle staking on in the main interface.That should get you staking. With staking enabled you\u2019ll get a dashboard showing estimates for potential staking returns given the current network conditions that looks like this:The calculator is always only an estimate, since the whole system is based on statistical averages over time, and dependent on changing network conditions. In particular, these estimates and your results will vary based on how much Verus is being staked on the rest of the network by all participants in any given moment.\nNotice in that calculator that it shows only a portion staking \u2014 this is because a portion of the balance is unavailable for staking, having recently staked, and will be available again in 150 blocks. For more information on this aspect see the UTXO Details section below.\nYou\u2019ll know you\u2019ve successfully staked when you see staking transactions and rewards in your transaction list, and when your balance goes up accordingly.\nVerus Command Line (CLI) Staking How-To\nYou might prefer to use Verus on the command line, either to run on much lighter-weight hardware or headless systems, for the ability to script and integrate with Verus, or just for more granular control over your wallet.\nThis assumes you are already familiar with the command line and have verusd running and have met the other prerequisites for being eligible to stake.\nYou can enable staking in a running wallet using this command:\nverus setgenerate true 0\nThis will turn your mining threads down to zero if you were mining. If you want to also re-enable solo mining you can follow this with:\nverus setgenerate true X\nwhere X is the number of threads y",
