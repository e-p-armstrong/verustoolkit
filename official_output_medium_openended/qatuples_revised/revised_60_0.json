    "How does Verus enable the creation, launching, and exporting of IDs and currencies across multiple chains, and what are the benefits of its cross-chain capabilities?",
    "Verus allows for the creation and launching of IDs and currencies on one chain, leveraging the capabilities of that chain, and then exporting them to other chains to be used across the network. This enables IDs and currencies to live across multiple chains, with T-like tokens having a super power over the ID. \n\nFor example, if a currency is launched on Verus or a PBaaS chain, it can be exported to Ethereum, where it will emerge as an automatically created and functional ERC20 contract. This allows the currency to be sent back and forth via protocol between chains. \n\nAll identities and currencies are resolvable worldwide, meaning that a network path can be determined to the nodes of the blockchain where they were defined via their friendly name or i-address, if they have been exported cross-chain. This enables apps to scale over any number of decentralized blockchains worldwide, leaving the management of user databases and user data to the users themselves and the client apps they use.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Verus's cross-chain capabilities is that it provides a high level of flexibility and interoperability between different blockchain ecosystems. This enables the creation of more complex and powerful applications that can operate across multiple chains, without being limited to a single chain or ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, Verus's cross-chain capabilities also enable the creation of more robust and resilient systems, as they can be designed to operate across multiple chains, reducing the risk of a single point of failure. This can be particularly useful for applications that require high levels of security and reliability, such as financial systems or identity management systems.\n\nOverall, Verus's cross-chain capabilities provide a powerful tool for developers and users, enabling the creation of more complex, powerful, and resilient applications that can operate across multiple blockchain ecosystems.",
    "T-like tokens that have a super power over the ID, which is very useful for an ID that may live across multiple chains.\nIDs and currencies may be created and launched on one chain, leveraging all of that chains capabilities (Verus includes many variations in currency, including conditional crowdfunding, liquidity pools, blockchains, etc.), and exported to other chains to be used everywhere across the network. For example, if you launch a currency on Verus or any PBaaS chain, including the native PBaaS chain\u2019s currency. All of those currency definitions can be exported to Ethereum, and they will emerge on Ethereum as an automatically created and functional ERC20 contract, enabling the currency to be sent back and forth via protocol from then on.\nAll identities and currencies are resolvable worldwide, meaning that you can determine a network path to the nodes of the blockchain where they were defined via their friendly name, or usually via their i-address, if they have been exported cross-chain. This enables apps to scale over any number of decentralized blockchains worldwide and leave the management of user databases and user data, as well as settings, signals, endpoints, etc. to the users themselves and the client apps they use to help them manage.\nBecause the currency and liquidity pool support is in the L1 protocol, we have been able to actually solve for and provide MEV-resistant (both intra and inter-block) AMMs as a primitive, available to all applications and users.\nPeople don\u2019t have to write basic liquidity and conversion protocols, which are just primitives, not apps. Real apps can use all of these primitives to deliver the next level of function. Payments, currency conversions, earning systems, polls, voting, multi-chain world scale social networks using provable streams in provable IDs, crowdfunding, independent economies. All primitives, such as IDs, curren",
