    "What are some key benefits and features of Verus reserve tokens and fractional reserve currencies on a PBaaS chain, and how do they differ from traditional cryptocurrency and historical human money?",
    "Verus reserve tokens and fractional reserve currencies on a PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) chain offer several innovative features and benefits that set them apart from traditional cryptocurrency and historical human money.\n\nOne key advantage is that Verus reserve tokens can be converted to the native coin of a PBaaS chain at any time without waiting for notarization and cross-chain transactions. This means that users can easily move their funds between chains and use them in a wallet, just like a native coin. Additionally, fractional reserve currencies can be sent back to the Verus chain and automatically converted to Verus along the way, providing flexibility and convenience.\n\nAnother important benefit is that Verus reserve tokens can be sent on a fractional_reserve blockchain without explicit conversion or Gas, preventing DoS attacks from flooding a chain with transactions. When sending Verus reserve tokens on a PBaaS reserve chain, network fees are automatically paid in Verus, which is converted on the fly to the native currency of the chain. This eliminates the need for additional conversion steps and makes transactions more efficient.\n\nVerus fractional reserve currencies also offer decentralized capabilities and benefits that are new to both crypto and historical human money. For example, the Verus PBaaS protocol enables fully community-funded, fairly-launched reserve currency projects, corporate currencies, and more, which can all share liquidity with the rest of the Verus ecosystem. This means that liquidity is fully shared and grows as the network grows and is used, making the value of a currency less dependent on thin order books and more dependent on its fundamentally recognized value.\n\nOverall, Verus reserve tokens and fractional reserve currencies on a PBaaS chain offer a unique combination of flexibility, convenience, and decentralized capabilities that set them apart from traditional cryptocurrency and historical human money.",
    " historical human money.\nVerus reserve tokens that have already arrived on a PBaaS chain will be convertible at any time to the native coin without waiting for notarization and cross-chain transactions, and also may be used similarly to a native coin in a wallet. Any fractional reserve currency can also be sent back to the Verus chain and auto-converted to Verus along the way. Even when sending Verus reserve tokens on a fractional reserve blockchain with its own native currency, symbol, and project, no explicit conversion or Gas is needed to prevent DoS attacks from flooding a chain with transactions. In fact, when Verus reserve token is sent from one transaction to another on a PBaaS reserve chain, network fees are automatically paid in Verus, which is converted on the fly to the native currency of the chain.\nVerus fractional reserve currencies will have decentralized capabilities and benefits that are fundamentally new both to crypto and also to historical human money. Some are described above and the power of those capabilities will be evident if given some thought, but there are also some very deep concepts that I\u2019d like to at least touch on before getting back to the code.\nThe Verus PBaaS protocol will allow fully community funded fairly-launched reserve currency projects, corporate currencies, and more, that all share liquidity with the rest of the entire Verus ecosystem.\nOne major benefit of the protocol is that across the entire multi-blockchain network of reserve currencies, all liquidity is fully shared and grows as the network grows and is used. The value of a currency going up and down will depend much less on how thin an order book is and much more on its fundamentally recognized value. For example, if a business that accepts Verus, such as La Pasta here in Seattle, decides to make their own reserve currency for food, and offers discounts for purchases wi",
