    "What is the Verus Fee Pool and how does it address the security flaws in traditional blockchain consensus protocols related to fee incentivization?",
    "The Verus Fee Pool is a innovative solution designed to address a fundamental security flaw in traditional blockchain consensus protocols, such as those used in Ethereum and other VM-centric systems. In these systems, miners and stakers have an incentive to reorganize the blockchain and capture blocks with unusually large fees, even after they have been mined by another. This is because the fees earned by miners and stakers are separate from the blockchain consensus protocol.\n\nThe Verus Fee Pool solves this problem by requiring miners to put all fees into a shared pool, and then take a fraction of the pool as their fee reward. This way, it is always more efficient for miners to continue mining forward, as any large sum of fees will be distributed with exponential decay over the current and future blocks.\n\nIn addition to the Verus Fee Pool, fees for conversions can be paid in the source currency and are automatically converted to Verus or the native blockchain currency on a PBaaS chain before being exposed to miners as transaction fees. This provides a complete solution to both the problems of large fee disruptions and integration of DeFi conversions into the consensus security protocol.\n\nIn essence, the Verus Fee Pool ensures that miners are incentivized to act in the best interests of the blockchain, rather than seeking to maximize their own profits at the expense of the network's security. This creates a more secure and stable blockchain economy, and provides a foundation for the development of decentralized applications and services.",

The Verus developers consider this a fundamental security flaw in the consensus protocol and are introducing the Verus Fee Pool, which will be operable on all PBaaS chains as well.\nThe Verus fee pool is a complete solution to enabling a blockchain economy and works by simply requiring that miners put all fees into the fee pool and then take a fraction of the fee pool as their fee reward.
