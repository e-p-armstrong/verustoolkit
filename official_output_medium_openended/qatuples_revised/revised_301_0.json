    "How does Verus's Stake Guard technology work, and how can users benefit from it?",
    "Verus's Stake Guard technology is a Crypto-Condition that helps to prevent cheating on the blockchain by identifying staking wallets that are claiming duplicate blocks on more than one version of the blockchain using the same staked coins. This technology is built into the Verus Wallet and actively hunts for cheaters, allowing users to earn extra Verus coins by catching them.\n\nHere's how it works: when a cheater is identified, the mining or staking wallet that found the cheater can spend any actual single reward the cheating wallet won from the main chain. To use Stake Guard, users need to assign a new Sapling zs-address as their \"cheatcatcher\" address for collecting the coinbases from any found cheated blocks. Only the single coinbase that generated on the main chain (not the forks) of a given cheated stake block height can be claimed by a cheat catcher. This ensures that no new coins are minted and no double spending occurs from any forked chain, either by the cheater or the miner who caught the cheater.\n\nOnce a user has set their Stake Guard zs-address, their full \"Native Mode\" wallet, which is either mining or staking, will automatically hunt down any instances where the same winning coins are being used across different forks and with the same private key. If the wallet finds such a fork, it will hold the cryptographic proof and spend the single real stake reward from the main chain of that block height. This process is automated by the wallet at the time of the cheater's stake reward becoming mature, using the Stake Guard CC's condition to allow a proven cheat spend.\n\nIn summary, Stake Guard is a technology that helps to maintain the integrity of the Verus blockchain by preventing cheating and rewarding users who help to catch cheaters. By using Stake Guard, users can earn extra Verus coins and contribute to the security and stability of the network.",
    "read in the Verus Official Release Notes for v0.4.0, the first Crypto-Condition of Verus called Stake Guard was added in lieu of Sapling activation. As of Verus v0.4.0c the Stake Guard CC has activated and can now earn users extra Verus coins by catching cheaters.\nThe Stake Guard technology built into Verus Wallet actively identifies staking wallets which are claiming duplicate blocks on more than one version of the blockchain, using the same staked coins. Once a cheater is identified, the mining or staking wallet which found the cheater is able to spend any actual single reward the cheating wallet won from the main chain.\nWith the new Verus-enhanced features of Sapling and Stake Guard activated as of block height 227520, any miner or staker can enable Stake Guard (see below for instructions) and their node (native wallet) will begin \u201chunting for\u201d and catching any cheaters found.\nUsers assign a new Sapling zs-address as their \u201ccheatcatcher\u201d address for collecting the coinbases from any found cheated blocks. Only the single coinbase that generated on the main chain (not the forks) of a given cheated stake block height are able to be claimed by a cheat catcher. No new coins are minted and no double spending occurs from any forked chain either by the cheater or the miner who caught the cheater.\nOnce you\u2019ve set your Stake Guard zs-address, your full \u201cNative Mode\u201d wallet which is either mining or staking will also be hunting down any instances where the same winning coins are being used across different forks and with the same private key. If your wallet finds such a fork, your wallet will hold the cryptographic proof and spend the single real stake reward from the main chain of that block height. This is done automagically by your wallet at the time of that cheater\u2019s stake reward becoming mature and by utilizing the Stake Guard CC\u2019s condition, to allow a proven cheat spen",
