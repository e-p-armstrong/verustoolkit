    "How can I set up solo mining and dual mining on Verus, and what are the benefits of doing so?",
    "Setting up solo mining and dual mining on Verus can be a great way to secure the network and earn rewards in the form of Verus coins (VRSC).\n\n**Solo Mining:**\nSolo mining involves setting up a full node of the Verus blockchain on your computer and mining blocks independently. To set up solo mining, you'll need to follow a guide to set up Verus Agama, which will sync up the Verus blockchain and allow you to start mining. Once you've set up solo mining, you'll be eligible to earn the full block reward of 24 coins for each block you mine. Note that solo mining can be less predictable than pool mining, and you may not find a block for a while, but the rewards can be more substantial.\n\n**Dual Mining:**\nDual mining involves using your CPU to mine both solo and on a pool simultaneously. To set up dual mining, you'll need to \"split\" your CPU thread power between the two. For example, if your CPU has 8 threads, you can assign 4 threads to pool mining and 4 threads to solo mining. This allows you to earn a steady stream of VRSC from pool mining while also having the opportunity to earn a larger reward of 24 coins from solo mining. To set up dual mining, follow the guides for setting up solo mining and pool mining, and assign the threads as desired.\n\n**Mining with CPU and GPU:**\nIf you have a modern and capable CPU and GPU (currently, this means an Nvidia GPU), you can mine using both hardware types simultaneously. You can split up your CPU power however you like, assigning it to pool mining, solo mining, or both. You can then use the CCMiner available from the Verus Discord community to loop your GPU into the mining process. This allows you to utilize both your CPU and GPU to mine Verus coins.\n\nIn summary, solo mining and dual mining on Verus can be a great way to secure the network and earn rewards. By setting up solo mining, you can earn the full block reward of 24 coins for each block you mine. Dual mining allows you to earn a steady stream of VRSC from pool mining while also having the opportunity to earn a larger reward from solo mining. Additionally, if you have a capable CPU and GPU, you can use both to mine Verus coins simultaneously.",
    "rus wallet. This is also a really great way to help secure the network, becoming a fully synced node of the blockchain while mining\u2026and for any block found you get the full block reward. You may not find a block for a while, so rewards may be more sporadic, but a full 24 coins when you do win a block.\n\u201cDual Mining\u201d with Your CPU\nIf you use your CPU to \u201cdual mine\u201d pool and solo, simply \u201csplit\u201d your CPU thread power between the two. If your CPU has, say, 8 threads (common for a 4 Core CPU) you can assign 4 threads to Pool mining and 4 threads to Solo mining. While you should have the same earning potential either way (minus very small pool mining fees), this gives you the opportunity to earn a steady stream of VRSC and every once in a while get that \u201cbump\u201d of 24 coins in a single block mined from your solo miner.\nTo set up dual mining in this way, simply follow this guide for setting up the Solo side and then follow my 5 min quick start guide for setting up the Pool side\u2026making sure to assign the threads you want for each (if you split between just assign half to solo and half to pool).\nMining with Your CPU and GPU\nIf you have a modern and capable CPU AND GPU (for now that means Nvidia for GPU), you can mine using both of these hardware types simultaneously. You can split up your CPU power however you like, Pool mining only, Solo mining only, or both.\nYou can then loop your GPU into the party using the CCMiner available from Verus Discord community member Chris of LOUD Mining. The latest build is available at https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer/releases/tag/Verus2\nPart 2 \u2014 Setting Up Solo Mining with Verus Agama\nSolo mining with Verus enhanced Agama is extremely simple to get setup and started. It takes a little bit more time than setting up Pool mining because you\u2019re setting up a full node (Native mode) of Verus and syncing up the Verus blockchain.\nSolo mining is on",
