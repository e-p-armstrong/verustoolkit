    "What are the different states of a Vault in Verus, and how do they affect the ability to spend funds? Additionally, what are the roles of primary addresses, identity addresses, and revocation and recovery authorities in the context of VerusIDs?",
    "In Verus, a Vault is a mechanism that allows users to control their funds in a more secure and flexible way. A Vault can be in one of three states: LOCKED, UNLOCK SOON, or NO LOCK.\n\nA LOCKED Vault means that the funds associated with it cannot be spent. This state provides an additional layer of security, as it prevents unauthorized access to the funds.\n\nAn UNLOCK SOON Vault is similar to a LOCKED Vault, but with a twist. In this state, the Vault is locked, but it will automatically unlock within a time period of 30 days. This allows users to set a temporary lock on their funds, ensuring that they cannot be spent accidentally or maliciously.\n\nA NO LOCK Vault, on the other hand, means that the Vault is not active, and the associated funds can be spent freely.\n\nIn addition to the Vault states, VerusIDs have several key components that play important roles in managing identities and funds.\n\nA primary address is the owner of a VerusID, as it contains the private key. A primary address can contain more than one VerusID, making it a central hub for managing multiple identities.\n\nAn identity address, also known as an i-address, is an identifier of a VerusID, alongside the name. It serves as a unique identifier for each VerusID.\n\nRevocation and recovery authorities are special VerusIDs that have the power to revoke or recover a locked or compromised VerusID. These authorities can be used to regain control of a lost or stolen VerusID, or to transfer ownership to a new entity.\n\nOverall, VerusIDs and Vaults provide a robust and flexible system for managing identities and funds in a secure and decentralized manner. By understanding the different states of a Vault and the roles of primary addresses, identity addresses, and revocation and recovery authorities, users can take full advantage of the benefits offered by Verus.",
