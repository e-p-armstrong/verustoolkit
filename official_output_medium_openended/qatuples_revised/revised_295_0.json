    "How does Verus enable the creation of Community Contributed Value through transparent and auditable processes, and what blockchain primitives does it offer to enhance governance and mitigate risks?",
    "Verus enables the creation of Community Contributed Value by providing a transparent and auditable platform for community currencies. This is achieved through the use of a public blockchain, which allows community members to have instant access to information about currency supplies, reserves, spending, conversion, and more.\n\nOne of the key benefits of using Verus is that it allows for low-risk creation of Community Contributed Value. The cost of setting up a community currency on the Verus network is minimal, amounting to less than $200 in network costs, which are paid to miners and stakers as block rewards. In contrast, the potential reward is significant, with the ability to capture a measurable amount of Community Contributed Value.\n\nVerus also offers several blockchain primitives that enhance the governance and risk management of community currencies. For example, the protocol allows for virtually unlimited flexibility with respect to the governance of who is in control of the initial holdings of CommCurr. This can be achieved through the use of multiple signatures, which can be required to authorize any spending or conversion activity. This allows for sophisticated approval mechanisms and safeguards to be put in place, providing an additional layer of security for community currencies.\n\nAnother important blockchain primitive offered by Verus is the ability to provably and irrevocably lock digital wallets for an arbitrary period of time. This can help to mitigate the moral hazard of dumping holdings and crushing the value of a growing community currency. By locking wallets for a set period of time, community issuers can reduce concerns about the risks associated with community currencies and provide an additional layer of security for community members.\n\nOverall, Verus provides a robust and secure platform for the creation of Community Contributed Value, with a range of features and blockchain primitives that enhance governance, transparency, and risk management.",
    "ake $200,000, which, in this case would be a measurable amount of Community Contributed Value that they captured. There are also some minimal network costs to set this up on the Verus network, which is paid to the miners and stakers, as block rewards, for mining the Verus blockchain, and powering all the community\u2019s transactions. At current rates, it would amount to less than $200. Overall, the cost/risk/reward matrix is attractive.\nIt is important to remember that all of this is transparent and auditable, being on a public blockchain. Community members would be in instant possession of all relevant information about currency supplies, reserves, spending, conversion, etc. by the CommCurr creators.\nCommunity members would have transparency on their spending too, which is unfortunate. However, as a fork of zcash, Verus does offer private transactions on its native currency, Verus, and so there would be methods for users (or preferably, their apps) to help protect the spending privacy of community members.\nGovernance\nThere are other blockchain primitives that Verus enables which enhance CommCurr as an attractive and low-risk method to create Community Contributed Value. First, the protocols allow for virtually unlimited flexibility with respect to the governance of who is in control of the initial holdings of CommCurr. Multiple signatures could be required, up to, for example, 13 of 25, to authorize any spending or conversion activity. This would allow for fairly sophisticated approval mechanisms and safeguards for communities that are implementing this type of experiment.\nMoral Hazard \u2014 Escrow\nAnother blockchain primitive is the ability to provably and irrevocably lock digital wallets for an arbitrary period of time (up to 21 years). In this way, a community issuer could reduce concerns about the moral hazard of dumping their holdings and crushing the value of a growing",
