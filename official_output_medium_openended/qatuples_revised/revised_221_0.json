    "How does Verus protocol support social tokens, and what features make it a more capable and rent-free platform compared to other platforms like Roll or Rally?",
    "Verus protocol provides several features that make it an attractive platform for social tokens. Firstly, it allows for multisignature approvals for the issuance or sale of tokens, which can be tied to entire groups rather than a single influencer. This means that up to 13 of 25 different participants can be involved in the approval process, making it more secure and decentralized.\n\nAnother key feature of Verus is its decentralized bridge to and from the Ethereum network. This bridge enables any token created on the Verus network to be bridged to Ethereum, where it automatically emerges as an ERC-20 token, without requiring any additional programming. This is a crucial element, as Ethereum is a widely-used platform with a large user base. Influencers can create tokens on Verus and bridge them to Ethereum, where they can be used for various purposes such as giveaways, liquidity provision, or other use cases.\n\nMoreover, the bridge also allows tokens to be bridged from Ethereum to Verus, enabling the existence of valuable currencies like USDC, ETH, and WBTC on the Verus mainnet. This feature opens up new possibilities for social tokens, as they can be used across different platforms and networks.\n\nVerus protocol is a more capable and rent-free platform compared to other platforms like Roll or Rally because of its decentralized and open-source nature. It provides a permissionless and inexpensive way for influencers to create and manage social tokens, without relying on centralized authorities or paying fees. Additionally, the Verus community is open to collaborations and is willing to assist anyone who wants to develop on top of the Verus protocol, making it a more community-driven and supportive platform.",
    " Unfortunately, a security incident at Roll led to these \u201cescrowed\u201d amounts being stolen and liquidated.\nSocial tokens might be tied to entire groups, rather than a single influencer. In this case, Verus protocols allow multisignature approvals for the issuance or sale of the tokens. Multisigs can be up to 13 of 25 different participants.\nFinally, Verus testnet currently includes a provable decentralized bridge to and from the ethereum network. This bridge allows any token created on the Verus network to be bridged to ethereum, where it *automatically* emerges as an ERC-20 token, without any additional programming required. This is a crucial element, as ethereum is currently where the users are. Once created on Verus, an influencer can bridge tokens over to ethereum, where it can be used for giveaways, liquidity provision, or any other purpose for which social tokens are used today by Roll or Rally. Similarly, tokens can be bridged from ethereum, meaning that USDC, ETH, WBTC and other valuable currencies will exist on the Verus mainnet.\nStatus\nThese protocols exist now on the Verus testnet and are scheduled for imminent release to the Verus main network. As a community project, and FOSS project focused on core protocol development as a public good, Verus community members have not yet advanced consumer-ready tooling and apps that can take full advantage of these core capabilities. Nevertheless, forward-thinking influencers can start now, since experimentation is inexpensive, permissionless and easy, and some of the tooling and apps do exist for capable users. More importantly though, there is a business opportunity here for companies or entrepreneurs to leapfrog Roll and Rally, or for those companies themselves to pivot to, or supplement their current offerings with, a more capable rent-free platform. The Verus community stands by to assist anyone who would develop to",
