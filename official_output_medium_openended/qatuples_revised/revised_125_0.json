    "How do I setup a secure and robust Verus node, including configuring SSH, setting up a larger swap, and tuning swap settings for optimal performance?",
    "To setup a secure and robust Verus node, there are several steps you need to take. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you configure SSH, set up a larger swap, and tune swap settings for optimal performance.\n\n**Configuring SSH:**\nFirst, you need to configure SSH to improve security. You can do this by editing the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file. Specifically, you need to find the line \"PermitRootLogin\" and change the \"yes\" to a \"no\". This will prevent root login via SSH, which is a security risk. Save the changes with CTRL+O and exit nano with CTRL+X. Then, restart your server with `sudo reboot`.\n\n**Setting up a Larger Swap:**\nThe latest Verus Sapling upgrade has made shielding faster and less resource-intensive, but it's still a good idea to set up a larger swap to make your system more robust, especially if it only has 1GB RAM. You can set up a 4GB swap by following these steps:\n\n1. Create the swap file with `sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile`.\n2. Set permissions to root only with `sudo chmod 600 /swapfile`.\n3. Mark the file as swap with `sudo mkswap /swapfile`.\n4. Enable the file with `sudo swapon /swapfile`.\n\nTo make the swap permanent, you need to edit the `/etc/fstab` file. First, back up the file with `sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bk`. Then, add the swap info to `/etc/fstab` with `echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab`.\n\n**Tuning Swap Settings:**\nFinally, you need to tune the swap settings for optimal performance. You can do this by editing the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file. Specifically, you need to set the Swappiness and Cache Pressure settings.\n\n1. Set the Swappiness setting with `sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf` and add `vm.swappiness=40` to the end of the file. This setting determines how aggressively the system will use swap space.\n2. Set the Cache Pressure setting with `sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf` and add `vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50` to the end of the file. This setting determines how much pressure the system will put on the cache to free up memory.\n\nBy following these steps, you can setup a secure and robust Verus node with a larger swap and optimized swap settings.",

We\u2019ll set a 4GB Swap.\nHere\u2019s how to do that, very simple and no reboot required.\nFirst we\u2019ll create the Swap file with: sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile\nNow that it\u2019s created, we need to enable it by doing a couple things:\n- First set permissions to root only: sudo chmod 600 /swapfile \n- Next, mark the file as swap with: sudo mkswap /swapfile \n- Last, we\u2019ll enable the file with: sudo swapon /swapfile\nThe Swap is on and we need to make it permanent, so it\u2019s used after any reboot or new session. To do this, we need to edit the /etc/fstab file, which can be dangerous so first we\u2019ll back it up. Do the following:\n- Backup the /etc/fstab file with: sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bk \n- Now we\u2019ll add the swap info to /etc/fstab with the following: \necho '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\nNow, we need to edit a couple Swap settings for best performance. You can change these and test different settings, here are my settings that seem to work pretty well.\n- First is Swappiness, a Desktop usually uses a higher setting and a Server a lower, mine is set to 40. This is set by editing the /etc/sysctl.conf file: sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf \nAt the end of the file, add the following: vm.swappiness=40 \n- Next is Cache Pressure, a Server can do with a lower number, for example 50. This is also added to the /etc/sysctl.conf file at the end, first edit the file with sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf and add the following to th",
