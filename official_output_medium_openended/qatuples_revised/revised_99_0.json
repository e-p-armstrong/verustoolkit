    "What are the benefits of holding Pure, and how does it relate to conversions between VRSC and tBTC?",
    "Holding Pure, an Automated Market Maker (AMM) currency, offers several benefits. One of the main advantages is that Pure accrues conversion fees. When users convert between Pure, VRSC, and tBTC, they pay a small conversion fee, which is then divided in half. One half of the conversion fee stays in the Pure reserves, increasing the value of Pure because no new Pure is minted. This mechanism ensures that the value of Pure is constantly appreciating.\n\nThe conversions themselves are MEV-resistant and verified by the miners and stakers of the protocol, adding an extra layer of security and trust to the system. Additionally, users can create subIDs, which cost a small amount of tBTC.vETH in Pure. These costs are burned, reducing the overall circulation of Pure, which in turn increases its value.\n\nIt's also important to note that conversions between VRSC and tBTC are only possible after a preconversion period has ended. During this period, users can fund the reserves of Pure with VRSC and tBTC, and in return, they receive a fair share of the initial supply of Pure.\n\nThe initial supply of Pure was fixed at 20,000, but after the initial distribution, the supply became dynamic. When users convert from VRSC or tBTC into Pure, new Pure is minted, and when they convert from Pure back to VRSC or tBTC, the Pure is burned. This dynamic supply mechanism ensures that the value of Pure is constantly being adjusted based on market demand.\n\nOverall, holding Pure provides a unique opportunity to benefit from conversion fees and appreciate in value over time, making it an attractive option for users within the Verus ecosystem.",
    "Pure is an AMM\nAnother benefit of holding Pure is that the currency accrues conversion fees. When users convert from Pure to VRSC or tBTC (or vice versa) they pay a conversion fee of 0.025%. When users convert between VRSC and tBTC they pay a conversion fee of 0.05%.\nHalf of those conversion fees (50%) stay in the Pure reserves, increasing the value of Pure since no new Pure is minted. The conversions are MEV-resistant and verified by the miners and stakers of the protocol.

These costs are burned reducing Pure in circulation. Learn more about VerusID and what you can do with it here. If users create an identity with your subID as referral, they pay 2/3 less \u2014 you get 1/3 and 1/3 is discounted.\nPreconversion period before the launch of Pure\nBefore Pure was fully launched, there was an 8-day preconversion period. In that period users could fund the reserves of Pure with VRSC and tBTC. During this period no conversions could be done. Depending on how much they added they got their fair share of 20,000 Pure after the 8 day period.\nThe initial supply of Pure was 20,000. After the initial supply has been distributed by the protocol, the supply became dynamic. When users convert from VRSC or tBTC into Pure, Pure is minted. When people convert from Pure back to VRSC or tBTC, the Pure is burned.\nLearn below how Pure was launched without any coding needed. Just a simple API call:What is tBTC, how do I get it & bridge it to Verus?\ntBTC is BTC on the Ethereum network. The decentralized bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum is supplied by the Threshold Network.\nExisting solutions that bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum require users to send their Bitcoin to an intermediary, in ",
