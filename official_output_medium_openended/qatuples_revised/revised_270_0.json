    "What makes Verus Coin special, and what are some of its key features that contribute to its decentralization and security?",
    "Verus Coin is a unique and decentralized project that aims to solve significant problems such as fake news, trust in election results and voting, and restoring privacy when voting. Here are some key features that make Verus Coin special:\n\n**Decentralization:** Verus Coin is designed to be highly decentralized, which means that there is no central authority controlling the network. This is achieved through a combination of Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms, with 50% of the network secured by each. This hybrid approach ensures that the network is both secure and decentralized.\n\n**Fair Launch:** Verus Coin had a fair launch, meaning that there was no pre-mine or ICO (Initial Coin Offering). This means that everyone had an equal opportunity to mine and participate in the network from the start.\n\n**CPU Hash and ASIC Resistant:** Verus Coin is designed to be resistant to Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) mining, which means that it is more accessible to individuals who want to mine using their CPUs. This approach promotes decentralization by reducing the mining barrier and allowing more people to participate.\n\n**Delayed Proof of Work:** Verus Coin benefits from delayed proof of work, which creates a restore point on Bitcoin's blockchain in case of an attack. This adds an extra layer of security to the network.\n\n**PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service):** Verus Coin is the first public blockchains as a service project, which means that it provides a platform for building voting and election systems that support the vision of enabling a better society through blockchain.\n\n**Community-Driven:** Verus Coin is a community-driven project, with over 4 million coins raised through community contributions to sustain the long-term vision. This means that the project is driven by the community's needs and goals, rather than by a central authority.\n\n**Credible Team:** The project is led by a credible team, including Mike Toutonghi, who has a strong background in blockchain development.\n\nOverall, Verus Coin's unique combination of decentralization, fair launch, CPU hash and ASIC resistance, delayed proof of work, PBaaS, community-driven approach, and credible team make it a special project with a strong focus on security, decentralization, and community involvement.",
    "Title: #2 Ben\u2019s Pocket Guide to Verus Coin for Dummies And Smart People Too.\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/a-pocket-guide-to-verus-coin-f0c86e976c33\nContent:Verus virtus potest esse emit / True virtue cannot be bought \u2014 anonymous#2 Ben\u2019s Pocket Guide to Verus Coin for Dummies And Smart People Too.\nA brief overview of this extremely decentralized and fairly launched project that takes aim at solving big problems with fake news, trust in election results and voting as well as restoring your privacy when you vote. This post will give you all the reasons you want to mine, stake and be involved with Verus Coin.\nWith Verus, we plan to create a platform upon which we will build voting and even election systems that support our vision of enabling a better society through blockchain. To run simultaneous polls across disparate populations on one blockchain-based system, we need another dimension of information \u2014 one that retains privacy, and is anchored to a primary store of value, Verus.\nFirst Public Blockchains as a Service project (PBaaS).\nFirst fairly mined coin to create a foundation, over 4MM raised through community contributions of mined coins to sustain the long-term vision.\nA fair launch with nothing held back and no pre-mine which means mining started for everyone at the same time.\nThe World\u2019s fastest CPU hash and ASIC resistant right down to it\u2019s DNA, which means maximum decentralization because of the low mining barrier.\n50% Proof of Work and 50% Proof of Stake which means you can put your coins to work mining(make sure to shield and unshield the coins you mine)\nSecured by delayed proof of work. A Friendly fork of Komodo, which means it benefits from delayed proof of work (creates a restore point on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain in case of attack).\nDid not do a ICO or try to raise funds. Solely focused on building working tech.\nCredible. Mike Toutonghi is Lead D",
