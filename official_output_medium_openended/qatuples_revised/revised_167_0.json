    "What are the different ways to manage mining and staking on the Verus network, and how can I enable StakeGuard to protect against the Nothing-at-Stake problem?",
    "In the Verus network, you have control over mining and staking, and can enable additional features to protect your interests.\n\n**Managing Mining and Staking:**\nYou can disable both staking and mining using the command `verus setgenerate false`. To check your current staking and mining status, use `verus getmininginfo`. This will provide you with information about the current state of the network, including the current block size, average block fees, difficulty, staking supply, and more.\n\nThe \"stakingsupply\" figure is an estimate of the total Verus being staked on the network recently. You can calculate your approximate chances of staking any given block by dividing your eligible staking balance (funds at least 150 blocks old in transparent addresses or IDs) by the staking supply.\n\nTo enable staking after restarting `verusd`, you can add `mint=1` to your `VRSC.conf` file or pass the `-mint` flag when launching `verusd`.\n\n**Enabling StakeGuard:**\nStakeGuard is a system designed to solve the Nothing-at-Stake problem, where malicious actors can try to cheat the network by staking their wallet from multiple computers at the same time. By configuring StakeGuard, you have a chance of receiving the ill-gotten staking rewards from those who are trying to cheat the network.\n\nTo enable StakeGuard on the Verus Desktop GUI, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the main wallet screen for Verus.\n2. Click the green Receive button under Private Balance.\n3. Click the copy icon for an address you'd like your StakeGuard proceeds to go to. If you don't yet have a private address, click the \"new private address\" button.\n\nBy enabling StakeGuard, you can protect yourself against the Nothing-at-Stake problem and potentially receive rewards from those who try to cheat the network.",
