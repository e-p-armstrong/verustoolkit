    "What are the steps to set up a Verus miner using a Ubuntu 20.04 environment, and how can I configure it to start mining?",
    "To set up a Verus miner using a Ubuntu 20.04 environment, you can follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Install proot-distro**\nFirst, you need to install `proot-distro` by running the command `pkg install proot-distro`. This will allow you to create a Ubuntu 20.04 environment.\n\n**Step 2: Install Ubuntu 20.04**\nNext, you need to install Ubuntu 20.04 using `proot-distro` by running the command `proot-distro install ubuntu-20.04`.\n\n**Step 3: Login to Ubuntu 20.04**\nAfter installation, you can login to Ubuntu 20.04 by running the command `proot-distro login ubuntu-20.04`.\n\n**Step 4: Update system packages**\nOnce you are logged in, you need to update the system packages by running the command `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y`.\n\n**Step 5: Install additional packages and dependencies**\nNext, you need to install additional packages and dependencies required for the miner by running the command `apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libjansson-dev automake autotools-dev build-essential git nano`.\n\n**Step 6: Clone ccminer repository**\nYou need to clone the ccminer repository by running the command `git clone --single-branch -b ARM https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer.git`.\n\n**Step 7: Make scripts executable**\nThen, you need to make the `build.sh`, `configure.sh`, and `autogen.sh` files executable by running the command `chmod +x build.sh && chmod +x configure.sh && chmod +x autogen.sh`.\n\n**Step 8: Build the miner**\nNext, you can build the miner by running the command `./build.sh`.\n\n**Step 9: Configure the miner**\nAfter the build is complete, you need to configure the miner by editing the `run` file located in the `ccminer` folder. You can do this by running the command `nano run`. Here, you need to update the `Pool_url`, `Mining address`, and `Cpu threads Number` to match your mining setup.\n\n**Step 10: Start mining**\nFinally, you can start mining by running the command `./ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://Pool_URL:PORT -u MINING_Address.WORKER_NAME -p x -t THREADS NUMBERS`.\n\n**Important Note:**\nWhen configuring the miner, it's advised to not use all of the CPU threads as mining is an intensive job for the CPU and can cause heat that could damage your device. You can find the number of threads your CPU has on the `CPU(s):` line from `lscpu`. Choose a lower number of threads and monitor your device's temperature.",
    "by executing.\n`pkg install proot-distro`\nNote: For now it supports these distributions:(Alpine Linux , Arch Linux ,Kali Nethunter , Ubuntu 20.04 ) for this example we are using ubuntu-20.04\nInstall Ubunt By : \u201c proot-distro install ubuntu-20.04 \u201d\nTo login : \u201c proot-distro login ubuntu-20.04`\nUbuntu logIn\nThe picture show that we are logged in ubuntu-20.04\nUpdate system packages: \u201c apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y \u201d\n>all the following instructions can be found on the miner repository.\nInstall additional package and dependencies: \u201c apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libjansson-dev automake autotools-dev build-essential git nano \u201d\nClone ccminer miner repository: \u201c git clone --single-branch -b ARM https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer.git\u201d\nsingle-branch take two dash as in the picture in cas you see or copy past it Wrong. thanks keda666 from verus discord\nThen cd to \u201c ccminer/ \u201d folder and make \u2018build.sh\u2019 , \u2018configure.sh\u2019 and \u2018autogen.sh\u2019 files executable using this command in one line: \u201c chmod +x build.sh && chmod +x configure.sh && chmod +x autogen.sh \u201c\nWe can then execute \u201c ./build.sh \u201d script on the same place and wait for it to compile the miner\nIf it completes successfully edit the \u201c run\u201d file located in ccminer Folder\n\u201c nano run\u201d (HIT Enter)\nChange Pool_url , Mining address and Cpu threads Number ,to save CTRL+x , respond by Y and hit Enter\n./ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://Pool_URL:PORT -u MINING_Address.WORKER_NAME -p x -t THREADS NUMBERS\nIt should look like this :\nedit the \u201c run \u201c file under ccminer folder to feet your needs :D\n< Prevention is better than the cure>\nIts advised to not use all of the cpu threads because mining is an intensive job for the cpu and will cause heat that could damage your device.
