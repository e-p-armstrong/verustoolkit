    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about bridging ERC-20 tokens to the Verus blockchain. How can I bridge ERC-20 tokens such as USDC, EURC, or DAI to the Verus blockchain using Verus Mobile and MetaMask, and then convert them to other currencies like VRSC?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to walk you through the process.\n\nTo bridge ERC-20 tokens to the Verus blockchain, you will need to use either Verus Mobile or MetaMask. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n**Method 1: Using Verus Mobile**\n\n1. First, you need to add the currencies on the Verus blockchain to your Verus Mobile wallet. To do this, press the plus button in the bottom-right corner and select \"Add PBaaS currency\". Enter the currency code (e.g. eurc.veth, vusdc.veth, or dai.veth) and press \"Continue\" and then \"ADD\".\n2. Next, select the ERC-20 token you want to bridge (e.g. EURC). Press \"Send\" and then \"Convert or cross-chain\".\n3. Select \"Send off-chain\" and enter the recipient address (a Verus address you own, such as an R- or i-address, or a VerusID).\n4. Enter the amount you want to bridge over and select \"Verus\" as the network to send to.\n5. Choose the currency you want to receive as (e.g. EURC.vETH).\n6. Wait for up to 90 minutes for the ERC-20 token to arrive as a currency on Verus.\n\n**Method 2: Using MetaMask**\n\n1. Connect MetaMask to the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website: https://eth.verusbridge.io/.\n2. Enter the address where you want the bridged token to end up on the Verus blockchain (as DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH, or EURC.vETH).\n3. Select the token you want to bridge (e.g. Euro Coin as EURC.vETH).\n4. Choose the destination network as Verus.\n5. Enter the amount you want to bridge over.\n6. Wait for up to 90 minutes for the funds to arrive on Verus.\n\n**Converting between currencies**\n\nOnce you have bridged your ERC-20 tokens to Verus, you can convert them to other currencies like VRSC using Verus Desktop or Verus Mobile. Verus DeFi is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) that allows you to convert between VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH, and EURC.vETH.\n\nTo convert between currencies, simply use Verus Desktop or Verus Mobile and select the currencies you want to convert from and to. The conversion will be done automatically using the AMM.\n\nDo you have any further questions about bridging ERC-20 tokens or converting between currencies on Verus?",
