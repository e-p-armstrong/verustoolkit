    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to figure out how to bridge assets from other blockchains to the Verus blockchain, and then make them visible in Verus Desktop and Verus Mobile. Can you walk me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBridging assets from other blockchains to Verus can be a bit involved, but I'm happy to guide you through it.\n\nTo bridge assets from other blockchains to the Verus blockchain, you need to follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Choose the Asset to Bridge**\nFirst, select the asset you want to bridge from another blockchain, such as ETH, DAI, or MKR. Then, choose the destination, which is the Verus blockchain.\n\n**Step 2: Choose the Amount and Send**\nNext, choose the amount of the asset you want to bridge and click send. Metamask or WalletConnect will guide you through the next steps.\n\n**Important Notes**\nKeep in mind that it may take up to 45 minutes for the bridged assets to arrive on the Verus blockchain and in your wallet. Also, the gas fee calculation might be high, so you might end up paying less, but this is not guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's move on to making those bridged assets visible in Verus Desktop and Verus Mobile.\n\n**Making Bridged Assets Visible in Verus Desktop**\nTo make the bridged assets visible in Verus Desktop, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the \"Multiverse\" tab and click on Verus on the left.\n2. Click on one of the bridged currencies, such as vETH, DAI.vETH, or MKR.vETH.\n3. Click the \"Add Currency\" button.\n4. Repeat this process for all the bridged currencies you want to add.\n5. Go back to the \"Wallet\" tab, and you should see the added currencies in the dropdown.\n\n**Making Bridged Assets Visible in Verus Mobile**\nTo make the bridged assets visible in Verus Mobile, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open Verus Mobile and click on the big plus button in the right bottom corner.\n2. Click \"Add PBaaS Currency\".\n3. Type in the name of the bridged currency, such as vETH, DAI.vETH, or MKR.vETH.\n4. Follow the steps, and the currency will be added to your main screen.\n\n**Preconverting to Bridge.vETH**\nIf you want to preconvert currencies to Bridge.vETH, follow these steps in Verus Desktop:\n\n1. Click on \"Convert Currencies\".\n2. Go to \"Advanced\".\n3. Follow the instructions to preconvert your currencies to Bridge.vETH.\n\nDo you have any questions about the bridging process or making the bridged assets visible in Verus Desktop and Verus Mobile?",
