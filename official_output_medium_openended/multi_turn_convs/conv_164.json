    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the different types of currencies that can be created on the Verus platform. Can you explain the different types of currencies that can be created, and what are their characteristics? Additionally, what are SubIDs and how can they be used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to explain the different types of currencies and SubIDs on the Verus platform.\n\nOn the Verus platform, there are two primary types of currencies that can be created: simple token currencies and basket currencies.\n\n**Simple Token Currencies:**\nA simple token currency is a type of currency that has a fixed total supply, whether it's decentralized or centralized. In a decentralized version, the total supply is fixed and cannot be changed. In a centralized version, the owner of the rootID has control over the supply and can mint new tokens into existence, while anyone can burn existing tokens. This type of currency can also be used to create currencies that are mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s, allowing for seamless transfer between Verus and Ethereum using the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge.\n\n**Basket Currencies:**\nA basket currency is a more complex type of currency that consists of a combination of other currencies or assets. It allows for the creation of a single currency that represents a basket of underlying assets, providing a more stable and diversified store of value.\n\nNow, let's talk about SubIDs.\n\n**SubIDs:**\nSubIDs (short for Sub-IDs) are powerful objects on the blockchain that can be registered under any created currency (both basket and simple token currencies). They can be thought of as a unique identifier that can be bound to various things, such as people, products, content, data, and provable information. SubIDs have read, write, and delete functions, allowing for the storage and management of a wide range of information on the blockchain. They can also be used as a friendly name blockchain address, enabling the receipt, sending, holding, and staking of funds, as well as password-free login to services.\n\nSubIDs are highly versatile and can be used in a variety of applications, such as binding provable contracts and rights to ownership, or storing public and private information. They offer a high degree of flexibility and customization, making them a powerful tool in the Verus ecosystem.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these currency types or SubIDs?",

            "mple of a centralized currency here.\nThe supply of this type of currency is static when it\u2019s a decentralized version. When it\u2019s a centralized version, the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn them.\nThis option is also used to create currencies that are mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s. Which means you can send those ERC-20s over to Verus, or from Verus to the ERC-20. This is made possible with the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge. You can read more about it here.\nAnd of course, a simple token currency can be one of the reserves in a basket currency.\nWhat are SubIDs\nSubIDs are powerful objects on the blockchain. They can be registered in an unlimited amount under any created currency (basket and simple token currency). A few examples are product.MyBrand@ or user.MyBrand@. The name MyBrand@ is a VerusID (a namespace) that is converted into a currency. The subIDs are \u2018product\u2019 and \u2018user\u2019.\nSubIDs can be bound digitally to many things. They can be bound to people and products. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private. Including provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the subID itself.\nAnother powerful feature is that it has read, write and delete functions in what is called the \u201ccontent multimap\u201d. All kinds of information can be read and processed in the mempool of the blockchain.\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there, it\u2019s also a friendly name blockchain address that can receive, send, hold and stake funds, and can be used to login to services, password-free. Read more about VerusID here.\nParameters to Launch Currencies\nThis is all anyone needs to do to launch powerful currencies. Zero coding!\nNext up are the parameters. Choose the parameters wisely to launch a currency that suits any need. Not all parameters are needed or combinable. There are many to go through, s",
