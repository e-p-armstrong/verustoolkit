    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about the Verus protocol and getting involved with testing and exploring its features. Can you tell me about the current state of the protocol and how I can get started?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus protocol is a decentralized multi-chain, multi-currency network that allows anyone to launch blockchains and currencies without requiring programming knowledge. One of the key features of the Verus protocol is its ability to support DeFi (Decentralized Finance) at the protocol layer, which enables a wide range of financial applications and services to be built on top of the network. Additionally, the Verus protocol includes a non-custodial Eth-bridge, which allows for seamless interactions between different blockchain networks.\n\nThe Verus protocol is currently available on the testnet, which means that anyone can download and try out the latest release on GitHub. The testnet is a fully functional environment that allows users to experiment with the protocol's features and get a sense of what the future of decentralized multi-chain, multi-currency networks looks like.\n\nThe protocol developers are hard at work refining the protocol and adding new features, including an additional security mechanism for chain notarizations. This added layer of security will make the protocol even more robust and reliable.\n\nIf you're interested in getting involved with testing and exploring the Verus protocol, I recommend starting by downloading the latest release on GitHub and trying out the testnet. You can also stay up-to-date with the latest developments and updates by subscribing to the Verus newsletter, which provides regular recaps and updates on the project's progress.\n\nDo you have any questions about the testnet or the protocol's features? Or would you like more information on how to get started with testing and exploring the Verus protocol?",

I\u2019ll keep things short and to the point.\nVerus Protocol First Release Candidate (RC1) Live on Testnet\nThe first release candidate for the Verus protocol is now live on testnet. Anyone can launch (no programming needed) blockchains and currencies. Including DeFi at the protocol layer and a non-custodial Eth-bridge. Try the fully functional testnet now, and see what the future of decentralized multi-chain, multi-currency networks look like.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Download latest release on GitHub\n\u26a0\ufe0f Protocol developers are hard at work getting everything ready for mainnet. There is extra work being done on an additional security mechanism for chain notarizations on top of the ones that are already in place. This addition benefits the protocol greatly making it more robust.",
