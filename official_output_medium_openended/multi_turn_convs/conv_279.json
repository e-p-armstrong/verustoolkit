    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI heard that the Verus community on Discord was targeted by a hacking group. Can you tell me more about what happened and how the community responded to the attack?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, unfortunately, the Verus community on Discord was indeed targeted by a hacking group. Let me fill you in on the details.\n\nThe hacking group exploited a Discord session hijack vulnerability to gain control of the Discord server. They used social engineering tactics to establish trust with a member of the community, posing as journalists, and even collaborated on an article to gain credibility. However, their intentions were malicious, and they eventually used the vulnerability to take control of the server.\n\nFortunately, no funds on the Verus network or in Verus wallets were compromised due to this attack. The hackers were able to inflict significant damage on the Discord server, but the Verus network itself was not affected.\n\nThe Verus community responded quickly to the attack, launching an investigation to determine the extent of the damage. We were able to identify the methods used by the hackers, including the combination of social engineering and the Discord session hijack vulnerability. We also identified areas where Discord could improve its security, such as reducing false positive account disablements and improving response times to critical support requests.\n\nOne of the most important things we did was share our experience with the attack to warn other communities that use Discord and to help prevent similar attacks in the future. We emphasized the importance of being vigilant and cautious when interacting with unknown individuals, even if they appear to be legitimate. Overall, the Verus community's response to the attack was swift and effective, and it helped to minimize the damage and prevent any further compromise of funds or sensitive information.\n\nDo you have any further questions about this incident, or would you like to know more about how to stay safe from similar attacks in the future?",

We hope that the hackers were unable to fool anyone into giving up the funds from their Metamask or other Web wallets and that the criminals\u2019 efforts resulted in a negative return.\nThis should be a cautionary tale for any communities using Discord, and we will detail what we experienced, in hopes that it might prevent another Discord community from experiencing the same or similar issues. The hackers used a Discord session hijack vulnerability that is currently in use across some notorious hacking groups along with social engineering to inflict significant damage on the Discord server where the Verus community spends much of its time when coordinating. These attacks had no effect on the Verus network, and although the hackers did get control of the Discord server, they did not need to get full control or credentials for any account to inflict their damage on the Discord server. We believe the attack could easily have been cut short immediately if Discord could improve their false positive account disablement as well as their response time to critical support requests.\nWhat we have determined so far:\n1. The group targeted me and worked to establish trust as journalists for weeks, always persistent, never pushy. After working with me on an article, where I contributed the following content (Verus Article from Hack).\n2. Aft",
