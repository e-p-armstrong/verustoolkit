    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand more about Verus's transaction pricing system and its PBaaS technology. Can you explain the advantages of these systems and how they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you understand the benefits of Verus's transaction pricing system and PBaaS technology.\n\nThe advantage of Verus's transaction pricing system lies in its ability to calculate prices simultaneously for all transactions in a block. This ensures that all participants receive the same price in all directions of conversion, eliminating the possibility of price manipulation or unfair treatment. With this system, all transactions are treated equally and priced transparently, creating a fair and trustworthy environment for users.\n\nNow, let's talk about Verus's PBaaS (Platform-Based-as-a-Service) technology. This innovative feature allows anyone to create their own blockchain, independently and rent-free. This means that individuals or organizations can create customized blockchains tailored to their specific needs, without relying on a third-party service provider. These blockchains are fully interoperable with all other connected blockchains in the Verus network, enabling seamless communication and exchange of value between different chains.\n\nThe creation of independent blockchains using Verus's PBaaS technology is a powerful tool for innovation and decentralization. It enables the creation of customized blockchain solutions that can be tailored to specific use cases or industries, without the need for a centralized authority or intermediaries. This opens up new possibilities for decentralized applications, tokenization, and other use cases, and has the potential to drive significant growth and adoption in the blockchain space.\n\nDo you have any further questions about Verus's transaction pricing system or PBaaS technology? Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?",

Rent-free, independent and fully interoperable with all other connected blockchains in the network. See release notes for more extensive information on various launch options for currencies, tokens and blockchains.\nEthereum is the first network that has a decentralized bridge to Verus, and many networks will follow. The Verus community is excited to showcase these working technologies to the masses at Consensus 2022.\nPowerful Verus Community\nThe Verus community came together to make the attendance of Consensus 2022 possible and donated VRSC, BTC and ETH at an incredible combined amount of $150,000.
