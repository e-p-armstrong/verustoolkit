    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to wrap my head around Verus DeFi currencies. Can you explain how they work, and what are the concepts of liquidity pools, automated market makers, and fractional currencies in the context of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to break it down for you.\n\nIn the Verus DeFi ecosystem, a currency can be created and backed by a liquidity pool consisting of one or more reserve currencies. The value of the Verus DeFi currency is derived from the value of the currencies in its liquidity pool. For example, if a liquidity pool consists of VRSC and ETH, the value of the Verus DeFi currency will fluctuate based on the values of VRSC and ETH.\n\nThe liquidity pool acts as an automated market maker, which means that the price of the Verus DeFi currency is determined automatically based on the values of the currencies in the pool. This automated market maker ensures that there is always liquidity available, as anyone can interact with the currency at any time. The liquidity pool can never be empty, as users can always add or remove VRSC and ETH, and arbitrage opportunities arise when the balance tips too much to one side.\n\nHolding a Verus DeFi currency provides a constant-mix strategy, exposing the user to multiple currencies while only holding one. Additionally, users can earn fees from conversion transactions. The Verus DeFi currency can be backed by 100% of the liquidity pool, and multiple currencies can be used in the pool, offering various combinations.\n\nIn the Verus ecosystem, a currency with a liquidity pool attached is called a \"fractional currency,\" and the currencies in the pool are referred to as \"reserve currencies.\" The term \"fractional currency\" is used because the value of the currency is derived from the value of the reserve currencies, making it a fraction of their combined value.\n\nDo you have any further questions about Verus DeFi currencies, liquidity pools, or fractional currencies?",

            "idity pool of NewCurrency have a value of both $500. Consequently, the value of 1 NewCurrency is $1000 (C).\nImage 2: How the value of a Verus DeFi currency is composed\nSo, depending on what is in the liquidity pool of NewCurrency, the price of the currency fluctuates. Here comes the term \u2018automated market maker\u2019 in play. No person sets the price of the currency, it is fully automated. Anyone at any time can interact with this currency because there is always a value, and always liquidity. Which means it is an always \u2018on\u2019 market maker. A fully automated market maker.\nYou might ask yourself: why is there always liquidity? This is because a liquidity pool can never be really empty. One can always add or take out VRSC and ETH. When a balance tips too much to one side, there is opportunity to arbitrage and make money. There is always something to trade against.\nNow why would someone want to convert their VRSC or ETH to NewCurrency? This is a portfolio management choice. NewCurrency acts as a constant-mix strategy. You are exposed to two different currencies, while holding only one. By holding NewCurrency you also earn fees from people converting, more on this later.\nA Verus DeFi currency that is backed by 100% can have many more currencies than just two in its liquidity pool. All kinds of combinations are possible (image 3).\nImage 3: A currency backed by 100% can have many different currencies in its liquidity pool\nIn the Verus ecosystem we call a currency that has a pool of liquidity attached to it a \u2018fractional currency\u2019. The currencies that are in the pool of liquidity we call \u2018reserve currencies\u2019, see image 4.\nImage 4: Verus DeFi terminology\nTo make it a bit more complicated, let us explain why we call these currencies \u2018fractional currencies\u2019. In our example before (image 2) we showed a fractional currency that derives its value 100% from the reserve currencies: it is ",
