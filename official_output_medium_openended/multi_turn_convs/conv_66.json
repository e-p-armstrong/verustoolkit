    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus's Vault features, and I'm curious to know more about how they help users control and secure their assets. Can you explain how TimeLock, DelayLock, and revocation and recovery authorities work, and what's the purpose of VaultAlert.net?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus's Vault features are designed to provide users with advanced security and control over their assets. I'd be happy to break down each of these features and explain how they work.\n\nVerus's Vault features include two types of locks: TimeLock and DelayLock. These locks can be used to restrict access to assets stored in a Vault, and they can only be circumvented through the use of revocation and recovery authorities.\n\n**TimeLock:** With TimeLock, users can specify a period of time during which their assets will be locked and unable to be spent. This period can be up to 21 years. Once the specified time has elapsed, the assets will be unlocked and can be spent again.\n\n**DelayLock:** DelayLock allows users to lock their Vault and then request an unlock. However, before the assets can be spent again, a cooldown period must be waited out. This cooldown period is determined by the user when setting up the DelayLock.\n\n**Revocation and Recovery Authorities:** In the event that a user's Vault is compromised or they need to regain control of their assets, Verus's revocation and recovery authorities can be used. These authorities allow users to completely recover their assets into their own control. This feature provides an additional layer of security and ensures that users have ultimate control over their assets.\n\n**VaultAlert.net:** VaultAlert.net is a service that allows users to search for any VerusID and view information about the Vault's status. This includes information about the lock status, revocation and recovery authorities, and more. This service provides transparency and allows users to easily monitor the status of their Vaults.\n\nIn summary, Verus's Vault features provide users with advanced security and control over their assets, while VaultAlert.net provides transparency and monitoring capabilities. Do you have any further questions about these features or how they can be used to secure your assets?",

            "ompletely recover those assets into your own control. Read more here on how the revocation and recovery authorities function.\nTimeLock & DelayLock\nVault has two different options to lock your assets, TimeLock and DelayLock. You can only choose one option to lock the Vault. And the only way to circumvent a locked Vault is through revoking and recovering the VerusID.\nWith TimeLock you determine how long you want the Vault to be locked. After the determined period is over the assets can be spent again. The maximum amount of time the Vault can be locked is 21 years.\nWith DelayLock you determine a cooldown period. You lock the Vault and have to request an unlock. After requesting the unlock you have to wait for the determined cooldown period before the assets can be spent again.\nVaultAlert.net\nSo how does it work? You can search for any VerusID on VaultAlert.net and it shows you all you need to know about the Vault status and more.",
