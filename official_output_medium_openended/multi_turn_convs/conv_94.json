    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in DeFi protocols and I've heard that Verus has some impressive capabilities. Can you tell me more about what the Verus multichain DeFi protocols can do, and how I can access them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multichain DeFi protocols are indeed very powerful and offer a range of exciting capabilities. Without requiring any programming knowledge, users can create and manage multiple identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. These capabilities include:\n\n* Creating new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for various use cases, such as businesses, governments, projects, or personal purposes.\n* Sending currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease.\n* Converting currencies to others on the network without the need for an exchange, by sending to oneself and converting along the way.\n\nThese features are currently available on the Verus testnet, which is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. The Verus community is actively working on hardening and preparing the testnet protocols for mainnet release.\n\nIf you want to try out these capabilities, you can access the Verus testnet through the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets. Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) offers a range of capabilities that go beyond those available on other decentralized platforms, making it a powerful tool for creating and managing complex blockchain-based systems.\n\nWould you like to know more about how to get started with the Verus testnet or PBaaS? Or do you have any other questions about the capabilities of the Verus multichain DeFi protocols?",
