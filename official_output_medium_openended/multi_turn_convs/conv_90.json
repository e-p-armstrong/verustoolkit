    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in understanding how Verus's cross-chain transaction system works. Can you explain the process and the roles of relayers, validators, and notaries in this process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus's cross-chain transaction system is a fascinating topic. I'd be happy to break it down for you.\n\nVerus's cross-chain transaction system is designed to allow for seamless and secure transactions between different blockchain networks, including PBaaS chains and other systems like Ethereum. This is achieved through a process called \"cross-chain bundling,\" where bundles of transactions are exported from one chain or system and imported to another.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Transaction Bundling:** Transactions are bundled together on the source network according to the network's rules and protocol.\n2. **Relaying:** Relayers, who are incentivized by validation fees, shuttle these bundles of transactions between chains and networks.\n3. **Validation:** Validators on the destination network validate the transactions in the bundle using cryptographic proofs, such as PATRICIA Trie proofs for Ethereum transactions and Verus Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) method for PBaaS chains.\n4. **Notarization:** Notaries, who are responsible for witnessing the validity of notarizations, agree or disagree with the network validators' earned notarizations.\n\nIt's important to note that notaries have no control over what transactions are included in a bundle or the order in which they arrive. Their primary role is to agree or disagree with the network validators' earned notarizations.\n\nThe system is designed to prevent MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) and ensure that transactions are delivered to the destination network in the order they were created on the source network. Additionally, the system allows for arbitrage transactions to be added when the destination is a PBaaS chain, but the relayer cannot affect the provable source contents of a relayed bundle.\n\nOverall, Verus's cross-chain transaction system provides a secure, decentralized, and efficient way to transfer value between different blockchain networks.\n\nDo you have any further questions about this process or the roles of relayers, validators, and notaries?",

            "ndles of transactions exported from one chain or system and imported to another. Even Ethereum transactions are proven in both directions using the same workflow, although Ethereum transactions are validated using PATRICIA Trie proofs, while PBaaS chains use the Verus Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) method, both being cryptographically sound. Cross-chain bundles of transactions follow the same bundling protocol when sourced from Verus or PBaaS chains as is followed in DeFi to prevent MEV.\nTransactions are always delivered to the destination network with bundles in the order they were created on the source network and according to the enforceable rules of the source network. Since a relayer may add arbitrage transactions when the destination is a PBaaS chain, but may not affect the provable source contents of a relayed bundle from one network to another, no restriction is placed on who relays a valid bundle of transactions. Since validators who relay and mine or stake transaction bundles into a block may earn a validation fee from the import transaction itself, validators or notaries will generally shuttle transaction bundles between chains and networks out of self interest, while having no ability whatsoever to censor or modify protocol level bundles.\nWhat witness / notaries do NOT do\nWitnesses / notaries have no control over what transactions are or are not included or the order in which they arrive from one system to another, as all of that is dictated by the protocol. By default, notaries cannot create notarizations and can only witness the validity of notarizations already created and agreed to by both proof of work and proof of stake validators.\nWitness notaries\u2019 primary role is to agree or disagree with the network validators\u2019 earned notarizations, which are earned on one blockchain and accepted on another chain or system.
