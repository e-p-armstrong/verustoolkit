    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into different blockchain platforms and I'm curious about what makes Verus unique in its approach to building a decentralized network. Can you tell me more about that, and what key primitives Verus believes are essential for a foundational blockchain system to support global scale distributed systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus takes a distinct approach to building a decentralized network, which sets it apart from other blockchain platforms. Unlike Ethereum and its imitators, Verus doesn't rely on creating a basic blockchain structure with languages running on top to provide a basis for applications. Instead, Verus believes that security, sovereignty, privacy, and interoperability should be wired into the core protocol, not added at a second or third layer.\n\nVerus's philosophy is centered around the idea that blockchain/application structures that prioritize application development over security and scalability are fundamentally difficult to secure and scale. For example, when the blockchain doesn't understand the finance on top of it, fees can create perverse incentives, leading to security problems. This is because the application layer conflicts with the consensus layer.\n\nTo address this, Verus includes key primitives at the consensus level of the protocol to provide security and scalability. These primitives are essential ingredients for a foundational blockchain system to support the new era of global scale distributed systems. Some of the crucial primitives that Verus believes are necessary include payment, among others.\n\nBy incorporating these primitives into the protocol, Verus aims to create a decentralized network that is secure, scalable, and interoperable, with a strong focus on sovereignty and privacy. This approach sets Verus apart from other blockchain platforms and enables it to support large-scale decentralized systems that are reliable and efficient.\n\nDo you have any follow-up questions about Verus's approach or the key primitives that make it unique?",

            "lly high number of active nodes (both miners and stakers) in proportion to its market cap, which would be expected to grow further as system take-up grows. A recent estimate from a continuously connected node at the home of a community member showed it had seen over 20,000 node addresses.\nFoundational Blockchains Require Key Primitives\nThe Verus vision is to extend the decentralized network through additional primitives and to make these primitives a first class part of the protocol. The primitives are those necessary to form a reliable foundation for an emerging global distributed network of services. Applications and networks will be built on a basis where security, sovereignty, privacy and interoperability are wired into the core protocol, not added at a second or third layer. This philosophy is quite different from Ethereum and its imitators, which have created very basic blockchain structures as the foundation, with languages running on top that create a sequential computer, in order to provide a basis for applications (where finance, privacy, sovereignty, data and interoperability are intended to be provided by arbitrary applications developers). Verus is convinced that blockchain/application structures of this type are fundamentally difficult to secure and scale. For example, the blockchain doesn\u2019t understand the finance on top of it and so fees can create perverse incentives thus creating security problems. Simply put, the application layer conflicts with the consensus layer.\nInstead, security and scalability can be provided by including key primitives at the consensus level of the protocol. In its current thinking, Verus believes that the following primitives are crucial ingredients for a foundational blockchain system to support the new era of global scale distributed systems:\nPayment \u2014 the last decade shows that large decentralized systems are based on valu",
