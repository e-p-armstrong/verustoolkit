    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the concept of Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) on the Verus network. Can you explain what it is and how it enables the creation of public blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPublic Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) is a fascinating technology that allows for the decentralized and automated creation of public blockchains. I'd be happy to break it down for you.\n\nOn the Verus network, PBaaS enables anyone with a small amount of VerusCoin (or Verus Test Coin) to define and launch their own public blockchain in a matter of minutes. This is made possible through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) wallet, where users can easily create and configure their own blockchain.\n\nOnce created, any miner on the Verus network can see the new chain and merge-mine it with Verus, along with 13 other chains. This means that the hash power of Verus miners will also apply to the new chain, providing additional security and protection against various forms of attack.\n\nMoreover, the new chain is automatically cross-validated through Verus, further bolstering its security and decentralization. This technology enables the creation of a highly scalable, decentralized, and secure ecosystem of blockchain applications, making it easy for anyone to participate and create their own blockchain-based projects.\n\nIf you're interested in getting started with creating a public blockchain on the Verus Testnet, you can follow a simple guide that involves downloading the GUI Wallet Tech Release, starting the Verus Test chain, and configuring your new blockchain. If any issues arise, you can seek help from the Verus community or refer to the FAQ page for troubleshooting.\n\nDo you have any more questions about PBaaS or creating public blockchains on the Verus network?",

            "their ideas to life. This is why Verus was created. Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) enables a decentralized, automated experience to not only the use of blockchains, but their creation as well.\nUsing an intuitive GUI wallet, anyone with a little bit of VerusCoin (or Verus Test Coin for now), has the ability to define and start up their own public blockchain in minutes. Any miner will be able to see your new chain as soon as it\u2019s created, and merge-mine your chain with Verus, along with 13 other chains as well, meaning, they\u2019re hashpower on Verus will apply to your chain too. Through this process, your chain is also automatically cross-validated through Verus, bolstering it\u2019s security, and making it immune to multiple different forms of attack.\nThis technology allows for the creation of a near infinitely scalable, completely decentralized, secure ecosystem of blockchain applications, that you can easily be a part of.\nBut don\u2019t trust me, verify my claims yourself on the VerusCoin test-net by following a simple guide.\nHow to create your own chain on the Verus Testnet\n1 \u2013 Download the GUI Wallet Tech Release\nTo get started, simply head to this GitHub page, and download the latest desktop wallet for your operating system.\n2 \u2013 Start the Verus Test chain\nClick Add Coin, select VRSCTEST, and select \u201cActivate Coin\u201d. This will either spin up VRSCTEST, or, you\u2019ll be prompted to download any required ZCash parameters. If prompted, choose a server, and download the parameters. After the download is done, redo this step.\nIf you\u2019re having trouble getting it to start, don\u2019t worry! Check out this FAQ page, or ask the community for help in one of the Verus Discord channels here.",
