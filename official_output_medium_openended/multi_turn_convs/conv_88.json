    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand how Verus's multichain protocol works. Can you explain how it enables the export of currencies between PBaaS-blockchains, and what are the implications of this feature for transaction fees?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to break it down for you.\n\nVerus's multichain protocol allows for the seamless export of currencies between PBaaS-blockchains, enabling a high degree of interoperability and flexibility within the network. This means that a currency can be easily made available on multiple blockchains, expanding its reach and utility.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's consider an example: suppose we have a CHICKEN-currency on a PBaaS-chain and want to make it available on the Verus-blockchain as well. We can export the CHICKEN-currency to the Verus-blockchain for a fee, which is defined by the PBaaS-chain where the currency is being exported to. Once exported, the CHICKEN-currency becomes available on the Verus-blockchain, and can be used for transactions and other purposes.\n\nOne of the key benefits of this feature is that it enables the use of any currency available in the bridge-converter as a fee for transactions on any PBaaS-blockchain. This means that users no longer need to hold the native currency of the blockchain to perform transactions. For instance, if you have USDC on the Verus-blockchain, you can use it to send transactions without needing to hold VRSC, the native currency of the Verus-blockchain. The bridge-converter automatically converts a small fee of USDC to VRSC, which is then used as the transaction fee.\n\nThis feature has significant implications for the Verus ecosystem, as it increases the flexibility and usability of the network. By allowing users to choose from a range of currencies for transaction fees, Verus makes it easier for users to interact with the network, regardless of the currencies they hold. Additionally, this feature enables the development of more complex use cases, such as decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which can leverage the multichain protocol to create more sophisticated and interconnected systems.\n\nDo you have any further questions about how Verus's multichain protocol works, or how it can benefit the ecosystem?",

            "Last month a lot of quiet progress was made on the development of the Verus multichain protocol. A new public testnet is on the verge of release with additional core protocol features. All effort is put into making Verus a decentralized and robust protocol that just works.\nExporting Currencies\nCurrencies on one PBaaS-blockchain can be exported to any other PBaaS-blockchain. This means that a currency can easily be made available on multiple blockchains.\nAn example: we have CHICKEN-currency on a PBaaS-chain and want it to be available on the Verus-blockchain as well. We export CHICKEN-currency to the Verus-blockchain for a fee and now CHICKEN-currency is available there too. It goes without saying that all fees go to the miners and stakers of the network.\nWe can pay this fee in whatever currency we want, as long as it is available in the bridge-converter.\nThis fee is defined by the PBaaS-chain where you want the currency to be exported to, and thus can differ within all the multiple blockchains in the network.\nFee Structures\nOn the previous public testnet you could only make transactions if you had the native currency of the blockchain. Now you can use any currency that is in the bridge-converter as a fee to do operations on any PBaaS-blockchain.\nAny currency on a blockchain can be used as fees to do transactions. Example: if you have USDC on the Verus-blockchain you don\u2019t need VRSC to send the USDC around. It automatically converts a small fee of USDC to VRSC through a bridge-converter and uses that as its transaction fee.\nThis is an incredibly hard problem to solve. Yet it is working now on internal Verus test builds.",
