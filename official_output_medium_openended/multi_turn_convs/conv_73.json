    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to wrap my head around the Verus DeFi ecosystem, and I'm not entirely sure how liquidity pools, automated market makers, and fractional currencies work together. Can you explain how these components function in Verus DeFi, and what are the key concepts and terminology used in this context?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to break down these concepts for you! \n\nIn the Verus DeFi ecosystem, liquidity pools, automated market makers, and fractional currencies are fundamental components that enable decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities. Understanding these concepts is crucial to grasping how Verus DeFi works.\n\nA **liquidity pool** is a pool of funds that is attached to a specific currency. This pool can contain multiple currencies, and the value of the attached currency is determined by the assets in the liquidity pool. In Verus, all currencies with liquidity pools have adaptive supplies, meaning that the supply of the currency can change dynamically based on market conditions.\n\nAn **automated market maker** (AMM) is a system that provides liquidity to a market or currency. In Verus DeFi, the AMM is responsible for maintaining the liquidity pool and ensuring that it remains balanced. The AMM does not involve human traders; instead, it uses algorithms to manage the liquidity pool and facilitate trades.\n\nA **fractional currency** is a currency that is not fully backed by a underlying asset, but rather by a fraction of it. In Verus DeFi, fractional currencies are created by combining different currencies in a liquidity pool. The value of the fractional currency is determined by the weighted average of the underlying assets in the pool.\n\nTo illustrate how this works, let's consider an example. Suppose we have a new currency called NewCurrency, which is 100% backed by a liquidity pool containing 1000 VRSC and 2 ETH. In this case, the value of NewCurrency is equally divided between VRSC and ETH, despite their different values outside the Verus ecosystem. This means that VRSC and ETH each represent 50% of the value of NewCurrency.\n\nIn summary, the Verus DeFi ecosystem utilizes liquidity pools, automated market makers, and fractional currencies to provide decentralized finance capabilities. These components work together to enable the creation of new currencies, facilitate trades, and maintain liquidity in the market.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these concepts, or would you like me to elaborate on any of them?",

In this first vBasics-series, we explain what liquidity pools, automated market makers and fractional currencies are, and how they function in the Verus ecosystem.Verus is a foundational blockchain that builds key primitives at the consensus level of the protocol. DeFi is one of those key primitives, and quite difficult to wrap our heads around. Especially as the words we use can be confusing. This is new technology so we make it up as we go. DeFi systems we know use words like \u2018automated market makers\u2019 and \u2018liquidity pools\u2019. Verus adds \u2018fractional currency\u2019 to the terminology.\nIn a DeFi system there are no people you buy or sell your currency to. You only interact with a pool of liquidity. Inside this pool of liquidity can be many different currencies, small or large amounts. The liquidity pool is attached to a currency. The currency that is attached to the liquidity pool has a value that is determined by what is in the liquidity pool (image 1).\nImportant note: in the Verus ecosystem, all currencies with liquidity pools have adaptive supplies.\nImage 1: In Verus DeFi a currency can have a pool of liquidity attached to it\nLet\u2019s start by explaining currencies that are backed by 100% (see image 2). In our example we have NewCurrency. This currency is backed by 100% and has VRSC and ETH in its liquidity pool (A).\nIn a currency that is 100% backed, the value is always equally divided by the number of currencies in the liquidity pool. NewCurrency has 1000 VRSC and 2 ETH in its liquidity pool. And even though they are different values, and they have different values outside the Verus ecosystem, they still represent 50/50% of the value (B).\nLet\u2019s say the currencies in the liqu",
