    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm concerned about the security of our Discord server. What are some security concerns related to Discord servers and how can they be mitigated?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Security concerns related to Discord servers are a top priority. Let me break it down for you.\n\nSecurity concerns related to Discord servers include the risk of session hijacking, where an attacker gains control of an account by exploiting a vulnerability, and the potential for scammers to announce fraudulent giveaways or phishing links that can compromise users' assets on various blockchain networks.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it's essential to implement robust security measures. Here are some best practices to follow:\n\n1. **Secure login credentials**: Ensure that login credentials are not compromised, and avoid clicking on suspicious links that may expose your account to session hijacking.\n2. **Verify announcements**: Be cautious of announcements on Discord servers, especially those claiming to offer fraudulent giveaways or promotions. Verify the authenticity of such announcements before engaging with them.\n3. **Use secure wallets**: When interacting with blockchain networks, use secure wallets like Metamask to minimize the risk of asset theft.\n4. **Implement access controls**: Ensure that Discord server administrators have proper access controls in place, such as multi-factor authentication and secure password management, to prevent unauthorized access to the server.\n5. **Monitor server activity**: Regularly monitor server activity to detect and respond to potential security threats in a timely manner.\n6. **Establish communication channels**: Establish open communication channels between server administrators and members to report suspicious activity and provide timely warnings.\n7. **Have a disaster recovery plan**: Have a plan in place to recover from security breaches, including procedures for regaining control of compromised accounts and servers.\n\nBy following these security best practices, you can minimize the risk of security breaches on Discord servers and protect your community from potential threats.\n\nDo you have any more questions about Discord server security or would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?",

            "er they said they had completed their article, they worked for 2 days on getting me to accept a content release form, even rewriting it after I refused to agree to their first version.\n3. Once they rewrote it, I clicked a link from their Discord server, and although they weren\u2019t able to get login credentials, they exploited a session hijack link, and immediately went to work.\n4. After they had my account, which had setup the Discord server so many years ago, under their control, they kicked off all admins, installed their own admins, and did something that Discord would have to help explain that got Discord to instantly ban my account, the only one besides Discord that could have kicked them off.\n5. Since then, they started announcing scam links, claiming fraudulent giveaways with Ethereum tokens backed by Verus on websites that if someone with a Metamask or similar wallet engages with, there is a risk of taking assets from them on Ethereum or possibly other networks, not Verus.\n6. We still have not heard from or gotten help from Discord Support since this event began, except that they banned my account, and to our knowledge the scammers are still in the old Verus Discord server attempting to scam an ever dwindling group of members who haven\u2019t left by now.\n7. If you know anyone in the old Discord, please inform them to leave the Discord asap and not engage in any of the announcements, as they are made by impersonators, while people trying to warn are banned and the original admins are locked out of the server.\n8. My old Discord ID is now disabled by Discord, and I no longer have access to our conversations. My new account is miketout.vrsc (this ID), which is not the owner of this Discord, and we have implemented a set of processes for all Discord admins to prevent any such event from occurring again.\nSince the Verus Community is much more than a Discord Server, though",
