            "What are social tokens, and how can they be transformed from one-dimensional curiosities into widely usable currencies with reliable real-world value?",
            "Social tokens are digital currencies that allow creators to capture the value created by their community. In the past, social tokens had limited capabilities, only allowing for basic transactions and inclusion in liquidity pools. However, with new technical capabilities, social tokens can be transformed into widely usable currencies that carry reliable real-world value.\n\nThe first generation of social tokens had one-dimensional technical features, which made it difficult for them to create actual value. They could be related to off-chain economic activity, but they didn't have any on-chain economics, making their value aspirational, not provable, reliable, or predictable.\n\nHowever, with the advent of new technologies, social tokens can now be designed to have built-in direct liquidity, stable and predictable values, and attached namespaces that enable a full spectrum digital goods economy centered on the token. This allows for real value creation that is direct and measurable through on-chain economic activity, such as NFTs, fan profiles, memorabilia, tickets, discount codes, coupons, log-in unlocks, and more.\n\nWith these capabilities, social tokens can attract speculators who can measure and predict engagement, leading to real value creation. The Verus project, with its built-in blockchain primitives, provides a platform for creating social tokens with these advanced capabilities, enabling creators to capture the value created by their community and build substantial and automated economies centered around the token.",
