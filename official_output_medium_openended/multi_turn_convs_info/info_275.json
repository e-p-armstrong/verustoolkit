            "What initially drew you to the Verus community and what aspects of the project stood out to you as a developer?",
            "Initially, I was introduced to Verus through a friend who mentioned that it was a CPU mineable cryptocurrency. At first, I was not particularly impressed, as I, like many others in the mainstream crypto community, believed CPU mining to be an outdated method. However, when I finally decided to explore Verus and learn more about the project, I was struck by two key aspects.\n\nFirstly, I noticed that there was no centralized \"team\" behind Verus. Instead, the project was open to contributors who could join the community as equals. This decentralized approach resonated with me, as it aligned with the principles of blockchain technology.\n\nSecondly, I was impressed by the high-quality development work being done on Verus. As a developer myself, I was able to appreciate the technical aspects of the project and was struck by the lack of hype and fanfare surrounding it. Verus seemed to be focused on quietly building a robust and reliable platform, rather than seeking to generate excitement and attention.\n\nThese two factors, combined with the project's vision of creating a more equitable and honest economic framework, resonated with me and drew me to the Verus community.",

In a new era of blockchain where I, along with mostly everyone else in mainstream crypto, believed CPU mining was an inefficient and outdated method best kept tucked away with the Bitcoin whitepaper and those lucky bastards who first mined BTC in its inception days, this sounded cool but didn\u2019t really impress me, in and of itself.\nWhen I finally decided to head over to Verus and take a look at what the project was all about, I felt like a sea-weary sailor spotting a glimpse of a distant lighthouse\u2026if I dare sound a little corny\u2026 but was still uncertain how sure the ground was, upon which it claimed to be founded.\nPeople and Development Strong\nI immediately noticed two things about the project: first, there was no \u201cteam\u201d, just contributors with the invitation to join the community as yet another member. Second, the project was quietly doing the best development work I had seen yet, without any glitz or glam.
