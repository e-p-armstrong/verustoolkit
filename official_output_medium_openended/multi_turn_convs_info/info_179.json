            "How does one define a currency on the Verus Testnet blockchain, and what are the costs associated with doing so? Additionally, how can one fund their VerusID with vETH to cover these costs, and what is the command to define a currency mapped to an ERC-20 contract address?",
            "Defining a currency on the Verus Testnet blockchain involves several steps and associated costs.\n\n**Costs:**\nThe cost of defining a currency on Verus Testnet is 200 VRSCTEST, which is distributed to the miners and stakers of the blockchain. However, these costs can vary depending on the specific blockchain you want to define a currency on. When launching PBaaS-chains, you can define your own costs in the chain's native currency.\n\n**Funding VerusID with vETH:**\nTo cover the costs of defining a currency, you need to fund your VerusID with vETH. There are two ways to do this:\n\n1. **Send ETH to Verus (into vETH) using the Verus-Ethereum bridge:** This method involves sending Ethereum (ETH) to Verus, which is then converted into vETH.\n2. **Convert VRSCTEST or any other currency into vETH using Verus' protocol-level DeFi:** This method involves using Verus' decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities to convert VRSCTEST or other currencies into vETH.\n\n**Defining the Currency:**\nOnce you have funded your VerusID with vETH, you can define the currency using the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"MaxUSDC\", \n  \"options\":32, \n  \"systemid\":\"veth\", \n  \"parent\":\"vrsctest\", \n  \"launchsystemid\":\"vrsctest\", \n  \"nativecurrencyid\":{\n    \"type\":9, \n    \"address\":\"0x98339D8C260052B7ad81c28c16C0b98420f2B46a\"\n  }, \n  \"initialsupply\":0, \n  \"proofprotocol\":3\n}'\n```\n\nThis command defines a currency called MaxUSDC, which is mapped to the ERC-20 USDC contract address on Etherscan. The `nativecurrencyid` field specifies the type and address of the ERC-20 contract, and the `initialsupply` field sets the initial supply of the currency to 0.",
