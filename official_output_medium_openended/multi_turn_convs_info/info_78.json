            "What are the key features and improvements of Sapling technology in Verus, and how do they enhance the security, performance, and usability of shielded transactions?",
            "Sapling technology in Verus introduces several key features and improvements that enhance the security, performance, and usability of shielded transactions. Here are some of the main benefits:\n\n**New Shielded Address Format:**\nSapling introduces a new address format that begins with \"zs\", which allows for shorter shielded addresses. These new addresses can be generated at scale within a wallet without computational cost, making it ideal for enterprises and exchanges that need to create a large number of z-addresses.\n\n**Improved Performance:**\nShielded transactions with the new \"zs\" addresses utilize Sapling's performance upgrades, which enable fast transaction construction and low memory usage. This makes it possible to perform shielded transactions on mobile or IoT devices, which was not previously possible.\n\n**Decoupling Spend Authority:**\nSapling introduces split spending and proving keys, which allows the spending key to be stored independently of the proving key. This enhances security by enabling the use of a separate or untrusted device for complex tasks without posing a risk to the spending key.\n\n**Zcash Parameters:**\nNew Zcash parameters for Sapling are downloaded, and they are much smaller than earlier parameters.\n\n**Improved Keys:**\nViewing keys will support incoming and outgoing transaction detail viewing for owners, allowing them to view or share the new full viewing key with a trusted party without exposing their spending key.\n\nOverall, Sapling technology in Verus provides significant improvements in security, performance, and usability for shielded transactions, making it more practical and accessible for a wide range of use cases.",
            "ing viewing keys for Sapling addresses, which is not required for normal transactions, is not yet supported, and will be included in the next Sapling technology update.\nVerus will activate Sapling at Verus block height 227520. With each VerusCoin block approximately 60s, the estimated date for Sapling activation is October 30, 2018. Use the VerusCoin Explorer for the exact current block height.\nLearn more in-depth detail about Sapling here.\nNew Shielded Address Format & Improved Wallets\nA new address format introduces shorter shielded addresses which begin with \u201czs\u201d.\nSapling z-address format begins with \u201czs\u201d as in\nzs1z7rejlpsa98s2rrrfkwmaxu53e4ue0ulcrw0h4x5g8jl04tak0d3mm47vdtahatqrlkngh9sly\nThese new addresses can also be generated at scale within a wallet without computational cost, allowing enterprises and exchanges the flexibility of creating trillions of z-addresses in advance or on the fly.\nPerformance for New \u201czs\u201d Addresses\nShielded transactions with new zs addresses will utilize Saplings performance upgrades wherein payments can be constructed in a few seconds or even <1 second and use as little as 40 MB of memory. Shielded transactions are now possible on mobile or IoT devices.\nDecoupling Spend Authority\nSapling introduces split spending and proving keys. The spending key, used to sign transactions and generate a proving key, is now able to be stored independent of the proving key. The proving key, which handles the complex tasks can be on a separate or untrusted device without posing any risk.\nZcash Params\nNew Zcash parameters for Sapling will be downloaded, and are much smaller than earlier params.\nImproved Keys (coming soon)\nViewing keys now support incoming and outgoing transaction detail viewing for owners. An owner can view or share the new full viewing key with a trusted party without exposing their spending key and provide visibility to outbound transa",
