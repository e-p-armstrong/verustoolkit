            "To set up and start mining Verus Coin on your computer, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Unzip the Mining Folder and Edit the \"start\" File**\nFirst, unzip the compressed folder containing the mining software to an easily accessible location, such as your Desktop. Open the folder and locate the \"start\" file. Using a text editor, customize the top section of the \"start\" script file with the following information:\n\n* The pool Host and Port you've decided to use\n* Your Verus Coin public address (which you should have copied earlier)\n* An optional \"worker name\" (helpful if you're mining from multiple devices)\n* The number of \"Threads\" you want your system to mine with (you can find out how many threads your CPU has by doing a simple Google search)\n\n**Step 2: Save the \"start\" File and Prepare to Mine**\nAfter entering the custom data into the \"start\" file, be sure to save it! Now you're ready to mine.\n\n**Step 3: Open the Folder Containing the \"start\" Script and Run It**\nOpen the folder containing the \"start\" script (or maybe it's still open). In Linux, right-click inside the folder and select \"Open in Terminal\" from the dropdown menu. In Windows, simply open the folder containing the \"start.bat\" file. On a Mac, click Finder, Services, and select \"New Terminal at Folder\".\n\n**Step 4: Run the \"start\" Script**\nNow, run the \"start\" script! In Windows, simply double-click the \"start.bat\" file. If you encounter a security warning, click \"More info\" and then \"Run Anyway\". If you run into an error in Windows regarding a missing DLL, try installing the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3. In Mac and Linux, run the \"start.sh\" script as follows:\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to set up and start mining Verus Coin on your computer.",
            "Simply unzip the compressed folder to your Desktop or somewhere easy to access, then open the folder and use a text editor to edit the \u201cstart\u201d file within.\nStep 3\nCustomize the top section of the start script file with the pool Host and Port you\u2019ve decided to use, your Verus Coin public address you copied earlier, an optional \u201cworker name\u201d (useful if you are going to mine from many devices, so you can track how each is doing), and lastly, with a number representing how many \u201cThreads\u201d you want your system to mine with. You can find out how many threads your CPU has by doing a simple Google search.\nAfter entering the custom data into the start file, be sure to save it!Part 3 \u2014 Begin Mining!\nNow that you have your wallet and your start script is configured with it, along with the pool and thread settings, you\u2019re ready to mine! This part scares a lot of people, because you\u2019re running a \u201ccommand line\u201d script. But it\u2019s no sweat, I promise.\nStep 1\nOpen the folder containing the start script (or maybe it\u2019s still open) and, in Linux, right click inside the folder. From the drop down menu that appears, simply click \u201cOpen in Terminal\u201d. (In Windows simply open the folder containing the start.bat file.)\nOn a Mac, click Finder, Services, and select \u201cNew Terminal at Folder\u201d.\nStep 2\nNow simply run the start script!\nIn Windows you can simply double click the \u201cstart.bat\u201d file. Windows may give you a security warning, to bypass it click \u201cMore info\u201d and then \u201cRun Anyway\u201d.
