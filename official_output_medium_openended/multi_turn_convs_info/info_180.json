            "What are the main objectives of the Verus Coin software, and how do they contribute to realizing the Verus Vision of Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS)?",
            "The main objectives of the Verus Coin software are to optimize network performance and provide easier private, encrypted, notarized messages and an improved GUI.\n\nOptimizing network performance is crucial to ensure that the Verus network can handle a growing number of users and transactions efficiently. This involves making changes to the ratio of available connections to their consumers on the network and implementing anti-lag measures to ensure that the software is spending its time efficiently. This is essential to prevent synchronization lags and ensure a seamless user experience.\n\nThe second objective is to provide easier private, encrypted, notarized messages and an improved GUI. This involves enabling users to send and receive private encrypted memos with ease. The improved GUI allows users to view incoming private transactions and decode private encrypted memos, making it more user-friendly and accessible.\n\nThese objectives contribute to realizing the Verus Vision of Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) by laying the foundation for a robust and efficient blockchain network that can power public applications such as polling, voting, and decentralized identity. By achieving these objectives, Verus Coin is moving closer to its vision of creating a public blockchain that can be used as a service, enabling a wide range of applications and use cases.",
            "imary objectives:\nOptimized network performance\nAs the Verus network has grown rapidly in its early weeks and months of operation, some community users began reporting a lack of available connections into the Verus peer to peer network, resulting in synchronization lags. This release changes the ratio of available connections to their consumers quite significantly on the network. It also includes anti-lag measures to further ensure that the software is spending its time efficiently.\nEasier private, encrypted, notarized messages and improved GUI\nThe 0.3.11 software release enabled attaching a private encrypted memo when sending to a private z-address, but there has not been an easy way to view these messages in either the GUI or on the command line. The 0.3.12 release now adds all incoming private transactions to the transaction display and enables receipt and decoding of private encrypted memos.\nVersion 0.3.12 of the Verus Coin software is a step forward towards realizing the Verus Vision of Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) powering public applications, such as polling, voting, and decentralized identity.\nContact:\nVerus Coin Foundation: foundationrelease@veruscoin.io\nVisit the Website for software and white papers: https://veruscoin.io\nFollow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/VerusCoin\nSubscribe on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/VerusCoin/\nChat on Discord: https://discord.gg/MPXXJCm\nRepresentatives on Discord: miketout, englal, michaeltoutjr, VirtualSoundNW, Asher, crypto05",
