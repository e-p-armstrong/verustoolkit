            "What is the \"Nothing at Stake\" problem in Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain validation, and how can it be solved to strengthen the objectivity of the blockchain?",
            "The \"Nothing at Stake\" problem is a concern in Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain validation, where validators have an incentive to vote for multiple conflicting versions of the blockchain in order to increase their chances of earning a reward. This can lead to weak subjectivity, where the validity of the blockchain is uncertain.\n\nIn contrast, Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain validation is more secure because it relies on the \"most work\" rule, where the longest chain is considered the valid one. This approach makes it difficult for validators to cheat, as they would need to perform a significant amount of work to outweigh the existing chain.\n\nTo solve the \"Nothing at Stake\" problem, many previous attempts have focused on \"after the fact\" defense and punishment mechanisms. However, these approaches add complexity and can be costly in terms of performance. They also do not address the root cause of the problem, which is the incentive for validators to cheat.\n\nA more effective solution is to design a PoS system that removes the incentive for cheating in the first place. This can be achieved by introducing a new rule, such as the \"Chain Power\" rule, which makes it a losing proposition for validators to attempt to cheat. By doing so, the blockchain can achieve a higher level of objectivity, making it more secure and reliable.\n\nIn summary, the \"Nothing at Stake\" problem is a critical issue in PoS blockchain validation that can lead to weak subjectivity. To solve this problem, a new approach is needed that removes the incentive for cheating and introduces a more objective validation mechanism, such as the \"Chain Power\" rule.",
            "jectivity is a problem over a short period of time\u2026but not over a long period of time.\nIn the case of Proof of Stake vs Proof of Work, this becomes an area of concern for the validity and security of a blockchain, especially when measured against Proof of Work and validating a chain based on most work\u2026the longest chain or \u201cmost work\u201d rule.\nWithout \u201cmost work\u201d how would you strengthen the subjectivity of the blockchain, moving it towards a more objective chain?\nThe Race to Solve the Nothing at Stake Problem\nUntil now most attempts at solving this very critical theoretical problem are based in \u201cafter the fact\u201d defense and \u201cpunishment\u201d mechanisms to try to punish cheating which may occur.\nSuch solution attempts are not approaching the problem in the way which models Proof of Work\u2026wherein the cheating doesn\u2019t occur in the first place due to the design of the blockchain. Instead many are tacking on voting and approval systems which add complex layers and then have to \u201cdetangle\u201d the complexity of who\u2019s cheating, who\u2019s playing fair, and how to punish the cheaters.\nFrom proposals of complex, computationally heavy, time-costly and punishment-based approaches\u2026to centralized systems designed to analyze and choose the legitimate blocks and react to cheating\u2026every attempt at solving this problem to date, comes at either great cost of performance, principle, or complexity and convolution of code.\nIn short, most attempts are a reactionary approach which is not inherent within the PoS or blockchain code. What has always given PoW the upper hand is it\u2019s simplicity and implicity.\nSomething at Stake, Simply and Implicitly\nVerus has solved the problem of Nothing at Stake while removing Weak Subjectivity. This innovative improvement coming to the Verus blockchain is removing any incentive to attempt cheating, making it a losing proposition. This, combined with a new \u201cChain Power\u201d rule whi",
