            "What is Verus' technical philosophy, and how does it aim to create a paradigm shift in the decentralized internet?",
            "Verus' technical philosophy is centered around building a robust, secure, and scalable foundation for global-scale distributed and decentralized applications. The core idea is that the decentralized internet will not be a single, monolithic \"global computer\" but rather a network of heterogeneous systems exchanging data in a way that they can all understand. These systems may be centralized or decentralized, and they will trigger functionality from one system to another.\n\nVerus believes that secure systems should have their most important functions built into the protocol level. This approach is in line with Bell's Law, which states that every decade, a new, lower-priced computer class emerges based on a new programming platform, network, and interface, leading to new usage and the establishment of a new industry.\n\nThe current paradigm has led to the emergence of giant internet monopolies that abuse their power, stifle freedom and innovation, and compromise privacy and security. Verus aims to create a paradigm shift by providing a foundation for decentralized applications that are secure, scalable, and private. By building additional blockchain primitives into the consensus protocol, Verus creates a robust foundation for global-scale decentralized applications.\n\nIn essence, Verus' technical philosophy is focused on creating a decentralized internet that is heterogeneous, secure, and scalable, with functionality triggered from one system to another. This approach has the potential to create a new industry and bring about a significant paradigm shift in the way we think about decentralized systems.",
            "Title: Building the Foundations for a Paradigm Shift\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/building-the-foundations-for-a-paradigm-shift-3146a3adb56e\nContent:Verus Technical Philosophy: Building the Foundations for a Paradigm Shift\nVerus builds additional blockchain primitives into the consensus protocol in order to provide a robust, secure and scalable foundation for global scale distributed and decentralized apps. Verus\u2019 philosophy is that the decentralized internet will not emerge as a system of applications all programmed on a single \u201cglobal computer\u201d but that it will consist of heterogeneous systems exchanging data that they can all understand (some centralized, some decentralized). Functionality will be triggered from one system to another. Secure systems will include their most important functions at the protocol level.Bell\u2019s Law states that \u201croughly every decade a new, lower priced computer class forms based on a new programming platform, network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new industry\u201d. Experience shows that this shift comes into effect invisibly at first, and its nature is only widely understood and recognized some five to seven years after the shift began.\nWe know that the latest Bell\u2019s Law transformation is upon us, and has been for some years, but there is still scant agreement on its specific nature. What we can say for certain, though, is that we are in dire need of a great leap forward in systems, services and usage. Our most recent computing paradigm has given us new toys, tools and businesses. But it has also brought giant internet monopolies that routinely abuse their power and stifle freedom, innovation and wealth creation. This paradigm is noted for constant security breaches and a perceived impossibility to protect even our most important systems from intrusion. Privacy is a non-feature and is abused at w",
