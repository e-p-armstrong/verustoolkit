            "What is the concept of Verus Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) fractional reserve currencies, and how do they work in relation to the Verus ecosystem?",
            "Verus Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) is a technology that enables the creation of public blockchains that can operate independently, while still being part of the larger Verus ecosystem. One key feature of PBaaS is the concept of fractional reserve currencies.\n\nFractional reserve currencies are native currencies of PBaaS chains that choose to share liquidity across the Verus ecosystem. These currencies are backed by a certain amount of Verus Coin (VRSC) on the Verus blockchain, which serves as the reserve for those chains. The reserves can represent a varying percentage of the total market capitalization of a PBaaS blockchain, such as 100%, 50%, or 10%.\n\nThese fractional reserve currencies can be converted to and from Verus Coin in a fully automatic way, using simple transactions and PBaaS reserve protocols. This means that users can easily move value between different PBaaS chains and the Verus blockchain, allowing for a high degree of interoperability and flexibility.\n\nThe PBaaS reserve protocols enable the automatic conversion of Verus Coin to and from the native currencies of PBaaS chains. This process is designed to be seamless and efficient, allowing users to take advantage of the benefits of the Verus ecosystem while still maintaining the independence and autonomy of their own PBaaS chains.\n\nOverall, the concept of fractional reserve currencies is a key component of the Verus PBaaS technology, enabling the creation of a decentralized network of public blockchains that can operate together in a seamless and efficient manner.",

I\u2019ve put together this update on Verus PBaaS reserves, and the state of community development at the present to help briefly explain some things.\nAt any time and for virtually any volume, Verus will be convertible in a fully automatic way between Verus and native fractional reserve currencies through simple transactions and PBaaS reserve protocols.\nVerus fractional reserve currencies will be the native currencies of Verus PBaaS chains that choose to share liquidity across the Verus ecosystem. All PBaaS blockchains that are launched as Verus fractional reserves will control a certain amount of Verus Coin on the Verus blockchain that will serve as the reserves for those chains. The reserves may represent 100%, 50%, or even 10% of the total market cap of a PBaaS blockchain.\nExplaining the details of how these fractional reserve currencies work is not the purpose of this update.
