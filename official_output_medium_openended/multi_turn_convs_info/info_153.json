            "How does the Verus PBaaS protocol benefit the Verus ecosystem, and what advantages does it offer to reserve currency projects and users?",
            "The Verus PBaaS protocol is designed to create a thriving ecosystem where community-funded, fairly-launched reserve currency projects can flourish. One of the key benefits of the Verus PBaaS protocol is that it allows for fully decentralized and community-driven projects, with no central authority or company taking a cut of the transactions. This means that blockchain costs are paid directly to miners and stakers for verification, notarization, and initial conversion of Verus to the PBaaS reserve currency.\n\nAnother advantage of the Verus PBaaS protocol is that it enables the creation of reserve currencies with transparent and flexible contribution models. A range of 0-100% of the contributions to a reserve blockchain launch can be routed to the reserves of the fractional reserve currency, with the remainder being distributed transparently as determined by the project launchers.\n\nThe Verus PBaaS protocol also offers a unique advantage in that it eliminates the need for intermediaries or \"money changers\" in the process of converting currencies between chains. This reduces overhead costs and complexity, making it more efficient and user-friendly for users to move currency between chains.\n\nFurthermore, the Verus PBaaS protocol is designed to promote liquidity and adoption within the Verus ecosystem. As more people use the Verus PBaaS protocol, the more liquidity and value will be created, driving up the conversion price of the coins. This creates a positive feedback loop, where the more people who use the protocol, the more valuable it becomes.\n\nOverall, the Verus PBaaS protocol offers a range of benefits to reserve currency projects and users, including decentralization, transparency, flexibility, efficiency, and liquidity.",

As a fully decentralized protocol with no company to take a cut along the way, any blockchain costs to launch a PBaaS project on Verus are paid directly to miners and stakers for verification, notarization, and initial conversion of Verus to the PBaaS reserve currency. Any range of the contributions to a reserve blockchain launch, from 0\u2013100% of proceeds, can be transparently routed to the reserves of the fractional reserve currency, with the remainder being distributed, also transparently, as determined by those who launch the chain.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that we are not building these technologies to just talk about them or claim that we did something. We strongly believe that the world needs Verus PBaaS and fractional reserve currencies. Some of us are helping exciting new projects work on use cases in addition to those described in the Verus vision paper, and we fully expect these projects to leverage PBaaS reserve technologies.\nIn one very powerful sense, the Verus reserve ecosystem will have no need for and no overhead imposed by money changers, a virtue that is going to be more and more important as it grows.\nFinally, to introduce some specifics about what exactly has been going on in my deep, dark development hole for the past few weeks:\nWe realized that if the process of moving currency from one chain to another or converting currencies was too complex, fewer people would use it. That led to the idea that you should be able to send from Verus to XYZ chain and wait for your currency to arrive o",
