            "What features and improvements have been made to the Verus wallet, and what other developments have been completed to support the Verus blockchain?",
            "The Verus wallet has been improved to be more cutting-edge as a multi-coin wallet. Additionally, several issues have been fixed, including:\n\n* Non-Latin usernames causing the wallet to fail to load, which is now resolved.\n* The wallet balance getting out of sync with the blockchain when staking, which can be fixed by performing a Rescan. To do this, users can either add the `-rescan` parameter when starting the daemon using the Command Line Interface (CLI), or follow a series of steps in the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to activate the coin in Native mode with the `daemon param: rescan` option.\n\nFurthermore, Verus has completed two important developments to support the blockchain upgrade:\n\n* **Sapling Enabled Electrum Server**: Verus has enhanced their Electrum Server to support Sapling transactions, making Lite Mode Sapling Z-Transactions possible. This allows users to successfully handle Sapling transactions for Lite Mode of Verus and Zcash using the Verus Electrum server.\n* **Sapling Enabled Pool Software**: Verus has also coded Sapling compatible pool software, providing a fully functional and compatible solution for the community. This demonstrates Verus' commitment to excellence and providing high-quality solutions for its users.\n\nThese developments highlight Verus' focus on improving its wallet and blockchain infrastructure to provide a better experience for its users.",

Lead developer Mike Toutonghi first noticed that his attempts at finding an Electrum server which would support the new Sapling transactions, were fruitless.\nAs a result, Mike coded the support into the Verus Electrum server, which has been fully tested and seamlessly activated along with the blockchain Sapling activation at VerusCoin block height 227520.\nThe Verus Electrum server is able to be used to successfully handle Sapling transactions for \u201cLite Mode\u201d of Verus and Zcash from the latest Verus v0.4.0f wallet update. This support has been tested and is deployed on Verus\u2019 Electrum Server for use with all lite mode transactions.\nSapling Enabled Pool Software\nBeing thorough and excellent are two very important qualities to which Verus holds true. Providing fully Sapling compatible pool software is another example of this commitment to the community and the project.\nVerus has coded Sap",
