            "To set up staking and cheat catching with Verus, you need to follow several steps. Here's a detailed guide on how to do it:\n\n**Step 1: Launch the Verus Daemon**\nTo start staking and cheat catching, you need to launch the Verus daemon with the correct flags. Specifically, you need to use the `-mint` flag to enable minting (staking) and the `-cheatcatcher` flag to enable cheat catching. The command to launch the daemon is:\n```\n./verus-cli/verusd -mint -cheatcatcher=zsaddr\n```\nReplace `zsaddr` with your Sapling address.\n\n**Step 2: Shield Staked Coins**\nTo shield your staked coins, you need to create a script that uses the `z_shieldcoinbase` command. Here's an example script:\n```\n./verus-cli/verus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\" zsAddr\n```\nReplace `zsAddr` with your Sapling address.\n\n**Step 3: View Your zs Addr Balance**\nTo view your zs Addr balance, you can create a script that uses the `z_getbalance` command. Here's an example script:\n```\n./verus-cli/verus z_getbalance zsAddr\n```\nReplace `zsAddr` with your Sapling address.\n\n**Step 4: Unshield Coins**\nTo unshield coins, you need to use the `z_sendmany` command. Here's an example command:\n```\n./verus-cli/verus z_sendmany \"zsAddr\" \"[{\\\"address\\\": \\\"transparentAddr\\\", \\\"amount\\\":500}]\"\n```\nReplace `zsAddr` with your Sapling address, `transparentAddr` with your transparent address, and `500` with the amount of coins you want to unshield.\n\n**Step 5: Start Staking!**\nTo start staking, you need to launch the Verus daemon with the correct flags, as mentioned in Step 1. Make sure to use the correct Sapling address and transparent address.\n\n**Important Note**\nDo not use the same wallet on more than one server to stake the same coins. This is considered cheating and can result in your rewards being taken by other Cheat Catchers on the network.\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up staking and cheat catching with Verus, including shielding and unshielding coins.",

So for example, to launch the Verus daemon to Stake and Cheat Catch, you would launch it as:\n ./verus-cli/verusd -mint -cheatcatcher=zsaddr\nScript 1 \u2014 Shield Staked Coins\nCreate a new script using nano (maybe call it shield.sh) and enter the following, changing the zsAddr to your new zsAddress you generated in Task 3 above:\n./verus-cli/verus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\" zsAddr\nScript 2 \u2014 View Your zs Addr Balance\nYou\u2019ll see the zsAddr balance change once the shielding has finished. Create a new script using nano and enter the following, changing zsAddr to your new zsAddress:\n./verus-cli/verus z_getbalance zsAddr\nUnshield Coins Command Line\nTo unshield you\u2019ll want to issue the command so you can control the amount of coins. There is a way to create variables in a script but I also like verifying addresses are correct, etc.\nTo unshield coins, you\u2019ll issue the following command, putting your zsAddr and tAddr and the correct number of coins for the amount:\n./verus-cli/verus z_sendmany \"zsAddr\" \"[{\\\"address\\\": \\\"transparentAddr\\\", \\\"amount\\\":500}]\"\nStep 5: Begin Staking!\nAgain, you will start the daemon with:\n ./verus-cli/verusd -mint -cheatcatcher=zsaddr where \u201czsaddr\u201d is your \u201czs\u201d Sapling address you generated above in Task 3.\nYou are now staking and your node is looking for cheats to catch!\nNOTE: Do not use the same wallet on more than one server to stake the same coins. That is considered cheating and any rewards staked while cheating can be taken by other Cheat Catchers on the network. Learn more here.\nIf you are starting a new wallet on this Droplet, you\u2019ll simply want to send VRSC to your new Transparent Wallet address in sends of 500 or fewer coins. This is ideal for staking as it will create a new UTXO for each send to the wallet. After 150 confirmations the coins will be staking!\nWith the scripts setup properly you\u2019ll receive a",
