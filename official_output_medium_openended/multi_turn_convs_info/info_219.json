            "What are the options to consider when launching a currency on Verus, and how do these options enable customization and control over the currency's features and behavior?",
            "When launching a currency on Verus, you have various options to choose from, which enable customization and control over the currency's features and behavior. These options can be combined to create a currency that suits your specific needs.\n\n**Namespace and VerusID:**\nTo launch a currency, you need a namespace, which is a VerusID. This namespace serves as the name of the currency, and can have subIDs, such as product.MyBrand@ or user.MyBrand@. Registering a VerusID costs between 20 and 100 VRSC, and launching a currency costs 200 VRSC, both paid in the chain's native coin to the worldwide miners and stakers.\n\n**Currency Options:**\nYou can choose from various options to define your currency, which can be combined by adding their corresponding numbers together in the currency definition. These options include:\n\n1. **Reserves and Convertibility:** With option 1, your currency can have reserves and be convertible to and from those reserves. You can have one currency as its reserve or multiple currencies, up to 10, creating a \"Basket currency\". This option allows for centralized or decentralized launching.\n2. **Controlled SubIDs:** Option 2 restricts the creation of subIDs to only the controlling VerusID, which is the namespace of the currency (the rootID).\n3. **Referrals and Discounts:** By choosing option 8, you enable referrals and discounts for subID creation.\n\n**Customization and Control:**\nBy combining these options, you can create a currency that suits your specific needs. For example, you might want a currency with reserves and convertibility, but only allow the controlling VerusID to create subIDs. You can achieve this by adding options 1 and 2 together in the currency definition.\n\nThese options provide a high degree of customization and control over the features and behavior of your currency, allowing you to create a tailored solution for your brand, community, business, or organization.",
            "and ushers in a new era for brands, communities, businesses, entrepreneurs and organizations to create value in a better and more secure way than ever before.\nThe next chapter explains the options to choose from when launching currencies.\nOptions to Launch Currencies\nFor ease of explaining, all PBaaS-chain launch options are omitted. Good to know \u2014 with Verus anyone can also launch fully interoperable, independent and customizable blockchains with all the same L1 features as the Verus blockchain. The focus of this article is on launching currencies only, on Verus or any other PBaaS-chain.\nTo launch a currency on Verus (and any other PBaaS-chain) a namespace is needed. That namespace is a VerusID. The namespace is the name of the currency (e.g. MyBrand@). That namespace can also have subIDs (e.g. product.MyBrand@, user.MyBrand@, more on this later).\nOn Verus a VerusID registration costs between 20 and 100 VRSC, and the launch of a currency costs 200 VRSC. These costs are always paid in the chain\u2019s native coin (to the worldwide miners and stakers). On other PBaaS-chains these costs can differ since the chain launcher can define its own costs for VerusID registrations and currency launches.\nTo define a currency, choose options. Then combine these options to whatever the currency needs to be. Just add the numbers together in the currency definition. The currency options are listed below.\noptions:1 \u2014 The currency has reserves, and can be converted to and from the reserves (option 32 needs to be added). Can have one currency as its reserves, or multiple with up to 10 currencies. Let\u2019s call it a \u201cBasket currency\u201d \u2014 a currency with a basket of reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized.\noptions:2 \u2014 Only the controlling VerusID (the namespace of the currency, the rootID) can create subIDs.\noptions:8 \u2014 Referrals and discounts are enabled for subID cr",
