            "What is the Verus block reward halving, and how does it impact the Verus network, miners, and stakers? Additionally, what is the Fee Pool feature, and how does it benefit miners and stakers?",
            "The Verus block reward halving is a planned event that occurs every two years, where the block reward for miners and stakers is halved. This is part of Verus' predictable and transparent monetary policy, which was set in place at its inception. The block reward is the amount of Verus coins (VRSC) that miners and stakers receive as a reward for securing the network and validating transactions.\n\nThe halving event reduces the number of coins coming into circulation, which can have an impact on the Verus economy. However, Verus has implemented a feature called the Fee Pool to offset the reduction in block rewards. The Fee Pool is a mechanism that allows miners and stakers to earn additional rewards in the form of fees generated from various activities on the Verus network.\n\nWith the upcoming PBaaS-mainnet upgrade, the Fee Pool will become even more significant. PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) is a feature that allows anyone to launch their own blockchains, tokens, and currencies on the Verus network. These activities will generate fees that will be distributed to miners and stakers through the Fee Pool. This means that even though the block reward is halved, miners and stakers can still earn higher rewards through the Fee Pool.\n\nIn summary, the Verus block reward halving is a planned event that reduces the block reward for miners and stakers, but the Fee Pool feature helps to offset this reduction by providing additional rewards through fees generated from activities on the Verus network.",
            "Title: Announcing Verus Block Reward Halving\u200a\u2014\u200aPredictable, Transparent Monetary Policy\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/announcing-verus-block-reward-halving-predictable-transparent-monetary-policy-eec42c18ca4\nContent:\n\nAnnouncing Verus Block Reward Halving \u2014 Predictable, Transparent Monetary Policy\nEvery two years the Verus block reward is halved. This is part of the predictable and transparent monetary policy, set in place by its inception in May 2018.\n\nHalving Event\nThe current block reward is 12 VRSC \u2014 which means that miners and stakers who win a block are rewarded 12 VRSC for their efforts of securing the network. This number will go down to 6 VRSC, drastically lowering the number of coins coming into circulation. See the complete coin emission schedule here.\n\u2b50 What: Block reward to 6 VRSC\n\u23f1\ufe0f When: Block height 2,329,920 ( ~ Saturday 17 Dec 2022) see countdown\nIntroducing the Fee Pool\nWith the PBaaS-mainnet upgrade coming closer, let\u2019s introduce one of its gaming-changing features that will reward miners and stakers with drastically higher block rewards.\nHigher block rewards for miners and stakers.\nWhen PBaaS is activated on mainnet, anyone can launch blockchains, tokens and currencies, and they can convert currencies through Verus\u2019 L1 DeFi protocol. All these activities cost fees that directly go to the miners and stakers of the worldwide network.\nSo even though a halving to 6 VRSC might seem bad for miners and stakers at first glance, a lot of good things are on the horizon.\n\ud83d\udc49 Be on the cutting edge of blockchain technology and try out the fully functional testnet and its Fee Pool economy\nDiscuss and explore all Verus has to offer on Discord\nFollow on Twitter\nGo to verus.io",
