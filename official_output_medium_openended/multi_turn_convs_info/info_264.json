            "What is the concept of \"Community Contributed Value\" and how does it relate to local communities and the use of currency?",
            "The concept of \"Community Contributed Value\" refers to the value that a local community creates and contributes to a currency through its aggregate use and holdings. This value is a result of the community's demand for a prevailing currency, such as the United States Dollar, and is a significant factor in determining the currency's overall value.\n\nIn the case of a fiat currency like the US Dollar, its value comes from various factors, including its use in the domestic economy, as the global reserve currency, as the petrodollar, and as a store of value. When we zoom in on a local community, we can see that the community is providing a small fraction of value to the overall value of the USD through its aggregate use and holdings.\n\nHowever, currently, at the local level, communities have zero control over their own Community Contributed Value, and they do not experience much, if any, local benefit from it. The aggregate of all Community Contributed Value, worldwide, is centralized in the hands of a few institutions and governments.\n\nThe concept of Community Contributed Value is important because it highlights the potential for local communities to take control of their own economic value and create a more decentralized and community-driven economy. New technical tools and technologies, such as blockchain and cryptocurrency, may allow us to quantify and harness this value more effectively, enabling local communities to benefit more directly from their own economic activity.",

Rolling out a Community Currency for broad use would still require some additional work on user-facing apps.\nThe Problem\nLike any other good, money is ruled by the laws of supply and demand. A currency in high use requires a constant float of supply to be circulating through its system. In the case of a fiat currency, the demand for holders to hold the currency gives it its value. In other words, as users of a currency, we collectively give value to that currency by our use. For something like the United States Dollar, its value comes from use in its domestic economy, as the global reserve currency, as the petrodollar, as the primary numeraire in financial markets, as the base currency for most foreign and corporate debt, as a predominant store of value, etc. etc. If we live in the United States and we zoom in, looking at our own local community, we can see that we are providing some small fraction of value to the overall value of the USD through our community\u2019s aggregate use and holdings. However small that might be in relation to the global forces of supply and demand, it might still be a relatively large amount of value when considered from the community\u2019s point of view. Little work has been done in quantifying this actual value provided by a community through its demand for a prevailing currency, but new technical tools might allow us to see this more clearly through actual experience. That\u2019s what this sample case study is about \u2014 let\u2019s call this value created by a community, \u201cCommunity Contributed Value\u201d.\nObserving this in the world today, the first thing we see is that, at the local level, we have zero control of our own Community Contributed Value, nor do we experience much, if any, local benefit from it.
