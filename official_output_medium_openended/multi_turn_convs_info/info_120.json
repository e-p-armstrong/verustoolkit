            "What are the general steps involved in defining and launching a currency on a blockchain using Verus, and what are some of the options and specifications available when launching a currency?",
            "Defining and launching a currency on a blockchain using Verus involves several steps. First, you need to fund the VerusID with a sufficient amount of VRSCTEST to launch the currency. Then, you can define the currency using the `definecurrency` command, specifying options such as the name of the currency, the type of currency (e.g., simple token, fractional reserve currency, or multi-reserve basket), and the proof protocol.\n\nIn the example given, the currency definition is simple, with only two options specified: `options`: 32, which indicates that the currency is just a token, and `proofprotocol`: 2, which means that the controller of the VerusID where the currency is launched from can mint and burn tokens at will.\n\nAfter defining the currency, a second signer needs to sign off on the currency definition and launch the currency. This involves signing a HEX code using the `signrawtransaction` command and then submitting the transaction to the chain using the `sendrawtransaction` command. Once this is done, it takes around 15 blocks for the currency to be officially launched on the network.\n\nSome of the options and specifications available when launching a currency on Verus include:\n\n* Defining the currency as a simple token, fractional reserve currency, or multi-reserve basket\n* Specifying the start and end blocks for the currency\n* Setting minimum and maximum preconversions\n* Defining initial contributions and initial supply\n* Offering pre-launch discounts and carveouts\n* And much more\n\nIt's worth noting that the costs associated with launching a currency on Verus go to the miners and stakers of the blockchain. Additionally, the Verus community is available to help with any questions or issues that may arise during the process.",

Good to know: these costs are going to the miners and stakers of the blockchain.\nWith a few simple commands, we will:\nDefine the currency\nHave it signed by a second signature\nLaunch the currency\nBefore starting we must fund VGG@ with 200+ VRSCTEST to launch the currency. The chain definition is as follows:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"VGG\", \n \"options\":32, \n \"proofprotocol\":2\n}'\nIt\u2019s a simple chain definition, with only \u201coptions\u201d:32 (= the currency is just a token), and \u201cproofprotocol\u201d:2 (= the controller of the VerusID where the currency is launched from can mint and burn tokens at will).\nThese are some options and specifications that are possible when launching a currency: as a simple token, as fractional reserve currency or multi-reserve basket, start & end block, min. & max. preconversions, initial contributions, pre-launch discount & carveout, initial supply and much more.\n\u2b50 To learn more about the many different launch options when defining a currency on Verus, go here \ud83d\udd17 We encourage anyone to start testing the protocol to get ahead of the game. The community is happy to help on Discord \ud83d\udd17\nApproving and launching the currency\nNow, the second signer needs to come in and sign off on the currency definition, and launch the currency.\nThe command from before gives out a HEX. The second signer needs to sign this HEX as follows:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST signrawtransaction \"hex\"\nThis gives out another HEX. We use it to submit the transaction to the chain, which in turn launches the currency.\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction \"hex\"\nAfter doing the command above, it takes around 15 blocks before the currency is officially launched on the network.\nNext step is the minting and burning of toke",
