            "What are some ways that Verus helps protect users from losing access to their funds, and how can users utilize VerusIDs and authorities to secure their assets?",
            "Verus provides several features that help users protect their assets from theft and loss. Two common problems with private keys are having them stolen and losing them. Verus offers solutions to both of these issues.\n\n**Protection Against Theft:**\nTo protect against theft, Verus recommends assigning revocation and recovery authorities to an address that can be securely stored, such as a paper wallet. This means that even if a user's primary ID is compromised, the revocation and recovery authorities can be used to regain control of the funds. Additionally, users can lock their ID on the network and set a time period before it unlocks. If a request to unlock the ID appears on the blockchain, the user can revoke the primary authority and recover it to a different ID, effectively preventing theft.\n\n**Protection Against Loss:**\nIn the event that a user loses their revocation and recovery IDs, Verus provides a solution to recover their funds. The user can request an unlock on the ID that holds their funds, and while waiting for the unlock, create two new IDs. Once the coins unlock, the user can send them to one of the new IDs and assign revocation and recovery for that ID to the other new ID. This way, the user can regain access to their funds and ensure they are protected again.\n\n**UI and Capability:**\nWhile Verus provides these features, users may not want to think about complex concepts like authorities. To address this, the Verus community is working on user interface (UI) solutions that will make it easier for users to utilize authorities and protect their assets.\n\n**Additional Capabilities:**\nVerus is also working on additional fundamental work at the protocol level. For example, users can assign the three authorities to multiple IDs, which can help with scenarios such as estate planning. These features enable more complex and secure use cases, and users can expect to see more information on these topics in the future.",
            "ig problems with private keys are 1) having them stolen and 2) losing them. Verus helps with both.\nTo Protect Against Theft\nAssign revocation and recovery authorities to an address that you can protect. For example, you might assign them to an address you created with a paper wallet. It won\u2019t be compromised electronically because it\u2019ll never have been on the network.\nLock the ID that\u2019s on the network and set a time period before it unlocks. If a request to unlock that ID appears on the blockchain, revoke the primary authority and recover it to a different ID.\nTo Protect Against Losing an ID\nAnd if you happen to lose the paper on which you wrote down your revocation and recovery ID, Verus can help with that too:\nFirst, request an unlock on the ID that holds your funds (the one that your revocation and recovery ID was protecting).\nWhile you\u2019re waiting for the unlock, create two additional IDs. (Say Bobby@ and Allison@.)\nWhen the coins unlock, send them to one of the new IDs (e.g., Bobby@). Then assign revocation and recovery for that ID to the other ID (e.g., assigned revocation and recovery for Bobby@ to Allison@). Your funds are usable and protected again.\nUI Versus Capability\nUsers may not want to think about concepts like \u2018authorities.\u2019 A user interface (UI), can provide instructions and clearly labeled controls that make authorities easy to use. The Verus community is already working on UI solutions. Maybe you should join us.\nThere\u2019s More\nTogether, VerusIDs and the three authorities improve and enable basic scenarios. But Verus is doing additional fundamental work at the protocol level. For example, you can assigned the three authorities to multiple IDs (e.g., five different IDs, or seven). Doing so can help with scenarios such as estate planning. Keep an eye out for articles on this and other scenarios.\n**\n\u00b7 There\u2019s a Verus channel on Medium with a lot more inform",
