            "What is Verus's Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and how does it enable users to create their own customizable blockchains?",
            "Verus's Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) is a feature that allows anyone to create their own independent and customizable blockchain. To create a chain, one needs to have a VerusID name for the chain. This means that users can launch their own blockchains with ease, and each blockchain in the ecosystem is independent and customizable.\n\nOne of the key benefits of PBaaS is that chains can be nested to any level, allowing for an unlimited number of new chains to be spawned from a single chain. For example, a chain called \"NewChain\" can be launched on the main Verus blockchain, and then NewChain can be used to launch an unlimited number of new chains, each using identities on NewChain.\n\nNewly created chains inherit the 50/50% PoW/PoS consensus mechanism, which may be customizable in the future. Additionally, a newly created chain can be mined by the miners of VerusCoin, thanks to a feature called Merge-Mining. This means that a creator of a chain doesn't have to worry about creating their own mining infrastructure, as they can tap into the existing mining power of VerusCoin.\n\nPBaaS chains form the basis for a practically unlimited scalability of the Verus system. This is because popular currencies and tokens can exist and be interchangeable on many Verus blockchains, so they won't be restricted or limited by the capacities of a single blockchain.\n\nWhen creating a chain, the creator has a range of options to customize the chain's characteristics. For example, they can specify coin supply, coin emission with up to three eras, and define the price for identities. They can also set up Kickstarter-like minimums to activate the chain, or automatically refund if the minimums are not met. Other options include dynamic coin launch pricing based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carve outs, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations. All of these options can be specified using easy-to-understand commands and parameters, without requiring any programming knowledge.",
            "Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS): Launch Your Own Blockchain\nVerus sees a future where anyone can create their own blockchain in an easy fashion. Every blockchain in the ecosystem is independent and customizable. To create a chain one needs to have the VerusID name of the chain.\nChains can be nested to any level, so that a chain, say \u201cNewChain\u201d, that is launched with a VerusID on the main Verus blockchain, can be used to spawn an unlimited amount of new chains, each of these using identities on NewChain, which can be acquired at any cost as selected by the creator of NewChain.\nNew chains inherit the 50/50% PoW/PoS consensus mechanism. This percentage might be customizable in the future.\nA newly created chain can be mined by the miners of VerusCoin. A miner in the VerusCoin ecosystem can mine up to 22 different PBaaS-chains without losing any of the original hash power. This is called Merge-Mining and means that a creator of the chain doesn\u2019t have to worry about creating their own mining infrastructure.\nPBaaS chains will form the basis for a practically unlimited scalability of the Verus system. Popular currencies and tokens can exist and be interchangeable on many Verus blockchains, so that they won\u2019t be restricted or limited by the capacities of a single blockchain.\nA chain can have certain characteristics like launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund. Other options include dynamic coin launch pricing based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carve outs, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations. Additionally the creator can specify coin supply, coin emission with up to three era\u2019s and define the price for identities. All specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary.Multi-Reserve Currencies: DeFi Reimagined\nVerus is curren",
