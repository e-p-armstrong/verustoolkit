            "What are the purposes of the \"conversions\" and \"minpreconversion\" parameters when launching a simple token currency using Verus, and how do they interact with each other to facilitate the preconversion process?",
            "When launching a simple token currency using Verus, the \"conversions\" and \"minpreconversion\" parameters play crucial roles in facilitating the preconversion process.\n\nThe \"conversions\" parameter is used to set the preconversion price for the currency. It determines how many units of the new currency a user will receive in exchange for a certain amount of Verus (VRSC) during the preconversion time frame. For example, if \"conversions\" is set to [0.1], then for every VRSC preconverted, the user will receive 10 units of the new currency.\n\nThe \"minpreconversion\" parameter, on the other hand, is used to set a minimum amount of preconversions required for the currency to launch. If the minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and all users who preconverted will have their funds returned, minus transaction and conversion fees.\n\nThese two parameters interact with each other to create a funding mechanism for the rootID. During the preconversion time frame, users can preconvert their VRSC to the new currency at the specified preconversion price. If the minimum preconversion amount is met, the currency will launch, and users will receive their new currency. If the minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and users will have their funds returned.\n\nIt's important to note that there is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting, which should be taken into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.\n\nIn summary, the \"conversions\" parameter sets the preconversion price, while the \"minpreconversion\" parameter sets the minimum amount of preconversions required for the currency to launch. These two parameters work together to facilitate the preconversion process and create a funding mechanism for the rootID.",
            "\u201cconversions\u201d\nUse this parameter when launching a simple token currency. Together with \"currencies\", it can be used as a funding mechanism for the rootID. It\u2019s for the preconversion price. So when doing \"conversions\":[0.1], it means that for every VRSC the preconverter receives 10 CURRENCY after launch. The converted VRSC goes into the rootID.\nPeople can preconvert to this currency within the preconversion time frame. Define a \"startblock\", or let the default and minimum time frame play out, which is 20 blocks.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"CoolBrand\",\n \"options\":32,\n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\n \"conversions\":[0.1],\n \"minpreconversion\":[1000]\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This simple token currency is called CoolBrand. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 1000 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 10.000 CoolBrand. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds back.\n\u201cminpreconversion\u201d\nUse this parameter to set a minimum amount of preconversions. The minimum amount of preconversions needs to be met or the currency will not launch and everyone gets their conversions returned, minus the transaction and conversion fees. It works both with basket currencies and simple token currencies.\nThere is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting. Take this into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"CompanyX\",\n \"options\":32,\n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\n \"conversions\":[2],\n \"minpreconversion\":[500]\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This simple token currency is called CompanyX. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 250 CompanyX. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their fun",
