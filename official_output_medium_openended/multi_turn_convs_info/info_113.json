            "What is Verus's Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) technology, and how does it address challenges such as MEV, scalability, and cross-chain/network interoperability in Ethereum and other networks?",
            "Verus's Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) technology is a decentralized platform that enables the creation and launch of scalable and interoperable currencies and tokens. This technology addresses several challenges present in Ethereum and other networks, including Miner Extractable Value (MEV), scalability, and cross-chain/network interoperability.\n\nOne of the key features of Verus's PBaaS technology is its ability to launch ERC-20 tokens and currencies in a decentralized manner. This is made possible through the Verus Interchain Protocol (VIP), a decentralized bridging technology that allows creators to export currencies and tokens from Verus to Ethereum as ERC-20s without requiring Solidity developers or actual programming. This not only saves costs but also enables the use of the most feature-rich decentralized crypto protocol to date.\n\nFurthermore, currencies and tokens on the Verus protocol can be created to be mapped 1:1 with any ERC-20 token, making it possible to transfer value in ways that were previously not possible. All currencies and tokens on both the Verus and Ethereum networks can be used with Verus DeFi, which is part of the L1 consensus protocol. This means that all AMM conversions cannot be front-run, providing a secure and reliable way to perform decentralized finance operations.\n\nOverall, Verus's PBaaS technology provides a scalable, decentralized, and interoperable platform for launching and managing currencies and tokens, addressing some of the major challenges present in Ethereum and other networks.",

The world\u2019s most influential crypto & blockchain experience of the year. Here tens of thousands of crypto enthusiasts come together to discover the latest industry-leading developments.Verus Addresses Ethereum Network Challenges\nThe Verus protocol addresses challenges that are seen in Ethereum and other networks. Challenges such as MEV (Miner Extractable Value), scalability and cross-chain/network interoperability.\nWith the release of the new Verus testnet (March 6, 2022, see extensive release notes) and the planned mainnet launch before the start of Consensus 2022, Verus can be used as, among many other things, a launch platform for ERC-20 tokens and currencies.\nThrough the Verus Interchain Protocol (VIP, decentralized bridging technology) creators can use the Verus protocol to create currencies and tokens and immediately export them to Ethereum as ERC-20s without needing any Solidity developers or actual programming. Saving costs and having the ability to use the most feature-rich decentralized crypto protocol to date. Currencies and tokens on the Verus protocol can also be created to be mapped 1:1 with any ERC-20 token, making never seen before value transfers possible.\nAll currencies and tokens on the Verus and Ethereum networks can be used with Verus DeFi. Verus DeFi is part of the L1 consensus protocol, which means that all AMM conversions can not be fron",
