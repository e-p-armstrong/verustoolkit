            "How does Verus handle identity issuance, including fractional, token, and native identities, and what features are supported for identity registration, pricing, and gateway registration?",
            "Verus provides a robust identity issuance system that supports various types of identities, including fractional, token, and native identities. When a new identity is issued, the fees are paid to the controlling ID of the currency, rather than being burned. This system also supports advanced features such as \"requires permission\" and \"referral required\" issuance, where the identity registration transaction must be counter-signed by either the ID of the issuing currency or a valid referrer.\n\nIn terms of pricing, Verus allows for separate pricing, referral namespaces, and referral levels for all identity namespaces. This means that different pricing structures can be applied to different identity namespaces, and referral rewards can be set up for specific namespaces. Additionally, the pricing of sub-IDs for a fractional currency can be denominated in the currency itself or in any of its reserves, such as USD, VRSC, or EUR. This enables compatibility with ID-based rights licensing or royalty streams priced in any currency.\n\nVerus also supports gateway registration for centralized or decentralized non-name controller gateways, such as the ETH bridge. This allows for the issuance of identities priced in a specific currency, such as USD, and paid in the gateway's native currency. Furthermore, Verus enables the creation of \"mapped currencies\" using the gateway-registered IDs, such as BAT.vETH mapped to Ethereum BAT. This feature allows gateways to provide services that would be harder for them to develop from scratch, making it easier for them to integrate with Verus.",
            ", whether fractional, token, or even native, issue identities and the fees are paid to the controlling ID of the currency, not burned.\nNew \u201crequires permission\u201d and \u201creferral required\u201d issuance is supported. If this is specified as an option in an ID issuing currency definition, which may still be a decentralized issuer, the identity registration transaction must be counter-signed by either the ID of the issuing currency (\u201crequires permission\u201d) or a valid referrer (\u201creferral required\u201d) which either is the issuing currency ID or an unrevoked ID with the same parent as the new identity. The identity registration command and API will enforce this and create transactions that must be signed in this manner.\nSeparate pricing, referral namespaces, and referral levels for all identity namespaces are supported (ie. only *.fanclub@ can refer for name.fanclub@).\nPricing of sub-IDs for a fractional currency can be either in the currency itself or denominated in any of its reserves (eg. USD, VRSC, EUR, etc.) to enable compatibility with ID-based rights licensing or royalty streams priced in any currency.\nGateway registration for centralized or decentralized non-name controller gateways (the ETH bridge, for example) that allow issuance of, for example, mike.veth@, priced in USD, and paid in Bridge.VETH.\nCreation of \u201cmapped currencies\u201d using the gateway registered IDs, such as BAT.vETH mapped to Ethereum BAT, for example. Normal sub-IDs cannot create currencies, but this is enabled for gateways that are not name controllers to provide them with services that would be harder for them to write than use from Verus.",
