            "What are some ways in which a Community Currency (CommCurr) can be enhanced, and how can SubIDs contribute to creating a digital goods economy that benefits the currency?",
            "A Community Currency (CommCurr) can be enhanced in several ways, including the ability to stagger escrows, which allows community members to unlock a certain percentage of their funds at a time. This feature can provide more flexibility and control over the currency. However, it's essential to consider the potential risks, such as building in capital cost risk for the community if a lock is made irrevocable.\n\nOne of the most innovative aspects of a Community Currency is the ability to create a real digital goods economy around it. This can be achieved through the use of SubIDs, which are multi-use friendly name \"identities\" that community members can register by paying a set amount of CommCurr. This process increases the value of CommCurr because the amounts paid for the \"identities\" are burned, thus increasing the value of the currency for all holders.\n\nCommunity members may register SubIDs for various reasons, such as:\n\n* To signal support for the community\n* To have a recognizable or branded community-oriented name to receive funds\n* To create a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) or public profile attached to the name\n* To use as a ticket for an event or a discount code for purchases, or a membership in a club\n* To attach to a physical item, like a community landmark, where it can represent a public profile or description, fundraiser, message board, etc.\n\nThese digital goods can create a real demand for the currency, and the possibilities are virtually unlimited. The use of SubIDs can enhance the value and utility of the Community Currency, making it a more robust and sustainable ecosystem.",
            " CommCurr. They can choose to stagger escrows, making, say, 10% freely spendable now, and then unlocking 10% a year after that. One aspect to consider is that, if a lock is made irrevocable, it will build in capital cost risk for a community. Ie. if the experiment is a failure and there\u2019s no adoption, they wouldn\u2019t have access to their original capital until the unlock period passes.\nWait, There\u2019s More \u2014 Enhancing the Community Currency through New Capabilities for a Digital Goods Economy that Directly and Tangibly Benefits the Currency\nPossibly the most forward-thinking element of a Community Currency is the ability to build a real digital goods economy around it. The Verus protocols make this possible through the issuance of what are called SubIDs. SubIDs are multi-use friendly name \u201cidentities\u201d. Community members can register these names by paying a set amount of CommCurr, for example, 10 CommCurr per registration. This increases the value of CommCurr because any amounts paid for the \u201cidentities\u201d are burned, thus increasing the value of the currency for all holders thereof (including the original issuer).\nCommunity members might seek to register identities for many reasons:\nto signal support for the community\nto have a recognizable or branded community-oriented name to receive funds, eg. \u201cmember.CommCurr@\u201d\nto create a NFT or public profile attached to the name (\u201cidentities\u201d are capable of being expressed as nfts, artwork, public profiles, etc.)\nto be a ticket for an event or a discount code for purchases, or a membership in a club\nTo be attached to a physical item, like a community landmark, where it can represent a public profile or description, fundraiser, message board, etc.\nThese are just some of the virtually unlimited examples of digital goods that could be created, all of which would require CommCurr to acquire, this creating a real demand for the currency.\n",
