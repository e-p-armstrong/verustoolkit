            "The Verus foundation is offering two bounty programs, one for developing a competitive miner for VerusHash 2.0 on GPU hardware, and another for developing a competitive miner on FPGA hardware. Here are the requirements and rules for both bounty programs:\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* The developed miner implementation must be open-source and available to the community without being used in secret beforehand.\n* The miner implementation must beat the best CPU hash rate by at least 1.5x hash rate for a comparably priced CPU-to-device.\n* For GPU development, the target GPU must be a common, publicly available nVidia or AMD device.\n* For FPGA development, the hardware must be easily available and under $1250 per device.\n\n**Submission and Qualification:**\n\n* Submitted implementations must be complete, working, and in a form that can be easily tested by a representative of the Verus Coin Foundation.\n* The Verus Coin Foundation reserves the right to determine the eligibility of submitted implementations at its sole discretion.\n\n**Bounty Rewards:**\n\n* For a qualifying GPU software miner, the bounty reward is 50,000 VRSC.\n* For a qualifying FPGA development, the bounty reward is 100,000 VRSC.\n* Both bounty rewards will be provided as addresses holding time-locked VRSC, which will release uniformly over a period of approximately 1 year and 8.5 months.\n\n**Important Note:**\nThe bounty offerings are subject to change or renewal at the sole discretion of the Verus Coin Foundation.",
            " in the Komodo ecosystem, but if we missed out on your favorite, please reach out on Discord and let us know!\nTwo Related Bounty Offerings!\nIn conjunction with this release, the Verus foundation is offering two bounties, one for GPU and one for FPGA development. The bounty of each is for the first implementation of a competitive miner for VerusHash 2.0 for that particular hardware type with some stipulations:\nThe code must be made open source and available to the community without first being used in secret.\nTo qualify, the miner implementation must beat the best CPU hash rate by at least 1.5x hash rate for a comparably priced CPU-to-device.\nFor GPUs the target GPU individually performing the qualifying hash rate must be common (and available to the general public) nVidia or AMD devices. For FPGAs, the hardware performing the qualifying hash rate must be easily available and under $1250 per device.\nSubmitted and qualifying implementations must be completed, working, and in a form that can be easily tested by a representative of the Verus Coin Foundation. This bounty offer will automatically end 90 days after this release (prior to March 20, 2019) and may be renewed by the Verus Coin Foundation at its sole discretion. Entries submitted will also be determined eligible for a bounty at the sole discretion of the Verus Coin Foundation and its representatives.\nFor a qualifying GPU software miner, over and above any additional bounties earned by any qualifying developer, the bounty will be 50,000 VRSC. For a qualifying FPGA development, over and above any additional bounties earned by any qualifying developer, the bounty will be 100,000 VRSC. Both of these bounties will be provided as addresses holding time-locked VRSC, which will release uniformly over the next 1 year and ~8.5 months.\nGood luck developers!\nGet involved in Verus Coin and the Verus community\nWant to learn mo",
