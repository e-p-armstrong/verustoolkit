            "What are the present issues with existing cryptocurrency bridges, and how does the Verus-Ethereum Bridge address these problems?",
            "Existing cryptocurrency bridges have several issues that compromise their security and decentralization. Some of the key problems are:\n\n1. **Centralized custody**: Bridged assets are typically held by a single or a small number of addresses, creating a central authority that contradicts the decentralized nature of blockchain.\n2. **Modifiable smart contracts**: Smart contracts securing bridged assets can be modified by a singular or limited number of authorities, posing potential security risks.\n3. **Smart contract vulnerabilities**: Smart contracts may contain bugs or malicious code, making them susceptible to exploitation and undermining the safety of bridged assets.\n\nThese issues have led to numerous bridge hacks in the past and may continue to do so in the future.\n\nThe Verus-Ethereum Bridge, on the other hand, addresses these problems by ensuring that assets are never in anyone's custody. This is achieved through a cooperative process involving block producers, community notary witnesses, the Bridgekeeper software, and the Ethereum smart contract. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Notarizations**: Every 10 blocks, validators create digital receipts called \"notarizations\" for both Verus and Ethereum. These notarizations contain essential information, such as the stateroot, blockheight, blockhash, and gas price for Ethereum.\n2. **Consensus validation**: The notarizations are validated by the block producers (miners and stakers) and then mined into the Verus blockchain.\n3. **Cross-chain verification**: During cross-chain transactions, assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent hacks.\n\nBy using this decentralized and consensus-based approach, the Verus-Ethereum Bridge ensures that assets are never held by a single entity, and smart contracts are secured by the collective validation of the blockchain network. This design prevents the problems associated with existing cryptocurrency bridges, providing a more secure and decentralized solution for cross-chain transactions.",
            "ies from Verus to Ethereum as ERC-721 & ERC-1155.\nPresent Issues with Existing Cryptocurrency Bridges\nLet\u2019s first delve into the challenges associated with the prevailing cryptocurrency bridges in the industry.\nThe custody of bridged assets is typically maintained by a single or a small number of addresses, effectively creating a central authority for holding the funds, which contradicts the decentralized nature of blockchain.\nThe smart contracts that secure these bridged assets can be readily modified by a singular or limited number of authorities, thus presenting potential security issues.\nSmart contracts might contain bugs or malicious codes, making them susceptible to exploitation and undermining the safety of the bridged assets, especially if those assets are not accounted for by the block producers.\nThese problems have been demonstrated by numerous bridge hacks that have occurred and are likely to continue in the future. Verus does things, yet again, very different.\nWhy the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is Different\nThe Verus-Ethereum Bridge is different because the assets are never in anyone\u2019s custody. This is done through the seamless cooperation between the block producers, community notary witnesses, the Bridgekeeper software and the Ethereum smart contract. At each step during cross-chain transactions the assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent hacks.\nEvery 10 blocks validators create a notarization. They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum. The digital receipts, called \u201cnotarizations\u2019\u2019, contain, among other things: the \u201cstateroot\u201d (Merkle Mountain Range for Verus, Merkle Patricia Trie for Ethereum), the blockheight, blockhash and the gas price for Ethereum. The notarizations have to be agreed to by the block producers (miners and stakers) and are then mined into the Verus blockchain.\n\ud83d\udc49 Read more ",
