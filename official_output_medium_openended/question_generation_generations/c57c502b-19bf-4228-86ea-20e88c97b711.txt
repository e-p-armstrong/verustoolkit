    \ based on the given information, and *only* based on the given information. The\
    \ question will test comprehension of real information that would be worthy to\
    \ teach in order for people to understand more about the Verus protocol and community.\
    \ After the question, you will also write its answer.\n\nThe question should be\
    \ an open-ended one that brings together multiple concepts from the provided information,\
    \ and requires thought, length, and detail to answer fully. Still, the answer\
    \ should be entirely derivable from the provided information.\n\nA good rule of\
    \ thumb is to essentially ask a question that the provided information would be\
    \ a decent answer to.\n\nThe question must ask about information that a user of\
    \ Verus might ask about. Think questions about the nature of important concepts,\
    \ lists of key features, primary benefits, pros and cons, contrasts with other\
    \ platforms, summaries...\n\n**Useful general background information that comes\
    \ up a lot:**\n\n* Any string resembling \"Name@\" is likely a VerusID, which\
    \ is essentially a crypto-address.\n* Verus has been launched for a number of\
    \ years by this point, and the mainnet and testnet are both fully functional.\
    \ Anything alluding to \"upcoming launches\" of features could likely be out of\
    \ date. So be ambiguous.\n* PoP, in the context of Verus, usually refers to \"\
    Proof of Power,\" which is a hybrid consensus algorithm that uses a statistical\
    \ function that combines Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate\
    \ each block.\n* Many verus commands are done by running `./verus` and then providing\
    \ the input on a normal command line. This executable is in the verus project.\n\
    * `./verusd` starts the Verus daemon.\n* Verus is an open-source, fairly launched,\
    \ decentralized blockchain protocol with proof-of-work and proof-of-stake (proof\
    \ of power, taken together) as its consensus mechanism. It offers rent-free blockchain\
    \ tools for creators and organizations to build products, systems, and services.\n\
    * Verus is a multichain protocol with strong focus on scalability, security and\
    \ decentralization. It can scale to world demand, is proven 51% hash attack resistant\
    \ and is community built - all coins in circulation are fairly mined and staked.\n\
    * Verus is much more than any single ordinary blockchain; more of an entire ecosystem\
    \ of interconnected blockchains that all operate decentralized and at the protocol\
    \ level, and which, together, can scale to global levels of demand.\n* Protocol-level\
    \ self-sovereign digital identities and namespaces (VerusID) are at the center\
    \ of the Verus multichain protocol.\n\n**You Must:**\n\n* Create a very detailed,\
    \ broad educational question based on the snippet of a website.\n* Give it a fitting\
    \ answer.\n* Do not mention the website, or the text, or any other reference.\
    \ Just ask about the facts or information.\n* The goal is not to touch on all\
    \ of the information (and in so doing create a \"clunky\" question) but to create\
    \ an open-ended query that requires thought and understanding of at least a few\
    \ different parts of the information to solve.\n* Ensure a logical sequence of\
    \ questions that build on each other.\n* Keep in mind that the provided information\
    \ may have been written before certain features released. Verus launched some\
    \ years ago, has an active community, and has delivered on its initial technological\
    \ vision. Some things are still in development though, so you should be ambiguous\
    \ with dates.\n* Use markdown formatting (such as code blocks and snippets) in\
    \ your questions if applicable.\n* Focus on important information that is relevant\
    \ to understanding Verus. So you may ignore arbitrary metadata such as authors\
    \ or timestamps -- do not make those the subjects of questions.\n* Keep in mind\
    \ that the provided text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around this.\n* Include\
    \ the information from the given paragraph alongside a simpler explanation of\
    \ some underlying concepts, if possible.\n* If the given information mentions\
    \ how a feature of Verus is different from many of its competitors, EMPHASIZE\
    \ THAT.\n* Signpost the key things you will discuss in the answer near the start\
    \ of the answer -- your answers should have good structure to them.\n* Explain\
    \ what common crypto terms mean, if present.\n* Explanations in the provided information\
    \ may be vague. Your answers should be easy to understand.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* Documents\
    \ may be out of date, and technology described as being in development has likely\

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    Explain and suggest a solution to the errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nPlease show me how to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to\
    \ a new token before that token launches, how to define a new token called \"\
    mycoin\", and how to define a PBaaS chain, using the command line?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    To accomplish this you will need to use Verus on the command line with different\
    \ inputs. In order, here's how to park the conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token\
    \ before it launches, and how to defien a PBaaS chain. \n\n\n**Parking Conversion\
    \ of VRSCTEST:**\nTo park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before a new\
    \ token launches, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. For example, let's say\
    \ you are parking conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token called `gold` before it\
    \ launches. Here's the format you need to use:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST\
    \ sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"\
    preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis will effectively park your conversion\
    \ until the GOLD token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted\
    \ amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount\
    \ returned.\n\n**Create New Token Called `mycoin`**\nIn order to create a new\
    \ token called `mycoin` using the command line, you must run a command to define\
    \ the currency's properties. Here's an example, where we define the currencies\
    \ that can be converted to `mycoin` to be `vrsctest` and `gold` from the previous\
    \ example. The command you would use is:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency\
    \ '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"\
    vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\"\
    :20000'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\". Some important\
    \ notes about this configuration:\n\n1. `proofprotocol` being set to 2 means that\
    \ it's set to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID can\
    \ mint new coins.\n2. `options` is a configurable integer, in this case set to\
    \ 33.\n3. `currencies` lists which tokens can be converted to mycoin.\n4. `\"\
    minpreconversion\": [10000,5.1298]` defines the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and\
    \ GOLD needed to convert to mycoin, respectively.\n5. `initialsupply` sets the\
    \ initial supply of mycoin to 20,000 units.\n\n**Defining a PBaaS Blockchain:**\n\
    You can define a PBaaS blockchain using a single command line command with Verus.\
    \ You need to pass two JSON objects, one for the PBaaS blockchain, and another\
    \ for the overridable defaults of the bridge. Here's an example of how to define\
    \ a PBaaS blockchain named `PBaaSChain`:\n\n```shell\n./verus -chain=vrsctest\
    \ definecurrency '{\"name\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"options\":264,\"currencies\":[\"\
    VRSCTEST\"],\"conversions\":[1],\"eras\":[{\"reward\":1200000000,\"decay\":0,\"\
    halving\":0,\"eraend\":0}],\"notaries\":[\"Notary1@\",\"Notary2@\",\"Notary3@\"\
    ],\"minnotariesconfirm\":2,\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.111:10000\"\
    ,\"nodeidentity\":\"Node1@\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.112:10000\",\"\
    nodeidentity\":\"Node2@\"}],\"gatewayconvertername\":\"Bridge\",\"gatewayconverterissuance\"\
    :1000000}' '{\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\",\"PBaaSChain\",\"USD\"],\"initialcontributions\"\
    :[371747.20398827,0,1000000],\"initialsupply\":3000000}'\n```\n\nNote the following\
    \ important information used when defining the PBaaS blockchain:\n\n1. The \"\
    name\" field defines the name of the chain.\n2. The \"options\" property is an\
    \ integer, in this case it's set to 264.\n2. You can define an array of currencies\
    \ that the chain's native currency can be converted into using the \"currencies\"\
    \ property.\n3. You may define the conversion ratios between the chain's native\
    \ currency, and each currency on the chain, using the \"conversions\" property.\n\
    4. The \"eras\" property defines the block reward, reward decay, halving, and\
    \ end of each \"era\" in the chain's lifecycle\n5. \"notaries\" is a list of the\
    \ VerusIDs that will serve as notaries on the chain.\n6. \"minnotariesconfirm\"\
    \ is an integer for the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block.\n\
    7. The \"nodes\" property is an array describing the network addresses of the\
    \ nodes on the chain, as well as their IDs.\n\nNote that the bridge definition\
    \ default overrides are a separate string from the currency definition properties.\
    \ The bridge can be used to move funds on and off the PBaaS chain. The bridge's\
    \ JSON object has some of its own properties:\n1. `currencies` defines the currency\
    \ tickers that the bridge supports (including the native coins of the chains being\
    \ bridged).\n2. `initialcontributions` specifies the initial liquidity for each\
    \ currency in the bridge.\n3. `initialsupply` gives the initial supply for the\
    \ bridge's native token."

    What is Stake Guard, and how do I enable it in Verus to catch cheaters and earn
    cheat rewards?


    **ANSWER:**

    Stake Guard is a functionality in Verus that allows miners and stakers to detect
    and counter cheating on the network. When a cheater attempts to fork the blockchain,
    they create an identifiable fork that can be detected by other nodes on the network.
    Stake Guard enables honest miners and stakers to "catch" these cheaters by spending
    the single "legitimate" coinbase from the block height at which they cheated,
    sending it to a designated zs-address before the cheater can spend it.


    Enabling Stake Guard is a simple process that involves generating a new Sapling-type
    zs-address and starting the Verus daemon with the `-cheatcatcher` parameter set
    to that address. Here are the step-by-step instructions for both CLI and GUI wallets:


    **For CLI Wallet:**


    1. Generate a new Sapling-type zs-address using the command `./verus-cli/verus
    z_getnewaddress sapling`. This will echo back your new zs-address.

    2. Start your Verus daemon with the parameter `-cheatcatcher=zsaddr`, where "zsaddr"
    is your new zs-address. For example, to start the daemon staking and with Stake
    Guard enabled, you would run `./verus-cli/verusd -mint -cheatcatcher=zsaddr`.


    **For GUI Wallet:**


    1. Generate a new Sapling-type zs-address from the Send section by choosing "Private
    Address (Sapling)" from the Get New Address dropdown.

    2. Set the `-cheatcatcher` parameter to the generated zs-address in the GUI wallet
    settings.


    By enabling Stake Guard, you not only help to maintain the integrity of the Verus
    network but also earn a cheat reward when you detect a cheating attempt. Additionally,
    Stake Guard serves as a reminder to ensure that you are not inadvertently cheating
    by staking on the same wallet across multiple computers, which can result in lost
    staked rewards.'
