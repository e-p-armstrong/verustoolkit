- content: 'You are checking whether a provided question and answer make sense if
    asked by themselves, with no additional information. You need to check for vague
    wording that a reader cannot interpret correctly, and questions that lack key
    context and would not be possibly answerable even if asked of someone with complete,
    masterful knowledge of the general subject matter of the question.


    In particular, you are checking for references to a "text" that is not provided,
    and you''re also hunting for anchor links to other information on the same document
    (such as)[#!/this/kind/of/thing.md], which will be broken links if they appear
    in the question or answer. Links that are URLs (external links) are fine, however.


    Evaluate the provided question-answer pair step-by-step. Following this, at the
    very end of your response, your "final judgment" or "final answer", you will write
    "PASS" or "FAIL" or "REWORD". A test should "PASS" if it "makes sense" and does
    not lack key context; it is a "FAIL" if it lacks key context, AND the question
    is not specific or clear. If it lacks context but the question is specific, pointed,
    and grounded, then it needs to be reworded to have the context-needing terms (i.e.,
    vague reference to "the text") removed. If it has no problems, it passes.


    The question may be part of a sequence of questions, so REFERENCES TO PREVIOUS
    STEPS ARE OK. It''s references to a text, or relative links, that are problems
    in need of fixing.


    If you decide to reword the question and answer, you MUST WRITE THE REWORDED QUESTION
    BELOW YOUR JUDGEMENT after the heading ### Question Rewording:


    I want you to especially check for vague references to "the text", "passage",
    and "excerpt". The question and answer should not mention unspecified, vague texts
    or excerpts.


    Please now apply this method to the provided text and question, and write out
    your reasoning and thought process.


    The goal with rewording is to have both the question and answer express a topic,
    fact, idea, or opinion in a GENERAL way that is NOT TIED TO ANY SPECIFIC CONTEXT
    which the reader does not have.

    What is the purpose of the steps outlined in the text, and what problem do they
    help to solve?



    **ANSWER:**


    The steps outlined in the text are designed to help resolve a situation where

    a Verus node''s blockchain has diverged from the correct chain, and the node is
    no longer in sync with the rest of the network. The steps allow the user to identify
    the earliest block that is causing the divergence, invalidate that block, and
    then resynchronize the node with the correct chain.

    ### Question Context Validation

    #### Special Term Context Check: specifically check for use of the terms "the
    text", "passage", and "excerpt". This question asks about "the text" without providing
    any context about the contents of this text.

    #### Scope and Precision: The question asks about "the steps outlined in the text",
    without specifying which steps are being considered, making this a vague question
    that lacks the context to be answers. Thus, this question fails this step.


    ### Answer Context Validation:

    #### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "the
    text", "passage", and "excerpt". This answer references "the text" without being
    clear about what "the text" is.

    #### Answer-Only Context Issues: Confirm that the answer does not introduce new
    and vague context that the question does not. The answer mentions "the text",
    but this was already introduced by the question. The question''s doing so was
    flawed, but the answer still does not introduce new, vague context that the question
    does not. So this passes.

    #### Answer Anchor Link Check: The answer does not use any anchor links.


    ### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:

    #### Evaluation: Some checks related to the question or answer failed. So this
    question and answer should be reworded if they can be, or fail otherwise. The
    question (and the answer) both lack context in mentioning *which* "text" they
    refer to, and what its contents are. However, I do not know what text the question
    is referring to, so I can''t add this information. The question without reference
    to a specific text would be "What is the purpose of the steps, and what problem
    do they help to solve?" which is too broad and does not make sense. I cannot fix
    this by rewording it. Therefore, this fails.

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.

- content: "**QUESTION:**\n\nHow do I mint and burn tokens on the Verus network, and\
    \ what are some potential use cases for these tokens?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\nOn the\
    \ Verus network, minting and burning tokens are essential functions that allow\
    \ for the creation and management of tokens. Here's a step-by-step guide on how\
    \ to mint and burn tokens, as well as some potential use cases for these tokens.\n\
    \n**Minting Tokens:**\nTo mint tokens, you can use the `sendcurrency` command.\
    \ For example, let's say you want to mint 10,000 VGG tokens and send them to a\
    \ customer's wallet. You would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST\
    \ sendcurrency \"VGG@\" '[{\n \"address\":\"Customer1@\", \n \"currency\":\"VGG\"\
    , \n \"mintnew\":1, \n \"amount\":10000\n}]'\n```\nIn this command, `VGG@` is\
    \ the change address, `Customer1@` is the address where the 10,000 VGG tokens\
    \ are minted to, and `amount` specifies the number of tokens to mint.\n\n**Burning\
    \ Tokens:**\nTo burn tokens, you can also use the `sendcurrency` command. For\
    \ example, let's say you want to burn 5,000 VGG tokens from the supply. You would\
    \ use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"VGG@\"\
    \ '[{\n \"address\":\"VGG@\", \n \"currency\": \"VGG\", \n \"amount\": 5000, \n\
    \ \"burn\":true\n}]'\n```\nIn this command, `VGG@` is the address where the tokens\
    \ are burned from, `amount` specifies the number of tokens to burn, and `burn`\
    \ is set to `true` to indicate that the tokens should be burned.\n\n**Checking\
    \ Token Supply:**\nTo check the supply of a token, you can use the `getcurrency`\
    \ command. For example, to check the supply of VGG tokens, you would use the following\
    \ command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency \"vgg\"\n```\n**Use Cases:**\n\
    Now that we've covered minting and burning tokens, let's explore some potential\
    \ use cases for these tokens. One example is using tokens as a reserve in a multi-reserve\
    \ liquidity basket AMM (automated market maker) as part of Verus DeFi. This allows\
    \ for the creation of complex financial instruments that can be traded on the\
    \ Verus network.\n\nAnother example is exporting tokens to other blockchain networks,\
    \ such as Ethereum, as ERC-20 tokens. This allows for the creation of tokens that\
    \ can be used across multiple blockchain ecosystems.\n\nAdditionally, tokens can\
    \ be used to create multi-reserve currencies, where the reserves grow as they\
    \ retain a small fee whenever assets are traded in/out/through. These multi-reserve\
    \ currencies can then be used as reserves in another multi-reserve liquidity basket\
    \ AMM, creating a complex and interconnected financial system.\n\nOverall, the\
    \ Verus network provides a powerful platform for creating and managing tokens,\
    \ with a wide range of potential use cases and applications.\n\n----------------\n\
    Reminder 1: references to previous steps or questions are OK, since this question\
    \ may be one of a sequence. However, references to a \"text\" or \"this context\"\
    \ in the question are not.\nReminder 2: If you choose to reword the question,\
    \ you must always write the reworded question below your judgement, under the\
    \ heading \"### Question Rewording\"."
