    "How do I create a PBaaS chain on the Verus testnet?",
    "To create a PBaaS chain on the Verus testnet, you need to follow a few steps. \n\nFirst, you need to obtain some VRSCTEST coins, which is the native cryptocurrency of the Verus testnet. You can do this by mining them yourself or by asking for some from friendly test-net whales in the Verus Discord community. Once you have some VRSCTEST coins, you need to wait for your wallet to sync fully so that you can see your coins in your balance.\n\nNext, navigate to the PBaaS tab in your wallet and click on the \"Create\" option. This will open up a form where you can specify the details of your PBaaS chain. You can choose a name for your chain and customize various options to make it unique. These options include whether you want a premine, how large it should be, how the reward schedule should be outlined, and how much you want to reward notaries for securing your chain.\n\nWhen filling out the form, make sure to specify the initial notarization offer in step 4, which is the amount of VRSCTEST coins you need to pay to start the chain. You need to ensure that your balance can cover this amount.\n\nOnce you have filled out the form, submit it and your PBaaS chain will be created on the Verus testnet. You can then use it to create your own blockchain-based application or service.",
