    "What are some potential digital goods economies that could emerge around successful influencers using Verus technology, and how could an economic model be designed to capture value for the issuing influencer?",
    "The Verus technology has the potential to enable a wide range of digital goods economies to emerge around successful influencers. These economies could be based on various digital goods that can be created, traded, and used by fans to show support, access exclusive content, or participate in events. Some examples of such digital goods include:\n\n1. **Fan IDs**: Creating a unique fan ID or address could become a status symbol or a way to show support for an influencer.\n2. **NFTs**: Influencers or their fans could create digital collectibles, art, or memorabilia that can be auctioned, sold, or given away.\n3. **Fan Profiles**: Updateable and verifiable fan profiles could be created, allowing fans to showcase their support and engagement with the influencer.\n4. **Tickets**: Digital objects could represent tickets to events, allowing fans to purchase and store them securely.\n5. **Coupons/Gift Cards**: Digital objects could represent coupons or gift cards that give fans discounts on merchandise or events.\n6. **Discount Codes**: Digital objects could provide ongoing discounts on merchandise or events.\n7. **Memberships**: Digital objects could grant exclusive membership to influencer clubs or forums.\n8. **Log-in/Access**: Digital objects could give fans access to exclusive websites or digital arenas.\n9. **Voting**: Digital objects could be used to signal support for initiatives, ideas, or proposals.\n\nTo capture value for the issuing influencer, an economic model could be designed that does not require selling tokens directly to the public. Instead, social tokens could be treated as commodities or goods that can be acquired to show support or used to acquire digital goods. This approach would allow influencers to issue tokens without worrying about securities laws.\n\nThe beauty of this model is that it can thrive even without continuous activity from the issuer. Community-created activity could persist and generate value for all parties involved. The possibilities for digital goods economies are endless, and the \"long tail\" of creative ideas will likely emerge as the technology advances.",
    "or voting\nImmediately we see that meaningful digital goods economies could spring up around successful influencers. Examples of such digital goods would be:\nFan IDs \u2014 the simple act of creating a fan ID/address for just a few dollars could be seen as a show of support, or status symbol in an influencer community; or fans could create and trade meaningful IDs\nNfts \u2014 influencers, or even their fans, could create digital collectibles/art/memorabilia to be auctioned, sold or given away to fans\nFan Profiles \u2014 updateable, verifiable fan profiles are possible\nTicket \u2014 an object could represent a ticket to an event\nCoupons/gift cards \u2014 an object could represent a right to buy merch\nDiscount Codes \u2014 an object might give a right to get ongoing discounts on merch or events\nMemberships \u2014 an object can provide exclusive membership to influencer clubs or forums\nLog-in/access \u2014 an object can give rights to enter websites or other digital arenas\nVoting \u2014 objects could be used to signal support for an initiative, idea or proposal\nThis is far from an exhaustive list, and the \u201clong tail\u201d will surely draw out ideas which we\u2019re not even capable of conceiving right now. Many of these goods would be automatic or community created and so could thrive even without continuous activity from the issuer. This is important for the longevity of the social token economy. It\u2019s not difficult to see how strong community-created activity could thrive and persist.\nAn Economic Model for the Digital Goods \u2014 to capture value for the issuing influencer (and others), there is no necessity ever to sell tokens directly to the public (which might bring securities laws into the issue anyway). The social tokens would always be just a commodity/good/coupon that can be acquired to show support, or to be used (exclusively) to acquire digital goods like those described above. An issuer would always, likely, issue \u201cfre",
