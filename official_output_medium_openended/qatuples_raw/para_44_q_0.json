    "What are some of the benefits and features of VerusIDs, especially with the PBaaS upgrade, and how can they be used to launch new blockchain economies and currencies?",
    "VerusIDs offer a range of benefits and features that make them a powerful tool for users. One of the key advantages is the ability to timelock an ID, which allows users to protect their funds even if their secret keys are compromised.\n\nWith the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs gain a new capability that amounts to an unlimited, rent-free indexed database for every VerusID on every blockchain of the PBaaS network. This database can be used to store and manage a wide range of data, including encrypted and publicly accessible information. This feature has many potential applications, such as social networking, voting systems, oracles, publishing, and more.\n\nThe scalability of PBaaS and VerusID content multimaps makes the Verus PBaaS network an ideal platform for storing and managing large amounts of human data, which can be used to train AI models and enable them to learn about humanity.\n\nAnother key benefit of Verus is its permissionless nature, which allows users to launch new blockchain economies and currencies without needing permission from a central authority. This makes it an ideal platform for crowdfunding, selling identities, and launching new blockchain-based projects. The Verus platform provides a range of tools and features that make it easy to launch new tokens, currencies, and blockchain economies, including the ability to export tokens and supply to other blockchain networks, such as Ethereum.\n\nOverall, VerusIDs and the PBaaS upgrade provide a powerful and flexible platform for users to manage their identities, store and manage data, and launch new blockchain-based projects.",
    "d the ability to timelock your ID, enabling you to even thwart attempts to access your funds after someone compromised your secret keys.\nWith the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs also gain a powerful new capability that amounts to an unlimited, rent-free indexed database for every VerusID on every blockchain of the PBaaS network. This data can be encrypted or published in the clear and used for any purpose or application, whether social networking, voting, oracles, publishing any information, various forms of provable attestations, ratings, and much, much more. With the scalability of PBaaS and VerusID content multimaps together, the Verus PBaaS network becomes the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world. We don\u2019t believe anything else even comes close, and with the recent rise of AI, it feels great to have this come together as a core original goal at a very appropriate and important time in history.\nPermissionless Chain, Token, and Liquidity Basket Currency Launches\nWhether you are looking to crowdfund an effort in a manner much like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, sell identities to which you expect to add value or that are sub-IDs of a very cool root ID, or launch an entirely new blockchain economy and blockchain that starts with all of the Verus technology and a bridge to Verus and Ethereum from day 1, Verus is probably the best platform for you. In fact, as we were planning for the next testnet and wanted to have our own version of DAI to use in the bridge, since we want only decentralized currencies in the live mainnet bridge, we used a command to launch a token on the old testnet, exported it and all its supply to Ethereum\u2019s Goerli on the existing bridge, and that will be the DAI proxy/simulant that we will use on the new testnet. It saved us all some time, proving that Verus PBaaS will also be the eas",
