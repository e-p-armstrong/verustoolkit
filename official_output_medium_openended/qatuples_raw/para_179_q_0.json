    "How does the value of a community currency, such as CommCurr, fluctuate based on its supply and demand, and how can the community capture value from it?",
    "The value of a community currency, like CommCurr, is dynamic and can fluctuate based on its supply and demand. CommCurr has a floating conversion rate and a dynamically expanding and retracting supply, which means that its value can increase or decrease depending on the demand for the currency.\n\nTo capture value from CommCurr, the community can engineer the currency to be partially backed, for example, at 80%. This is achieved by setting an initial supply of CommCurr and contributing a corresponding amount of reserves, both in USD and Verus. The community currency issuer would then own the initial supply of CommCurr, which is backed by real value.\n\nHowever, if the issuer were to convert their initial holdings of CommCurr into USD, they would deplete the reserves and drive down the value of the currency. To avoid this, the issuer can encourage the community to use CommCurr by promoting its use, offering discounts on community services, or incentivizing others to do so. As the community starts to acquire CommCurr by contributing USD into the reserves, and the issuer does not sell any of their initial holdings, the value of CommCurr will begin to increase.\n\nIn summary, the value of CommCurr is influenced by its supply and demand, and the community can capture value from it by engineering the currency to be partially backed and encouraging its use within the community.",
    "e value of CommCurr will decrease a little. In other words, CommCurr has a dynamically expanding and retracting supply, and a floating conversion rate, depending on the demand for the currency.\nCapturing the Contributed Value\nWhen creating CommCurr the best way to capture value for the community will be to create the currency so that it is only partially backed. For this sample case study, let\u2019s say it\u2019s backed at 80%. A community can easily engineer this precise amount of backing (which never changes, as a percentage, through the life of the currency) by choosing an initial supply of CommCurr, say 1 million, and then contributing 760,000 USD as reserves, and 40,000 dollars worth of Verus as reserves. We\u2019ll avoid going into detailed mechanics here but the result would be that, upon the launch of the currency, the community currency issuer would own 1,000,000 CommCurr, which is 80% backed by real value, but is convertible, as its initial price to acquire or to sell, 1:1 with the USD.\nNow, as we described above, if the issuer just starts converting their initial holdings of CommCurr (1 million units) into USD, they\u2019ll start depleting the reserves and driving down the value of the currency. In fact, if they just dumped it all, they\u2019d get all their initially contributed reserves back and the currency would be rendered virtually worthless. So, instead of doing that, they\u2019ll encourage use by the community. Perhaps they\u2019ll simply promote its use, or maybe they\u2019ll offer small discounts on community services, and encourage others to do so, to bootstrap use. The overall idea would be to encourage use by the community at large. If use emerges, and people start to acquire the currency (by contributing USD into the reserves), and the issuing community does not sell any of its initial holdings, the value of CommCurr will begin to creep up (provided that not all of this currency is ",
