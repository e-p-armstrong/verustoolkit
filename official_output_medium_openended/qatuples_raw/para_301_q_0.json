    "What are the steps to set up and sync Verus and Komodo wallets, including enabling KMD support and restoring wallet.dat files?",
    "To set up and sync Verus and Komodo wallets, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Launch Verus Wallet**\nAfter completing the download, close the modal and select VRSC from \"Native Mode\". Verus will launch and begin to sync. This process may take a few minutes. Allow the sync to reach 100% before proceeding.\n\n**Step 2: Launch Komodo Wallet (Optional)**\nIf you're including KMD support in your Verus wallet or installing Verus alongside Agama, you'll need to launch Komodo wallet. Close the Verus wallet and wait for it to shut down completely before proceeding. Then, launch Verus wallet and choose KMD from the \"Native Mode\" dropdown list. Komodo will launch and begin to sync. This process may take a few minutes. Allow the sync to reach 100%.\n\n**Step 3: Activate Coin and Add VRSC in Native Mode**\nAfter Komodo has fully synced, it is safe to click \"Activate Coin\" and add VRSC in Native mode. This may take some time, but after several minutes, both wallets will display, both in Native mode at 100% each.\n\n**Step 4: Restore wallet.dat Files (If Necessary)**\nIf you cleared out the contents of your hidden VRSC and Komodo folders during the update process, you now need to restore your original wallet.dat files. First, close Verus wallet and wait for it to shut down completely. Then, copy your backed up wallet.dat files back into their appropriate folders.\n\n**Restoring wallet.dat Files on Linux:**\nTo restore the backup, open a Terminal window and go to your home folder using `cd ~`. Then, restore the KMD wallet with `cp BK-komodo/wallet.dat .komodo` and restore the VRSC wallet with `cp BK-komodo/VRSC/wallet.dat .komodo/VRSC`.\n\n**Restoring wallet.dat Files on Windows:**\nClick Start and type `%appdata%` then hit ENTER. Then, copy the wallet.dat file with the correct path.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully set up and sync Verus and Komodo wallets, including enabling KMD support and restoring wallet.dat files.",
