    "What is VerusHash 2.0, and how does it aim to promote decentralization and equalize mining across different hardware platforms on the Verus network?",
    "VerusHash 2.0 is a hashing algorithm designed to address the gap in hash power between Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Central Processing Units (CPUs) on the Verus network. The primary goal of VerusHash 2.0 is to promote decentralization by allowing more people to participate in mining Verus Coin, thus creating a stronger network.\n\nTo achieve this, VerusHash 2.0 is designed to better equalize mining across all hardware platforms, favoring the latest CPUs over older types. This approach is intended to reduce the centralizing potential of botnets and create a more level playing field for miners.\n\nThe strategy behind VerusHash 2.0 involves leveraging a range of hardware characteristics across different target hardware, rather than simply advantaging a small number of integrated CPU instructions. This approach aims to place more of a burden on some weaknesses of FPGAs, making it more feasible for CPUs and other hardware platforms to contribute to the network.\n\nBy promoting decentralization and equalizing mining opportunities across different hardware platforms, VerusHash 2.0 aims to create a stronger, more resilient network that is open to participation from a wider range of people. This, in turn, can help to ensure the long-term health and security of the Verus network.",
    "E, YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE MAIN VERUS CHAIN AFTER BLOCK 310000, WHICH WILL BE MINED ON DECEMBER 28, 2018.\nVerusHash 2.0\nVerusHash 2.0 is explicitly designed to address the gap in hash power that FPGAs have over CPUs today on the Verus network. While initial activation will likely mean no FPGAs (and possibly even no GPUs) on the Verus network at least temporarily, our goal is more equivalence across returns on various types of hardware while continuing to enable people with just a CPU to easily contribute to and join the Verus Community through mining.\nVerusHash 2.0 is designed to better equalize mining across all hardware platforms, while favoring the latest CPUs over older types, which is also one defense against the centralizing potential of botnets.\nStrategy Involved in VerusHash Design\nBecause VerusHash 1.0 was designed with the Haraka V2 Core, it leveraged highly integrated instruction sets of modern CPUs and in turn GPUs didn\u2019t gain too much of an advantage when they were implemented. In the original hash, the strategy was to advantage CPUs through the use of these optimizations, and we knew we would consider adjusting the hash if hardware was made for this algorithm, however we did not have a reference point of comparison until now.\nThe goal of closing the gap between CPUs and GPUs with 1.0 was to promote decentralization, allowing more people from around the world to participate in mining Verus Coin and creating a stronger network together. Rather than simply advantaging a small number of integrated CPU instructions, using Haraka V2 Core, we have deeply considered a number of hardware characteristics across different target hardware to invent VerusHash 2.0.\nBased on efforts to ensure that the algorithm leverages a number of additional strengths of CPUs, while placing more of a burden on some weaknesses of FPGAs, specifically, we are optimistic that Ve",
