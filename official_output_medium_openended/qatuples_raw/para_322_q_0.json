    "How does the Verus Fee Pool work, and what are the different types of fees that contribute to it?",
    "The Verus Fee Pool is a mechanism that collects fees generated by various activities on the Verus protocol. These fees are then distributed to miners and stakers who help secure the network and validate transactions.\n\nThere are several types of fees that contribute to the Verus Fee Pool, including:\n\n1. **PBaaS-chain creation fees**: When a new PBaaS-chain is created on Verus, a fee of 10,000 VRSC is charged, with 5,000 VRSC going into the Verus Fee Pool and 5,000 VRSC going into the Fee Pool of the created blockchain.\n2. **Currency and token creation fees**: Creating a new currency or token on Verus costs 200 VRSC, which goes into the Verus Fee Pool.\n3. **VerusID fees**: Miners and stakers pay fees for VerusID registrations, which range from 20 to 100 VRSC depending on the type of ID.\n4. **SubID fees**: Creating subIDs under launched currencies and tokens costs 0.02 VRSC.\n5. **Conversion fees**: Each time a user converts between currencies, a fee of 0.025% or 0.05% is charged, with 50% of this fee going to miners and stakers.\n6. **Transaction fees**: Each transaction on Verus has a minimum fee of 0.0001 VRSC.\n\nThese fees are collected and distributed to miners and stakers who participate in the validation process, providing an additional incentive for them to secure the network. The Verus Fee Pool is designed to provide a significant source of revenue for miners and stakers, potentially exceeding the coinbase rewards.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Verus protocol is a multichain protocol, which means that each PBaaS-chain also has its own Fee Pool that collects fees from similar activities. Miners and stakers can merge-mine up to 22 chains, allowing them to benefit from the fees generated by multiple chains with the same hashrate as mining only Verus.",
    " for finding a new block), they also take a small portion of the Fee Pool. The Fee Pool collects fees that are paid by users when they are interacting with the protocol. Protocol fees include:\nPBaaS-chain: creating a blockchain on Verus costs 10,000 VRSC. 5,000 VRSC goes into the Verus Fee Pool, and 5,000 VRSC goes into the Fee Pool of the created blockchain, earned by miners and stakers of that blockchain\n(DeFi) Currency and tokens: creating a currency on the Verus blockchain costs 200 VRSC\nVerusID: identity fees for miners and stakers are 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100 VRSC\nsubID: under launched currencies and tokens subIDs can be created, these cost 0.02 VRSC\nConversion fees: each time a user converts currencies it costs 0.025% or 0.05% \u2014 miners and stakers get 50% of these fees\nTransaction fees: each transaction is minimally 0.0001 VRSC\nMiners and stakers are protecting the blockchain and at the same time servicing the Verus economy. We expect the Fee Pool rewards to exceed the coinbase rewards.\nThink about it: someone creates a PBaaS-chain, 5,000 VRSC goes to the Fee Pool, the winner of the next block gets 50 VRSC extra on top of the coinbase reward. Now imagine a whole lot of economic activity: users making conversions through the protocol, registering VerusIDs, creating DeFi currencies and tokens, and the Fee Pool can get quite large.\nVerus Fee Pool. Percentage is subject to change before hitting mainnet.\nMerge-Mine up to 22 Chains\nThe example above is only for mining Verus directly. Keep in mind that Verus is a multichain protocol. All PBaaS-chains in the protocol have exactly the same specifications as the Verus mainchain. They too have a Fee Pool that collects fees through VerusID registrations, conversions, DeFi currency and tokens and even in a later stage also PBaaS-chains!\nAnd you can mine 22 of them! All with the same hashrate as you would when mining only Verus",
