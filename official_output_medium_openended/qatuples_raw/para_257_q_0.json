    "What are the key features of the Verus system that enable fair and transparent transactions, and how do fractional reserve currencies work within the system?",
    "The Verus system has several key features that enable fair and transparent transactions. One of the most important is the ability to interact with the system knowing that everyone will get the fair price for their transaction, with zero spread. This means that all buys and sells submitted within a block will be executed at the exact same price, ensuring fairness and transparency for all participants.\n\nAnother key feature is the ability to launch new currencies on-chain, using a command line interface (with a dashboard interface in development). This allows anyone to mint their own token, pegged to any currency or asset, giving users a high degree of flexibility and control.\n\nWithin the Verus system, fractional reserve currencies can be defined with any other currencies, with or without fractional reserve capabilities. This means that the creators of a new coin can choose to assign a percentage of the reserve, with a minimum of 10%. For example, if the creators of a new coin deposit an amount of VRSC (or other currencies) into the reserve, this enables anyone holding the new coin to convert it into VRSC or from VRSC into the new coin. This eliminates the need for coin creators to rely on exchange listings and pay high fees to access markets and liquidity pools.\n\nFractional reserve token currencies require the native currency of the chain to be part of their reserves, and PBaaS chains with fractional capabilities must contain their parent chain's native currency. This reserve requirement supports the network effect and growth in power of the public protocol, resulting in full, programmatic liquidity across the entire worldwide multi-chain system. This allows each independent currency to be liquid and have value based on its intrinsic properties and the velocity of its use.\n\nAdditionally, the funding of the reserve can be structured like a Kickstarter campaign, with minimum launch requirements and automatic refunds if the minimum is not met. This provides an incentive for people to participate and support new currency launches.",

On-chain Currency Launches\nThe latest testnet release allows anyone to use the command line (under development \u2014 an easy to use dashboard) to freely mint their own token, pegged to any currency or asset.\nFractional Reserve Option\nCurrencies can be defined with any other currencies with (or without) fractional reserve capabilities; those who launch a currency and choose a fractional reserve may also assign a percentage, with the minimum being ten percent.\nIf the creators of a new coin choose to deposit an amount of VRSC in the reserve \u2014 or Verus and a few other currencies to make up that coin\u2019s basket \u2014 that reserve enables anyone holding the new coin to convert this new coin into VRSC or from VRSC into that new coin. With this, coin creators no longer have to rely on exchange listings and paying high fees to access markets and liquidity pools. An incentive for people to participate in this can be a discounted price during the funding period.\nFractional reserve token currencies will need to have the native currency of the chain as part of their reserves, and PBaaS chains that have fractional capabilities will have to contain their parent chain\u2019s native currency. The reserve requirement is similar in that respect to Bancor, supports the network effect and growth in power of the public protocol, and will result in full, programmatic liquidity across the entirety of the worldwide multi-chain system.
