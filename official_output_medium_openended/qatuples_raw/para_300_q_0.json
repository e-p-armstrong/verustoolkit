    "What are the steps to bootstrap Verus and Komodo on both Linux and Windows, and what considerations should be taken when launching the Verus wallet for the first time?",
    "To bootstrap Verus and Komodo on both Linux and Windows, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1-3: Bootstrap Verus**\nTo bootstrap Verus, you'll need to download the VRSC bootstrap file and unpack it into the correct directory. On Linux, you can do this by running the command `tar -xvf VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz -C ~/.komodo/VRSC` in the terminal. On Windows, you can download the file from `https://bootstrap.0x03.services/veruscoin/VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz` and then unzip it into the `%appdata%\\Komodo\\VRSC` folder. Make sure to delete the contents of the folder first, but be sure to back up your `wallet.dat` file.\n\n**Step 4 (Optional): Bootstrap Komodo**\nIf you want to use Komodo alongside Verus, or if you want to have KMD native support within the Verus wallet, you'll need to sync the entire Komodo blockchain. To do this, you can download the latest KMD bootstrap file and unpack it into the correct directory. On Linux, you can do this by running the command `wget https://bootstrap.0x03.services/komodo/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz` followed by `tar -xvf KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz -C ~/.komodo`. On Windows, you can download the file from `https://bootstrap.0x03.services/komodo/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz` and then unzip it into the `%appdata%\\Komodo` folder.\n\n**Step 5: Launch Verus Wallet**\nWhen launching the Verus wallet for the first time, you'll need to choose VRSC under the \"Native Mode\" dropdown. You'll then be prompted to download the latest Zcash Params, which you should follow the steps to do so. Note that new `wallet.dat` files will be generated in the `.komodo/VRSC` folder during the first launch of the updated Verus wallet while it syncs up. If you're updating from a previous version, you'll need to overwrite these files with your backed-up `wallet.dat` file later.\n\nIn general, bootstrapping Verus and Komodo involves downloading and unpacking the necessary files into the correct directories, and then launching the Verus wallet for the first time and following the prompts to download the latest Zcash Params.",
