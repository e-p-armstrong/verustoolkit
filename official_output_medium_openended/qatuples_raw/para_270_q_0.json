    "What is the vision behind the Verus project, and how does it aim to address the issues of individual atomization, lack of self-sovereignty, and unreliable centralized services in the current digital landscape?",
    "The Verus project envisions a future where individuals have complete control over their digital lives, free from the constraints of centralized services and walled-garden networks. The current digital landscape has led to the atomization of individuals, forcing them to rely on centralized authorities to earn a living, learn, or engage in social and cultural activities. Verus seeks to change this by providing a foundation for a new programming platform, network, and interface that prioritizes self-sovereignty, security, and privacy.\n\nThe project aims to achieve this by creating a decentralized and distributed system that is open, equitable, and runs on reliable public infrastructure. This would replace the current unreliable, restrictive, and extractive centralized services, allowing individuals to regain control over their digital lives.\n\nVerus also recognizes the importance of security as a fundamental aspect of the system, rather than an add-on. The project seeks to make security, through asymmetric cryptography, a ground state, where it is an integral part of the system from the beginning, rather than a patchwork of standards and protocols added later. This approach would provide a more robust and lasting security solution.\n\nBy achieving this vision, Verus hopes to play a foundational role in the current Bell's Law shift, which is marked by the emergence of decentralized and distributed networks, such as those pioneered by Bitcoin. The project's developers bring their expertise in application platform creation to enable global-scale distributed and decentralized systems, marking the beginning of a new era in digital technology.",
    "ill. The individual has been atomized and vassal-ized, forced to pledge fealty to walled-garden network kings in order to earn a living, to learn or to engage in social or cultural life.\nIn this respect, the preferred benefits of the current Bell\u2019s Law shift would be (i) reduced complexity, (ii) security and privacy as initial and persisting states of the system (not after the fact add-ons), and (iii) self-sovereignty and personal control everywhere. Unreliable, restrictive, extractive centralized services could be replaced by distributed systems that are open and equitable running on reliable public infrastructure.\nVerus is an ambitious project that seeks to provide a foundation for this new programming platform, network and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new industry. Verus seeks to be a foundational part of the current Bell\u2019s Law shift, believing that the decentralized and distributed networks pioneered by Bitcoin have marked the beginning of this shift. The Verus developers bring specific experience in application platform creation and seek to enlarge on this by enabling the global-scale distributed and decentralized systems that mark the new era.\nSecurity as the Ground State\nPublic-key cryptography algorithms are now fundamental ingredients of our data storage, communications and computing systems. But, at the moment, these cryptosystems are not at the core of our computing. Over the last two decades they\u2019ve been layered onto our existing systems through various standards and protocols. The patchwork non-core nature leaves security wanting and difficult to achieve in a lasting and universal way.\nWhat appears to be emerging, though, are systems where security, through asymmetric cryptography, is the ground state. The bitcoin whitepaper laid out \u201can electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust\u201d, thus creating ",
