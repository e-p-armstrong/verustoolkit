    "How does Verus address the security concerns and limitations of traditional blockchain protocols, particularly regarding smart contracts and scalability?",
    "Verus takes a unique approach to addressing the security concerns and limitations of traditional blockchain protocols. One of the key measures is the introduction of the Fee Pool, which spreads extra fees over many blocks to prevent block producers from \"sniping\" blocks and destabilizing the protocol. This ensures that the protocol remains stable and secure.\n\nAnother significant difference is Verus's approach to smart contracts. Unlike most blockchain protocols that use the VM-based application model, which is prone to smart contract hacks, bugs, and phishing attacks, Verus follows a fundamental systems design principle of locating the most important security layers in the protocol itself. This means that all operations on Verus and PBaaS-chains are directly connected to consensus, secured by the miners and stakers of the protocol.\n\nVerus's approach to building dApps is also more straightforward and results in inherently more capable, secure, and scalable solutions. By not compromising on decentralization and security, Verus is able to achieve unlimited scalability without sacrificing the integrity of the protocol.\n\nIn essence, Verus solves the blockchain trilemma by providing a secure, decentralized, and scalable solution that addresses the limitations and security concerns of traditional blockchain protocols.",
    "p of the regular coinbase reward (currently 6 VRSC).\nThe Fee Pool is introduced as a security measure to keep the protocol stable. We have seen in other blockchain protocols that when a block has large fees, block producers try to \u201csnipe\u201d the block (putting lots of hash onto the network, then pulling it out of the network, or even trying to reorder the blocks for their own gain). In doing so they destabilize the protocol. Verus mitigates this behavior by spreading the extra fees over many blocks.\nSmart Contracts Are Not Secure\nMost blockchain protocols use the VM-based application model \u2014 smart contracts written with Solidity. It\u2019s full of smart contract hacks and bugs and has insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms. On top of that MEV (maximum extractable value) is rampant, due to the serial processing of transactions on the VM-model (it\u2019s easy for a block producer to reorder transactions inside a block for their own gain). We can honestly say that the VM-model is not secure.\nThe Verus approach is different as it follows the fundamental systems design principle \u2014 the most important security layers should be located in the protocol itself, and not coded on top via L2 (smart contracts). All operations on Verus and PBaaS-chains are directly connected to consensus, secured by the miners and stakers of the protocol.\nNow you might ask yourself \u201cBut can we build dApps that are as capable as building them with the VM-model?\u201d. The answer is yes. Developing dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions.\nDoes Verus Solve the Blockchain Trilemma?\nA fair question. And hopefully we answered with enough detail. The answer is \u201cyes!\u201d.\nLet\u2019s summarize. Verus does not compromise on decentralization and security to reach unlimited scalability.
