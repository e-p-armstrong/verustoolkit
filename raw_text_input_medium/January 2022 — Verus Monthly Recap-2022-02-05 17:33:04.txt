Last month a lot of quiet progress was made on the development of the Verus multichain protocol. A new public testnet is on the verge of release with additional core protocol features. All effort is put into making Verus a decentralized and robust protocol that just works.
Exporting Currencies
Currencies on one PBaaS-blockchain can be exported to any other PBaaS-blockchain. This means that a currency can easily be made available on multiple blockchains.
An example: we have CHICKEN-currency on a PBaaS-chain and want it to be available on the Verus-blockchain as well. We export CHICKEN-currency to the Verus-blockchain for a fee and now CHICKEN-currency is available there too. It goes without saying that all fees go to the miners and stakers of the network.
We can pay this fee in whatever currency we want, as long as it is available in the bridge-converter.
This fee is defined by the PBaaS-chain where you want the currency to be exported to, and thus can differ within all the multiple blockchains in the network.
Fee Structures
On the previous public testnet you could only make transactions if you had the native currency of the blockchain. Now you can use any currency that is in the bridge-converter as a fee to do operations on any PBaaS-blockchain.
Any currency on a blockchain can be used as fees to do transactions. Example: if you have USDC on the Verus-blockchain you don’t need VRSC to send the USDC around. It automatically converts a small fee of USDC to VRSC through a bridge-converter and uses that as its transaction fee.
This is an incredibly hard problem to solve. Yet it is working now on internal Verus test builds.
