VaultAlert: Check Your Vault Anywhere
Users can lock their funds in a VerusID with Vault. If Vault is activated, your funds are locked and can not be spent any more, while you are still able to stake.

It will tell you everything you need to know about your Vault. Vault status, type of lock, unlock blockheight and date estimates.
The first release of VaultAlert is estimated to be in January. Stay tuned! ⏰
