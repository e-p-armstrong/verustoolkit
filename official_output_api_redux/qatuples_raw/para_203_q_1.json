    "How can I use the `getnetworkhashps` command to estimate the network speed at a specific block height?",
    "To estimate the network speed at a specific block height, you can pass the height as an argument to the `getnetworkhashps` command. For example, `getnetworkhashps 0 100` would estimate the network speed at block height 100.",
