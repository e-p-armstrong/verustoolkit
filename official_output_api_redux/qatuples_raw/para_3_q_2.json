    "What is the default behavior of the `heightstart` and `heightend` parameters in the `getidentitycontent` command?",
    "By default, `heightstart` is set to 0, meaning that the command will return content from the genesis block (height 0) forward, inclusive. `heightend` is set to 0 by default, which means the command will return content up to the current maximum height. If `heightend` is set to -1, the command will also return values from the mempool.",
