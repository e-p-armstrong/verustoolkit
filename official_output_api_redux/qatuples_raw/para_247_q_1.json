    "What are the arguments required for the `fundrawtransaction` command?",
    "The `fundrawtransaction` command requires at least one argument, which is the hex string of the raw transaction. Optionally, it can take three more arguments: an object array of UTXOs to select from for funding, an address to send change to if there is any, and an explicit fee to offer instead of the default fee.",
