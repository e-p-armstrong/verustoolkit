    "What are the components of a currency definition in Verus, and what do they represent?",
    "In Verus, a currency definition consists of several components, including:\n\n* `conversions`: an array of pre-launch conversion rates for non-fractional currencies\n* `minpreconversion`: an array of minimum amounts required in pre-conversions for a currency to launch\n* `currencies`: an array of currencies that can be converted to this currency at launch or make up a liquidity basket\n* `currencynames`: an object mapping i-addresses to fully qualified names of all sub-currencies\n* `initialsupply`: the initial currency supply for fractional currencies before preallocation or issuance\n* `prelaunchcarveout`: the pre-launch percentage of proceeds for fractional currency sent to the launching ID\n* `preallocations`: an array of VerusIDs and amounts for pre-allocation at launch\n* `initialcontributions`: an array of amounts of pre-conversions reserved for the launching ID\n* `idregistrationfees`: the base cost of IDs for this currency namespace in this currency\n* `idreferrallevels`: the levels of ID referrals (only for native PBaaS chains and IDs)\n* `idimportfees`: the fees required to import an ID to this system (only for native PBaaS chains and IDs)\n* `eras`: an array of objects representing different chain phases of rewards and convertibility, including reward start, decay, halving, and era end.\n\nThese components define the properties and behavior of a currency in Verus.",
