Splices a joinsplit into rawtx. Inputs are unilaterally confidential.\nOutputs are confidential between sender/receiver. The vpub_old and\nvpub_new values are globally public and move transparent value into\nor out of the confidential value store, respectively.\n\nNote: The caller is responsible for delivering the output enc1 and\nenc2 to the appropriate recipients, as well as signing rawtxout and\nensuring it is mined.
