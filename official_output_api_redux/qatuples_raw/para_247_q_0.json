    "What is the purpose of the `fundrawtransaction` command?",
    "The `fundrawtransaction` command is used to add inputs to a transaction until it has enough value to meet its output value. It will not modify existing inputs and will add one change output to the outputs. The inputs added will not be signed, and the user will need to use the `signrawtransaction` command to sign them.",
