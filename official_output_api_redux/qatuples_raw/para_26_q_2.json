    "What is the \"softforks\" property in the result of the `getblockchaininfo` command?",
    "The \"softforks\" property in the result of the `getblockchaininfo` command is an array that provides the status of softforks in progress. Each softfork is represented by an object that includes its name, version, and progress toward enforcing or rejecting the softfork rules for new-version blocks.",
