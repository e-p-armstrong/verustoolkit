    "What is the purpose of the `definecurrency` command in Verus?",
    "The `definecurrency` command is used to define a new blockchain currency, either as an independent blockchain or as a token on an existing blockchain. It also activates the currency for an identity name and sets a bit indicating that it has a currently active blockchain in its name.",
    "definecurrency '{\"name\": \"coinortokenname\", ..., \"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"identity\"},..]}'\\\n        '({\"name\": \"fractionalgatewayname\", ..., })' ({\"name\": \"reserveonename\", ..., }) ...This defines a blockchain currency, either as an independent blockchain, or as a token on this blockchain. It also spends\nthe identity after which this currency is named and sets a bit indicating that it has a currently active blockchain in its name.To create a currency of any kind, the identity it is named after must be minted on the blockchain on which the currency is created.\nOnce a currency is activated for an identity name, the same symbol may not be reused for another currency or blockchain, even\nif the identity is transferred, revoked or recovered, unless there is an endblock specified and the currency or blockchain has\ndeactivated as of that end block.All funds to start the currency and for initial conversion amounts must be available to spend from the identity with the same\nname and ID as the currency being defined.Arguments\n   {\n     \"options\" : n,         (int,  optional) bits (in hexadecimal):\n                               1 = FRACTIONAL\n                               2 = IDRESTRICTED\n                               4 = IDSTAKING\n                               8 = IDREFERRALS\n                               0x10 = IDREFERRALSREQUIRED\n                               0x20 = TOKEN\n                               0x40 = RESERVED\n                               0x100 = IS_PBAAS_CHAIN",
