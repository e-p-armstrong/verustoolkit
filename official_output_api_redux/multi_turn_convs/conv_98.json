    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the Verus commands and I'm wondering, what is the purpose of the `getblockdeltas` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblockdeltas` command returns information about a given block and its transactions in Verus. It's a really useful tool for exploring the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nI tried using it, but it didn't seem to work. Why does the `getblockdeltas` command not work by default?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblockdeltas` command is disabled by default. To enable it, you need to restart Verus with the `-experimentalfeatures` and `-insightexplorer` command-line options, or add these two lines to the Verus configuration file: `experimentalfeatures=1` and `insightexplorer=1`. Once you do that, it should work as expected.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, what's the required argument for the `getblockdeltas` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required argument for the `getblockdeltas` command is the block hash, which must be a string. Just pass in the block hash you're interested in, and the command will return the relevant information.",
