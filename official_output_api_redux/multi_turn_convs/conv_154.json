    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been using Verus for a while now, and I was wondering about the `signrawtransaction` command. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `signrawtransaction` command in Verus signs a raw transaction and returns the signed transaction in hex format, along with information about the transaction's completeness and any errors that may have occurred during the signing process.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What's the format of the result returned by the `signrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `signrawtransaction` command is a JSON object with three properties: `hex`, `complete`, and `errors`. The `hex` property contains the hex-encoded raw transaction with signature(s). The `complete` property is a boolean indicating whether the transaction has a complete set of signatures. The `errors` property is a JSON array of objects, each containing information about script verification errors that may have occurred.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What kind of information is included in each error object in the `errors` array?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach error object in the `errors` array includes the following information: `txid` (the hash of the referenced, previous transaction), `vout` (the index of the output to be spent and used as input), `scriptSig` (the hex-encoded signature script), `sequence` (the script sequence number), and `error` (a string describing the verification or signing error related to the input).\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's really helpful. How can I actually use the `signrawtransaction` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `signrawtransaction` command in Verus by passing a hex-encoded raw transaction as an argument, either through the Verus command-line interface or through an HTTP request using the JSON-RPC API. For example, you can use the command `verus signrawtransaction \"myhex\"` or send a JSON-RPC request with the method `signrawtransaction` and the parameter `[\"myhex\"]`.",
