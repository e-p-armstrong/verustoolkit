    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand some of the commands in Verus. Can you help me out? I'm looking at the `listopenoffers` command. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listopenoffers` command in Verus shows all the outstanding offers in the current wallet. It's a useful command to get an overview of the offers you have open.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. Are there any optional arguments I can use with this command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are two optional boolean arguments you can use with `listopenoffers`: `unexpired` and `expired`. By default, both are set to `true`.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does the `unexpired` argument do when used with the `listopenoffers` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `unexpired` is set to `true` (which is the default), the `listopenoffers` command will show all the open offers in the wallet that have not expired.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about the `expired` argument? What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `expired` is set to `true` (which is the default), the `listopenoffers` command will show all the open offers in the wallet that have expired.\n\n**User:**\nCan I use these arguments to filter out either expired or unexpired offers from the list?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use the `unexpired` and `expired` arguments to filter out either expired or unexpired offers from the list. For example, if you only want to see unexpired offers, you can set `expired` to `false`. This way, you can customize the output of the `listopenoffers` command to show only the offers that are relevant to you.",
