    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been experimenting with the Verus CLI and I came across the `getreceivedbyaccount` command. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getreceivedbyaccount` command returns the total amount of VRSC received by addresses with a specified account, considering only transactions with at least a certain number of confirmations. It's a useful tool for tracking your VRSC balance.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But what's the required format for the \"account\" argument in the `getreceivedbyaccount` command? I'm not sure what to put there.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"account\" argument must be set to an empty string (`\"\"`). That's the correct format. Just use an empty string and you should be good to go!",
