    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having some trouble with Verus and I was hoping you could help me out. What does the `z_listoperationids` command do in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_listoperationids` command returns a list of operation IDs currently known to the wallet. It can also filter the result by the operation's state, such as \"success\", if specified. Do you have a specific use case in mind for this command, or are you just curious about its functionality?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm just curious. How can I use the `z_listoperationids` command to get a list of operation IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_listoperationids` command by running `verus z_listoperationids` in the command line, or by making a JSON-RPC request to the Verus server with the method `z_listoperationids` and an empty parameter list. For example, you can use the `curl` command to make a JSON-RPC request: `curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_listoperationids\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! What is the format of the result returned by the `z_listoperationids` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `z_listoperationids` command is a JSON array of strings, where each string is an operation ID belonging to the wallet. So, you'll get a list of operation IDs that you can then use for further processing or analysis. Does that make sense?",
