    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand how to work with transactions in Verus. Can you help me with that? Specifically, what is the purpose of the `fundrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `fundrawtransaction` command is used to add inputs to a transaction until it has enough value to meet its output value. It will not modify existing inputs and will add one change output to the outputs. The inputs added will not be signed, and the user will need to use the `signrawtransaction` command to sign them. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that helps. What are the arguments required for the `fundrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `fundrawtransaction` command requires at least one argument, which is the hex string of the raw transaction. Optionally, it can take three more arguments: an object array of UTXOs to select from for funding, an address to send change to if there is any, and an explicit fee to offer instead of the default fee.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what is the result of the `fundrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `fundrawtransaction` command is a JSON object containing three properties: \"hex\" (the resulting raw transaction as a hex-encoded string), \"fee\" (the fee added to the transaction), and \"changepos\" (the position of the added change output, or -1 if no change output was added).\n\n**User:**\nBefore I fund the transaction, I need to create it. How do I create a transaction with no inputs using the `createrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a transaction with no inputs using the `createrawtransaction` command by providing an empty array as the first argument and a JSON object specifying the output as the second argument. For example: `verus createrawtransaction \"[]\" \"{\"myaddress\":0.01}\"`\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I understand. Can you walk me through the steps to create and send a transaction using the Verus command-line interface?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction with no inputs using the `createrawtransaction` command.\n2. Add sufficient unsigned inputs to meet the output value using the `fundrawtransaction` command.\n3. Sign the transaction using the `signrawtransaction` command.\n4. Send the transaction using the `sendrawtransaction` command.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about any of these steps!",
