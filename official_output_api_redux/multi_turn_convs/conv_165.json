    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand cross-chain or bridged proofs in Verus, and I have a few questions about the parameters involved. What is the purpose of the \"startblock\" and \"endblock\" parameters in these proofs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"startblock\" parameter specifies the block number on the current chain that must be notarized into block one of the target chain. The \"endblock\" parameter specifies the block number after which the current chain's useful life is considered to be over. These parameters are crucial in defining the scope of the cross-chain or bridged proof.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the \"weights\" and \"conversions\" parameters? What do they represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"weights\" parameter represents the relative currency weights, which are only returned for a liquidity basket. The \"conversions\" parameter represents the pre-launch conversion rates for non-fractional currencies. These parameters help facilitate the cross-chain or bridged transaction by providing essential information about the currencies involved.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What about the \"currencynames\" parameter? What does it represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"currencynames\" parameter is an object that maps i-addresses to fully qualified names of all sub-currencies. This provides a way to identify and reference sub-currencies, which is crucial in cross-chain or bridged transactions.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I have questions about the \"preallocations\" and \"initialcontributions\" parameters. What do they represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"preallocations\" parameter is an object array that specifies VerusIDs and amounts for pre-allocation at launch. The \"initialcontributions\" parameter is a number array that specifies the amounts of pre-conversions reserved for the launching ID. These parameters help define the initial distribution of assets during the launch of a new chain or currency.",
