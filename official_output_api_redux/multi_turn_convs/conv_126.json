    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the `getblockhashes` command in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblockhashes` command returns an array of hashes of blocks within a specified timestamp range. It's a useful tool for retrieving block hashes within a specific time period.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds helpful. What are the required arguments for the `getblockhashes` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblockhashes` command requires three arguments: \n1. `high`: The newer block timestamp.\n2. `low`: The older block timestamp.\n3. `options`: A JSON object that can include options such as `noOrphans` and `logicalTimes`.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does the `noOrphans` option do when used with the `getblockhashes` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `noOrphans` option, when set to `true`, will only include blocks on the main chain in the result. This can be useful if you're only interested in blocks that are part of the main blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about the `logicalTimes` option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `logicalTimes` option, when set to `true`, will include logical timestamps with hashes in the result. This can provide additional information about the blocks in the result.\n\n**User:**\nWhat format does the result returned by the `getblockhashes` command take?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `getblockhashes` command is an array of block hashes. If the `logicalTimes` option is used, the result will include an array of objects with both the block hash and the logical timestamp.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `getblockhashes` command to retrieve block hashes within a specific timestamp range?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getblockhashes` command to retrieve block hashes within a specific timestamp range by providing the newer and older block timestamps, along with any desired options. For example:\n```\nverus getblockhashes 1231614698 1231024505 '{\"noOrphans\":false, \"logicalTimes\":true}'\n```\nThis command would retrieve block hashes between the specified timestamps, including orphans and with logical timestamps.",
