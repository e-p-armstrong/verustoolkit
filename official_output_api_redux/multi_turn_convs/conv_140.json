    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `verifytxoutproof` command in Verus. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifytxoutproof` command is used to verify that a provided proof points to a specific transaction in a block, and returns the transaction it commits to. If the block is not part of the best chain, it will throw an RPC error.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What's the required argument for the `verifytxoutproof` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required argument for the `verifytxoutproof` command is a string called \"proof\", which is a hex-encoded proof generated by the `gettxoutproof` command.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! What's the result of a successful `verifytxoutproof` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of a successful `verifytxoutproof` command is an array of strings, containing the txid(s) that the proof commits to. If the proof is invalid, an empty array is returned.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if the block referred to by the proof is not part of the best chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the block referred to by the proof is not part of the best chain, the `verifytxoutproof` command will throw an RPC error.",
