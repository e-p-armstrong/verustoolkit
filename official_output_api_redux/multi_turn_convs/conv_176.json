    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get a better understanding of the `z_gettotalbalance` command in Verus. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_gettotalbalance` command returns the total value of funds stored in the node's wallet. It provides a breakdown of the balance into transparent, private, and total funds.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What are the optional arguments for the `z_gettotalbalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_gettotalbalance` command has two optional arguments: `minconf` and `includeWatchonly`. `minconf` specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for a transaction to be included in the balance calculation, and `includeWatchonly` includes the balance in watchonly addresses in the calculation.\n\n**User:**\nI've got another question. What's the caution about when using `z_gettotalbalance` with addresses that only have incoming viewing keys?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using `z_gettotalbalance` with addresses that only have incoming viewing keys, the returned private balance may be larger than the actual balance because spends cannot be detected with incoming viewing keys. Just something to keep in mind when using the command.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question. How can I use `z_gettotalbalance` to get the total amount in my wallet with at least 5 blocks confirmed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_gettotalbalance` command with the `minconf` argument set to 5, like this: `verus z_gettotalbalance 5`. This will return the total balance in your wallet with at least 5 blocks confirmed.",
