    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get a better understanding of the `getblocktemplate` command in Verus. Can you explain what it's used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblocktemplate` command returns data needed to construct a block to work on, allowing miners to create a new block and contribute to the Verus network. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps! I was also wondering about the `mode` key in the `getblocktemplate` request parameters. What's its role?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `mode` key is used to explicitly select between the default 'template' request or a 'proposal' when using the `getblocktemplate` command. It must be set to \"template\" or omitted. Do you have any other questions about `getblocktemplate`?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What's the purpose of the `miningdistribution` object in the `getblocktemplate` request parameters?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `miningdistribution` object is used to determine the distribution of mining rewards. It contains key-value pairs where the key is a recipient address or ID, and the value is a relative weight that determines the proportion of the mining reward allocated to that recipient.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. And what about the `capabilities` array in the `getblocktemplate` request parameters? What's that used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `capabilities` array is used to list the client-side supported features, such as 'longpoll', 'coinbasetxn', 'coinbasevalue', 'proposal', 'erverlist', and 'workid'. This allows the client to inform the server of its capabilities and negotiate the block template accordingly.\n\n**User:**\nLast question: what information is included in the result of the `getblocktemplate` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `getblocktemplate` command includes the block version, the hash of the current highest block, the hash of the final sapling root, and an array of non-coinbase transactions that should be included in the next block. Each transaction in the array includes its data, hash, dependencies, and fee.",
