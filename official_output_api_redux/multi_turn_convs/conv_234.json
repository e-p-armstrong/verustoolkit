    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the `submitblock` command in Verus. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `submitblock` command is used to attempt to submit a new block to the Verus network. It takes two arguments: the hex-encoded block data to submit, and an optional object of parameters. Do you have any other questions about `submitblock`?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What are the possible results of submitting a block using the `submitblock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe possible results of submitting a block using the `submitblock` command are:\n* \"duplicate\" - node already has a valid copy of the block\n* \"duplicate-invalid\" - node already has the block, but it is invalid\n* \"duplicate-inconclusive\" - node already has the block but has not validated it\n* \"inconclusive\" - node has not validated the block, it may not be on the node's current best chain\n* \"rejected\" - block was rejected as invalid\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nI see. How do I include a workid with my block submission using the `submitblock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can include a workid with your block submission by adding a \"workid\" parameter to the optional json parameters object. For example:\n```\nverus submitblock \"hexdata\" '{\"workid\": \"id\"}'\n```\nDoes that help?\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What happens if I submit a block that is already known to the node using the `submitblock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you submit a block that is already known to the node, the result will be \"duplicate\", \"duplicate-invalid\", or \"duplicate-inconclusive\", depending on the validity of the block.",
