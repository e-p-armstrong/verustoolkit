    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been experimenting with the `getnetworksolps` command in Verus, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getnetworksolps` command estimates the network solutions per second based on the last n blocks. It can be used to gauge the current or past network speed. Do you have any specific questions about how to use it or what it does?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How do I use the `getnetworksolps` command to estimate the network speed at a specific block height?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getnetworksolps` command to estimate the network speed at a specific block height by passing the block height as the second argument. For example: `verus getnetworksolps 120 1000` would estimate the network speed at block height 1000. Do you have any more questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the default number of blocks used by the `getnetworksolps` command to estimate the network speed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default number of blocks used by the `getnetworksolps` command to estimate the network speed is 120. If you don't specify a number, it will use 120 blocks to make the estimate.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does passing -1 as the first argument to the `getnetworksolps` command do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPassing -1 as the first argument to the `getnetworksolps` command specifies that the command should use blocks over the difficulty averaging window to estimate the network speed. This can give you a different perspective on the network speed, depending on what you're trying to measure.",
