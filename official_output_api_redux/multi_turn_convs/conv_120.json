    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been going through some documentation on Verus upgrades, and I came across the \"activationheight\" property in the upgrade object. What does that represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"activationheight\" property in the upgrade object represents the block height at which the upgrade will be activated. So, it's essentially the point at which the upgrade will take effect on the network.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been looking at the \"consensus\" object, and I'm a bit unclear on the difference between the \"chaintip\" and \"nextblock\" properties. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"chaintip\" property in the \"consensus\" object represents the branch ID used to validate the current chain tip, while the \"nextblock\" property represents the branch ID that the next block will be validated under. This allows the network to transition smoothly between different consensus rules.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I understand that now. One more thing - what kind of information can be found in the \"info\" property of an upgrade object?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"info\" property of an upgrade object contains additional information about the upgrade, which can be used to provide more context or details about the upgrade. It's a way to provide extra information about the upgrade, beyond the technical details.",
