    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how to use some of the commands in Verus, and I came across the `coinsupply` command. What is the purpose of the `coinsupply` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `coinsupply` command is used to retrieve coin supply information at a given block height in the Verus blockchain. If no height is specified, it defaults to the current block height. Would you like to know more about what information it returns?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that would be great! What information is returned by the `coinsupply` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `coinsupply` command returns a JSON object containing the following information:\n\n1. `result`: A string indicating whether the request was successful.\n2. `coin`: The currency symbol of the native coin of the blockchain (e.g., \"VRSC\").\n3. `height`: The block height of the coin supply data.\n4. `supply`: The transparent coin supply as a float value.\n5. `zfunds`: The shielded coin supply (in zaddrs) as a float value.\n6. `total`: The total coin supply, which is the sum of `supply` and `zfunds`.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the `coinsupply` command!\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! How can I use the `coinsupply` command to retrieve coin supply information at a specific block height?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `coinsupply` command with a block height argument, like this:\n```\nverus coinsupply <height>\n```\nReplace `<height>` with the desired block height. For example:\n```\nverus coinsupply 420\n```\nThis will return the coin supply information at block height 420. Just replace 420 with the block height you're interested in!",
