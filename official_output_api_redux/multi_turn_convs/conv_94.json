    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've been looking at the blockchain definition in Verus, and I'm not entirely sure what the \"nodes\" field is used for. Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"nodes\" field in a Verus blockchain definition is an optional array of objects that specifies up to 8 nodes that can be used to connect to the blockchain. Each node object can contain two optional fields: \"nodeidentity\" and \"paymentaddress\". \"nodeidentity\" is a string that specifies the internet, TOR, or other supported address for the node, and \"paymentaddress\" is an integer that specifies the rewards payment address for the node.\n\nIn essence, this field allows you to define a list of nodes that can be used to connect to the blockchain, making it easier for users to access and interact with the blockchain. Does that clarify things for you?",
