    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `z_mergetoaddress` command, but I'm not sure what happens to the UTXOs selected for merging. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using the `z_mergetoaddress` command, the UTXOs selected for merging will be locked. If there is an error during the merging process, the UTXOs will be unlocked. You can use the `listlockunspent` RPC call to return a list of locked UTXOs. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I've got another question about `z_mergetoaddress`. How can I limit the number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging when using this command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can limit the number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging by setting the `transparent_limit` and `shielded_limit` parameters. If the `transparent_limit` parameter is set to zero, the number of UTXOs will be limited based on the size of the transaction, or by the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option if Overwinter is not yet active. Does that answer your question?",
