    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand the `invalidateblock` command in Verus. Can you explain what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `invalidateblock` command permanently marks a block as invalid, as if it violated a consensus rule. This means that the block will no longer be considered valid by the Verus network. It's a pretty powerful command, so be careful when using it!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What argument is required to use the `invalidateblock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `invalidateblock` command requires a single argument, which is the hash of the block to be marked as invalid. You'll need to provide the actual hash of the block you want to invalidate.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I understand. How can I actually use the `invalidateblock` command to mark a block as invalid in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `invalidateblock` command in Verus by running the following command in the Verus CLI: `verus invalidateblock \"blockhash\"`. Replace `\"blockhash\"` with the actual hash of the block you want to mark as invalid. Alternatively, you can use the Verus JSON-RPC API to send a request to `http://127.0.0.1:27486/` with the method `invalidateblock` and the parameter `[\"blockhash\"]`. Make sure to replace `\"blockhash\"` with the actual block hash you want to invalidate.",
