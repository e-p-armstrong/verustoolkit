    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `estimatepriority` command in Verus. Can you help me out? What is the purpose of this command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `estimatepriority` command is used to estimate the approximate priority a zero-fee transaction needs to begin confirmation within a specified number of blocks. It's a useful tool for understanding the priority requirements for zero-fee transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, how do I actually use the `estimatepriority` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo use the `estimatepriority` command, you need to specify the number of blocks (`nblocks`) as an argument. The command will then return an estimated priority value as a result. It's a pretty straightforward process.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What does the result of the `estimatepriority` command actually represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `estimatepriority` command represents the estimated priority value that a zero-fee transaction needs to begin confirmation within the specified number of blocks. If not enough transactions and blocks have been observed to make an estimate, the command returns -1.0.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. Can you provide an example of how to use the `estimatepriority` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nHere is an example of how to use the `estimatepriority` command: `verus estimatepriority 6`. This command estimates the approximate priority a zero-fee transaction needs to begin confirmation within 6 blocks. Just replace the `6` with the number of blocks you're interested in, and you're good to go!",
