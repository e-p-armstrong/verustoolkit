    "What is the result of the `fundrawtransaction` command?",
    "The result of the `fundrawtransaction` command is a JSON object containing three properties: \"hex\" (the resulting raw transaction as a hex-encoded string), \"fee\" (the fee added to the transaction), and \"changepos\" (the position of the added change output, or -1 if no change output was added).",
