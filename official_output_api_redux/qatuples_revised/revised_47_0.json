    "The `setgenerate` command is used to turn on or off the generation of blocks in Verus, which includes both mining and minting (or staking). It allows you to control the processing power used for generation and to switch between mining and minting.",
    "setgenerate generate ( genproclimit )\n\nSet 'generate' true to turn either mining/generation or minting/staking on and false to turn both off.\nMining is limited to 'genproclimit' processors, -1 is unlimited, setgenerate true with 0 genproclimit turns on staking\nSee the getgenerate call for the current setting.\n\nArguments:\n1. generate     (boolean, required) Set to true to turn on generation, off to turn off.\n2. genproclimit   (numeric, optional) Set processor limit when generation is on. Can be -1 for unlimited, 0 to turn on staking.\n\nExamples:\n\nSet the generation on with a limit of one processor\n> verus setgenerate true 1\n\nTurn minting/staking on\n> verus setgenerate true 0\n\nCheck the setting\n> verus getgenerate\n\nTurn off generation and minting\n> verus setgenerate false\n\nUsing json rpc\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"setgenerate\", \"params\": [true, 1] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
