    "What is the purpose of the \"notarizationprotocol\" field when defining a currency or chain in Verus, and what are the different possible values it can take?",
    "The \"notarizationprotocol\" field determines how a currency or chain is notarized in Verus. It can take three possible values:\n\n1. 1 (PROOF_PBAASMMR): This uses Verus MMR proof and does not require notaries.\n2. 2 (PROOF_CHAINID): This uses the chain ID as the sole notary, and no evidence is required.\n3. 3 (PROOF_ETHNOTARIZATION): This uses Ethereum notarization and PATRICIA TRIE proof.",
