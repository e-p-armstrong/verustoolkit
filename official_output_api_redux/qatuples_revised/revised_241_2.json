    "What does the `options` argument do in the `definecurrency` command?",
    "The `options` argument is an integer that specifies various properties of the currency being defined. It is a bitwise OR of several flags, including:\n\n* `FRACTIONAL` (1): indicates that the currency is fractional\n* `IDRESTRICTED` (2): restricts the currency to a specific identity\n* `IDSTAKING` (4): enables staking for the identity\n* `IDREFERRALS` (8): enables referrals for the identity\n* `IDREFERRALSREQUIRED` (0x10): requires referrals for the identity\n* `TOKEN` (0x20): indicates that the currency is a token\n* `RESERVED` (0x40): reserves the currency for future use\n* `IS_PBAAS_CHAIN` (0x100): indicates that the currency is a PBaaS chain",
