    "What is the difference between `currencies` and `currencynames` in a currency definition in Verus?",
    "In a currency definition in Verus, `currencies` is an array of currencies that can be converted to this currency at launch or make up a liquidity basket, while `currencynames` is an object mapping i-addresses to fully qualified names of all sub-currencies.\n\nIn other words, `currencies` lists the currencies that can be converted to or are part of a liquidity basket, while `currencynames` provides a mapping of internal i-addresses to human-readable names for all sub-currencies.",
