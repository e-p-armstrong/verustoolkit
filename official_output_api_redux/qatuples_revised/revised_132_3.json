    "How can I use the `addmergedblock` command with the Verus CLI?",
    "You can use the `addmergedblock` command with the Verus CLI by running a command like this:\n```\nverus addmergedblock \"hexdata\" '{\"currencyid\" : \"hexstring\", \"rpchost\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"rpcport\" : portnum}'\n```\nReplace \"hexdata\" with the hex-encoded block data, and \"hexstring\" with the currency ID. Also, replace \"127.0.0.1\" and \"portnum\" with the actual RPC host and port.",
    "addmergedblock \"hexdata\" ( \"jsonparametersobject\" )\n\nAdds a fully prepared block and its header to the current merge mining queue of this daemon.\nParameters determine the action to take if adding this block would exceed the available merge mining slots.\nDefault action to take if adding would exceed available space is to replace the choice with the least ROI if this block provides more.\n\nArguments\n1. \"hexdata\"           (string, required) the hex-encoded, complete, unsolved block data to add. nTime, and nSolution are replaced.\n2. \"name\"            (string, required) chain name symbol\n3. \"rpchost\"           (string, required) host address for RPC connection\n4. \"rpcport\"           (int,  required) port address for RPC connection\n5. \"userpass\"          (string, required) credentials for login to RPC\n\nResult:\n\"deserialize-invalid\" - block could not be deserialized and was rejected as invalid\n\"blocksfull\"     - block did not exceed others in estimated ROI, and there was no room for an additional merge mined block\n{\"nextblocktime\": n} - block has invalid time and must be remade with time returned\n\nExamples:\n> verus addmergedblock \"hexdata\" '{\"currencyid\" : \"hexstring\", \"rpchost\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"rpcport\" : portnum}'\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"addmergedblock\", \"params\": [\"hexdata\" '{\"currencyid\" : \"hexstring\", \"rpchost\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"rpcport\" : portnum, \"estimatedroi\" : (verusreward/hashrate)}'] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
