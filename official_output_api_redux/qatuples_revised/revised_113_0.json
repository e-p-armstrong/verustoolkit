    "What is the purpose of the `zcrawjoinsplit` command in Verus?",
    "The `zcrawjoinsplit` command is used to splice a joinsplit into a raw transaction. It takes inputs and outputs as JSON objects, where inputs are unilaterally confidential and outputs are confidential between the sender and receiver.",
    "zcrawjoinsplit rawtx inputs outputs vpub_old vpub_new\n inputs: a JSON object mapping {note: zcsecretkey, ...}\n outputs: a JSON object mapping {zcaddr: value, ...}\n\nDEPRECATED. Splices a joinsplit into rawtx. Inputs are unilaterally confidential.\nOutputs are confidential between sender/receiver. The vpub_old and\nvpub_new values are globally public and move transparent value into\nor out of the confidential value store, respectively.\n\nNote: The caller is responsible for delivering the output enc1 and\nenc2 to the appropriate recipients, as well as signing rawtxout and\nensuring it is mined. (A future RPC call will deliver the confidential\npayments in-band on the blockchain.)\n\nOutput: {\n \"encryptednote1\": enc1,\n \"encryptednote2\": enc2,\n \"rawtxn\": rawtxout\n}",
