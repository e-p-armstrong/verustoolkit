    "How do I use the `getidentitycontent` command to retrieve content from a specific identity?",
    "To use the `getidentitycontent` command, you need to provide the identity's name followed by \"@\" or its i-address as a string. You can also specify optional parameters such as `heightstart` and `heightend` to limit the content retrieval to a specific height range. Additionally, you can include `txproofs` to return proof of the identity, `txproofheight` to specify the height from which to generate the proof, `vdxfkey` for a more selective search, and `keepdeleted` to return deleted items as well.",
