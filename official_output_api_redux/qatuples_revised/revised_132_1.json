    "What happens if adding a block would exceed the available merge mining slots?",
    "If adding a block would exceed the available merge mining slots, the default action is to replace the block with the least ROI (Return on Investment) if the new block provides more ROI. This ensures that the most profitable blocks are prioritized in the merge mining process.",
