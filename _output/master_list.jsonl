{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was trying to install the Verus software and my antivirus kept flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question! Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about it. Don't worry, it's a common issue with mining software. Do you have any other questions about this or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I was looking at the sample chain definition in the Verus software and I'm not entirely sure what it's for.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe sample chain definition provided is an example of how to define a chain using the Verus software. It shows the format and required information to create a new chain, including the chain name, eras, notarization reward, billing period, and node addresses. It's meant to be a guide to help you create your own chain.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, how do I connect to a defined chain once it's created?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOnce a chain is created, you can connect to it using the command `./komodod -chain=CHAINNAME`, where CHAINNAME is the name of the chain you want to connect to. Simple as that!\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens when you connect to a chain for the first time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you connect to a chain for the first time, a local config file is created, and you won't need to run VRSCTEST to connect again. However, you will still need VRSCTEST to merge mine. The config file will be stored locally, so you can easily connect to the chain again in the future.\n\n**User:**\nWhere are the config files for PBaaS chains stored?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe config files for PBaaS chains are stored in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME` directory, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the relationship between IDs and currencies in Verus. What's the connection between the two?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, an ID of a specific name is required to create a currency of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. Does that clarify the connection between IDs and currencies in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! Now I'm wondering, how can I define a currency in Verus, and what are the requirements for launching it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a currency in Verus, you can use the `definecurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nTo launch a currency, the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command. The currency launch will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! Now, how can I convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency, such as GOLD, in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency, such as GOLD, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.

The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level. First, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:  ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' ``` of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches. After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:  ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]' ``` that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back. Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

This means that you use the software at your own risk, and the authors or copyright holders of the Verus software are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from its use.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What is the liability of the authors or copyright holders of the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders of the Verus software shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. This means that they are not responsible for any losses or damages you may incur while using the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that some antivirus software might flag the Verus software as malicious. Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's correct. Avast and Kaspersky might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit the user's PC. This is a false positive, and more information about it can be found in the provided resources. It's not actually malicious, but rather a precautionary measure taken by the antivirus software.\n\n**User:**\nWhat features does the Verus public testnet offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. This allows developers to test and experiment with the Verus protocol in a safe and controlled environment.\n\n**User:**\nHow does the Verus protocol handle conversions between currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus protocol enables fully decentralized conversions between currencies, with a standard protocol fee of 0.01% that goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network. The protocol calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread. This means that conversions are fast, secure, and with minimal fees.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the current release of the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe current release of the Verus software is a test release intended for testing and development with public blockchains as a service (PBaaS).

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about Verus Fee Pooling technology. What is it, and how does it address concerns about blockchain security?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Fee Pooling technology is a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model that strengthens blockchain security. It works by gathering fees from transactions in a block, adding them to a common pool, and allowing the current block miner or staker to take up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool. This model addresses concerns about blockchain security by preserving the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also heard about Verus Vault technology. What benefits does it provide in terms of protecting funds and private keys?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault technology provides an additional layer of protection for funds and private keys by enabling advanced time locking capabilities. This allows for the creation of theft-resistant workflows for identity management, providing peace of mind in knowing that funds are protected from lost or stolen private keys.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the main benefit of using Verus Vault for identity management?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main benefit of using Verus Vault for identity management is that it provides a theft-resistant workflow, enabling users to manage their identities in a secure and protected manner.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nHi! I've been trying to understand the Verusd coindaemon. Can you tell me what options are available to it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe options available to the Verusd coindaemon can be issued from the command line or stored in the `VRSC.conf` file. The `VRSC.conf` file is loaded on daemon startup and provides the standard configuration. Options supplied at the command line will override any conflicting settings in the `VRSC.conf` file. Do you have any other questions about the coindaemon?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! Is there a way to get a help message for the Verus Daemon?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get a help message for the Verus Daemon by using the `-?` option. For example, `verusd -?` will display the help message. Would you like to know more about any specific option?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's all for now. But I do have another question. How can I receive and display P2P network alerts?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can receive and display P2P network alerts by using the `-alerts` option. This option is enabled by default, but you can disable it by setting it to 0. Alerts can be important for staying informed about the network, so be careful when disabling them!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What does the `-bootstrap` option do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-bootstrap` option removes previous chain data (if present), downloads, and extracts the bootstrap archive.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been looking into the Verus RPC API, and I was wondering about the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` RPC API in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` RPC API enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This allows wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.\n\n**User:**\nThat's fascinating. I'd also like to know more about Verus Vault technology. What is it, and how does it extend the capabilities of VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault technology is an advanced time lock capability that extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities. It allows for easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, and simplifying estate planning, all while enabling self-sovereign management of funds, identity, and estate planning.\n\n**User:**\nAnother area I'm interested in is the revenue models for mining and staking. How does Verus Fee Pooling technology address concerns about blockchain security and mining/staking fee and revenue models?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Fee Pooling technology addresses concerns about blockchain security and mining/staking fee and revenue models by preserving the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time. In this model, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block, added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to download Verus, but I want to make sure it's legitimate. How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands with the `verus` CLI tool to verify the signature. For example:\n\n**Verifying file directly**\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AQm0EAABQR8S/gEslZAXyvOmsbZ1iHKTDXFlABnJNPMCUXXNzwd57xW3IHjcumslSyi+JKkkhbWX6eXxkFcMICW8wQRE7i8k /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.1-1-amd64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.1-1-amd64.tar.gz\n```\n\n**Verifying using a checksum**\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" ATbAEAABQR/kpmoY0p915MY2NhXkl7O/wiDt/cjVfBKuvd0CdV5a4AFX5CnctBuOMEwCyiowyzYNPDanzSzE277ZDbMNH5We 95e70c52caeafffb0c9715aa28588068c9178c89fca2f60313074db052022a33\n```\n\nThe result will be `true` if the signature is valid. Do you have any more questions about verifying downloads or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nAnother thing I wanted to know was how the \"sendcurrency\" API works on the Verus Testnet.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn the Verus Testnet, the \"sendcurrency\" API is enhanced with new multi-currency parameters. The first parameter, \"currency\":\"currencyname\", specifies the source currency of the send. The next parameter, \"convertto\":\"currencyname\", allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source. Do you have any further questions about the \"sendcurrency\" API or the Verus Testnet?\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about the anti-front running system in the Verus Testnet. What's the benefit of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe anti-front running system ensures that conversions are always at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions, and there is no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. This means that all transactions in an aggregation of import blocks are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other. This system prevents front-running and ensures fairness in currency conversions.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to use Verus to get a list of currencies that have markets for a specific pair of currencies. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` command to retrieve a list of currencies that have markets for a specific pair of currencies. For example, to get all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold, you would run:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any other questions about using `getcurrencyconverters` or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually, I do. What's the purpose of the `sendcurrency` API in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is used to send and convert funds between different currencies and chains. It can be used to send funds from one address to another, convert funds from one currency to another, and even send funds cross-chain. Would you like to know more about how to use `sendcurrency`?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that would be great. How can I send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to the address \"alice@\". Do you have any other questions about using `sendcurrency`?\n\n**User:**\nOne more, how can I convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST to the fractional basket currency VRSC-BTC using the funding source from the IDs. Do you have any more questions about `sendcurrency` or Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I'm interested in learning more about defining currencies in Verus. What are some of the options available when defining a currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen defining a currency in Verus, some options available include:\n1. OPTION_FRACTIONAL: Allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set.\n2. OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE: If set, IDs may only be created by the controlling ID.\n3. OPTION_ID_STAKING: If set, all IDs on the chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking.\n4. OPTION_ID_REFERRALS: If set, this chain supports referrals.\n5. OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED: If set, this chain requires referrals.\n6.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about VerusIDs. What are the three main features of VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe three main features of VerusIDs are: revocable, recoverable, and private. Each ID includes a revocation authority that can revoke the identity, effectively freezing all of its funds until it is recovered. Each ID also includes a separate recovery authority that can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state. Finally, each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses and a content map of key-value hashes that can be used to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What was the goal of VerusHash 2.0, and how did it achieve it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe goal of VerusHash 2.0 was to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs on the Verus network. It achieved this goal by developing an algorithm that explicitly equalized FPGAs and modern CPUs, keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What are some key features of VerusIDs, and how do they contribute to the security and flexibility of digital identities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs have three key features: revocability, recoverability, and privacy. These features contribute to the security and flexibility of digital identities by allowing for the revocation of an identity in case of key theft, recovery of an identity through redefining its primary state, and the use of zero-knowledge private addresses and content maps for private yet selectively provable claims and attestations.\n\n**User:**\nHow does VerusHash 2.0 algorithm contribute to the Verus network, and what are the goals of its development?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs on the Verus network. Its goal is to prevent FPGAs from dominating CPUs in terms of performance, thereby keeping the cost of FPGA performance under 2x that of CPU performance.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the main difference between VerusHash 2.0 and VerusHash 2.1, and how does it affect the balance between FPGAs and CPUs on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main difference between VerusHash 2.0 and VerusHash 2.1 is an adjustment to the equalization technology in VerusHash 2.1, which is expected to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. This adjustment aims to promote a more balanced performance between FPGAs and CPUs on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of privacy features do VerusIDs provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs provide private zero-knowledge addresses, which can be used for various purposes such as messaging, financial transactions, or voting. They also contain a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and identity policies to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, and selectively provable components of a strong identity.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of VerusHash 2.1, and how does it differ from VerusHash 2.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology of VerusHash 2.0, aiming to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does it mean for a VerusID to be revocable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is revocable, meaning that it includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity itself.

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# Disclaimer", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in the Verus protocol. What are the key features of the Verus protocol that integrate DeFi and cross-currency liquidity with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe key features of the Verus protocol include DeFi and cross-currency liquidity integration with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, including a 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm. This set of capabilities takes DeFi further than any project in crypto today.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds impressive. What capabilities does the Verus protocol integrate to take DeFi further than any project in crypto today?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus protocol integrates DeFi and cross-currency liquidity with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, a 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm. This integration allows for a wide range of advanced capabilities that set Verus apart.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the main benefit of Verus's integrated DeFi and cross-currency liquidity platform?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus's integrated DeFi and cross-currency liquidity platform allows for a decentralized, rent-free, and highly capable platform that takes DeFi further than any other project in crypto today. This platform integrates blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, with a 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm, enabling a wide range of advanced capabilities.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the `getcurrencyconverters` RPC API. What is its purpose, and how does it enable wallets or applications to query the blockchain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` RPC API (final name to be determined at mainnet) enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This allows wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is Verus Vault technology, and how does it extend the capabilities of VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault technology extends the capabilities of VerusIDs by adding an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds. This enables easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, and simplifying estate planning. With Verus Vault technology, users can manage their funds, identity, and estate planning in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind that they are protected from lost or stolen private keys.", "qa_tuples": [["What are the key features of the Verus protocol that integrate DeFi and cross-currency liquidity with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP?", "The key features of the Verus protocol include DeFi and cross-currency liquidity integration with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, including a 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the options available when defining a currency in Verus. Can you walk me through those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen defining a currency in Verus, there are several options available, which can be combined to customize the behavior of the currency. These options include:\n1. `OPTION_FRACTIONAL`: Allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set.\n2. `OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE`: If set, IDs may only be created by a controlling ID.\n3. `OPTION_ID_STAKING`: If set, all IDs on the chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking.\n4. `OPTION_ID_REFERRALS`: If set, this chain supports referrals.\n5. `OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED`: If set, this chain requires referrals.\n6. `OPTION_TOKEN`: If set, this is a token, not a native currency.\n7. `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY`: For PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency.\n8. `OPTION_GATEWAY`: If set, this routes external currencies.\n9. `OPTION_PBAAS`: If set, this is a PBaaS chain definition.\n10. `OPTION_PBAAS_CONVERTER`: If set, this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices.\n\nThese options can be combined using bitwise operations to customize the behavior of the currency. Do you have any further questions about these options?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps. What are currency options in Verus, and what do they do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, currency options are used to define the properties of a currency. Here are some of the options and their effects:\n\n* `OPTION_FRACTIONAL`: Allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set.\n* `OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE`: If set, IDs may only be created by the controlling ID.\n* `OPTION_ID_STAKING`: If set, all IDs on the chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking.\n* `OPTION_ID_REFERRALS`: If set, this chain supports referrals.\n* `OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED`: If set, this chain requires referrals.\n* `OPTION_TOKEN`: If set, this is a token, not a native currency.\n* `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY`: For PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to a single currency.\n* `OPTION_GATEWAY`: If set, this routes external currencies.\n* `OPTION_PBAAS`: This is a PBaaS chain definition.\n* `OPTION_PBAAS_CONVERTER`: This means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices.\n\nThese options can be combined to define the properties of a currency in Verus. Do you have any more questions about these options?\n\n**User:**\nHow do I send VRSCTEST to another user, alice@, and convert it to a new coin called NEWCOIN using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo send VRSCTEST to another user, alice@, and convert it to a new coin called NEWCOIN, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 units of VRSCTEST to alice@ and converts it to NEWCOIN. If the conversion is not possible, the original amount will be refunded to alice@. Do you have any other questions about this command or about Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nHow do I convert VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"exportto\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\",\"via\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 units of VRSCTEST to PBaaSChain units and sends them to the specified address on the PBaaSChain. Do you have any questions about this command or about cross-chain conversions in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I send VRSCTEST cross-chain to a PBaaSChain using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST cross-chain to a PBaaSChain using the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\",\"amount\":10, \"exportto\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\"}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 units of VRSCTEST to the specified address on the PBaaSChain.

Do you have any questions about this command or about cross-chain conversions in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the OPTION_FRACTIONAL option when defining a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_FRACTIONAL option allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set.

Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm interested in learning more about PBaaS development. Where can I stay connected to learn more and participate in the launch of the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can stay connected and participate in the launch of the testnet by joining the #pbaas-development channel. This is where you'll find the latest updates and discussions on PBaaS development. We're excited to have you on board!\n\n**User:**\nThanks for that! I've been playing around with the testnet, but I think I messed something up. How can I reset my testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo problem! To reset your testnet, make sure Verus is closed and no testnet daemon is running. Then, delete the following directories:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`\n* On Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`\n* On Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`\n\nAfter deleting the directories, restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native). This should reset your testnet to a clean state. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent using the `registernamecommitment` command. Can you show me an example of how to do this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `registernamecommitment` command now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've got a question about the download process. What's the purpose of the `txt` file included with each Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `txt` file included with each Verus download contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. This file is used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded archive. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. How do I actually verify the signature of a downloaded Verus archive using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the signature of a downloaded Verus archive, you can use the `verifyfile` command with the following format:\n\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Testing@\" <signature> <file_path>\n```\n\nReplace `<signature>` with the signature from the `txt` file, and `<file_path>` with the path to the downloaded archive.

How can tokens be controlled on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTokens on the Verus network can be controlled by the blockchain, or they can be partially blockchain controlled and centralized.

Mainnet approved testnet release is not yet available# Verus Testnet PBaaS Multi-currency TokensThe testnet supports a completely new capability of token definitions and token launches (Kickstarter/Gofundme style, ICO, ITO, IPO, etc.). These tokens can be sent through the Verus protocol using the new 'sendcurrency' API, which works for all currencies in the Verus network. Tokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies as well. Token launches can accept multiple other coins or tokens for conversion to the new token with payment to the token ID. Each token can have a different conversion price for pre-launch participation as well as minimums and maximums of participation. If minimums are not met by the currency's startblock, all participation will be refunded, less a minimal transfer/network fee, which was already allocated to miners/stakers.Tokens can be controlled by the blockchain and used for many purposes, including payment models, tickets, point systems, etc., or they can be partially blockchain controlled, centralized tokens, with currencies that are mintable at any time by the ID behind them. The controlling ID can also receive receive aggregated outgoing transactions to external systems that both burn coins and pass account data in the process. This will allow applications to control currency supplies on the public network, whether these applications are external, decentralized networks or centralized custodial systems, in many typical use cases of tokens, including club coins, game tokens, token launches, etc., no programming is required.## Defining a Currency", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

This update is the latest for the upgraded Verus mainnet.# Notable Changes - Fix accretion of coinbases in mempool# Verus ID VerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. VerusIDs provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, VerusID provides:### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to send multiple transactions at once using the `sendmany` command. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendmany` command allows you to send multiple transactions at once. The syntax is as follows:\n```\nverus sendmany \"fromaccount\" {\"address\":amount,...} ( minconf \"comment\" [\"address\",...] )\n```\nFor example:\n```\nverus sendmany \"\" {\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\":0.01, \"anotheraddress\":0.02} 6 \"donation\" [\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\", \"anotheraddress\"]\n```\nThis will send 0.01 VRSC to `RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV` and 0.02 VRSC to `anotheraddress`, with a minimum of 6 confirmations.

Do you have any questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's clear. But what's the purpose of the `minconf` argument in the `sendfrom` and `sendmany` commands?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `minconf` argument specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for the transaction to be considered valid. This means that the transaction will only be sent if the account has a balance confirmed at least `minconf` times.

Can you tell me, what's the purpose of this interface?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of this PHP staking interface is to help users stake on their permanently running machine using Verus CLI, instead of running the Agama GUI wallet. It provides features such as automatic shielding and unshielding of coinbase, automatic tracking of total coins generated, and optional email notifications. This makes it easier to manage your staking process and keep track of your rewards.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind?\n\n**User:**\nI've been wondering about using locked VerusIDs. What are the benefits of using a locked VerusID, and how does it protect against the 5-dollar wrench attack?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA locked VerusID provides an additional layer of security and protection against unauthorized access or theft. Even if someone gains access to the primary keys, they will need to wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This allows the revocation and recovery authority identities to detect and respond to unauthorized unlocks, effectively mitigating the 5-dollar wrench attack.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really useful. What is Verus Vault, and what kind of protection does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a decentralized solution that provides a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery for your IDs, NFTs, and assets. It offers time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance, and allows you to protect and recover your funds, preserving your blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, without the need for a bank.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been having some issues with my testnet. How do I reset my testnet on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your testnet on Verus, you need to:\n\n1. Close Verus and ensure no testnet daemon is running.\n2. Delete the following directories:\n\t* On Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`\n\t* On Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`\n\t* On Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` (or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`)\n3. Restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native).\n\n**User:**\nThanks for that. I also need to export an ID to a PBaaS chain. How do I export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the command line and Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nThis command exports the ID \"IDNAME@\" to the \"PBaaSChainName\" chain.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. How do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on Verus, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\n2. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n3.

That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.## Testnet Reset To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest` - Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest` - Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain  ```  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'  ```## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet) Create transaction, get raw transaction data:  ```  verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'  verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>  ``` Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:  ```  verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>  ``` After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:  ```  verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>  ```", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}
{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! What else would you like to know about Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I have a few more questions. What is the purpose of an unlock delay in VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe unlock delay in VerusIDs is designed to prevent unauthorized access to a user's ID. It requires a certain amount of time to pass before the ID can be unlocked and used, allowing the user to notice and respond if someone has compromised their keys. The only way to bypass this delay is to revoke and recover the ID, or to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been wondering, how can VerusIDs be used in cryptocurrency transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. This enables users to easily send and receive funds across different blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What capabilities do users have when creating their own tokens or blockchains using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsing Verus, users can create their own token currency or even full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchains that can send and receive from the Verus chain that launched it. These blockchains can be 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant, and can be merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really powerful. What are DeFi liquidity pools in Verus, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, DeFi liquidity pools are pools of assets that can be used to create fractional basket currencies. Any ID owner can define these pools, which can have one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing issues such as miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What happens when a new blockchain is launched on Verus, and how does it relate to DeFi liquidity pools?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a new blockchain is launched on Verus, it can be launched simultaneously with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This bridge converter currency has the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain and runs on the new blockchain. All fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going to external parties.", "qa_tuples": [["What is the purpose of an unlock delay in VerusIDs?", "The unlock delay in VerusIDs is designed to prevent unauthorized access to a user's ID.

The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems. ## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. ## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets - Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols. ## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain.

Now that it has existed on testnet for as long as it has, only those who have either been part of those conversations or experienced it first hand have a real sense for how much better Verus PBaaS is as a solution for cross-chain, DeFi AMMs, decentralized markets, self-sovereign provable recoverable IDs, NFT capabilities, anti-phishing, anti-MEV, scale, or just about any of the challenges people have on crypto platforms today. In fact, as we prepare for activation of this protocol that enables so many new use cases for crypto, not to mention easy onboarding when entrepreneurs discover how to really leverage VerusIDs, PBaaS is so far beyond what people are experiencing on any crypto platform today that it has been easy to dismiss our community as describing the impossible.Once we are live on mainnet and people can actually use all of this themselves, along with every project, chain and currency on the PBaaS network and EVERY ERC20 or ERC721 on Ethereum or even bridged to Ethereum, the truth of Verus will be self-evident, and those who build on Verus will more easily build faster, better, more secure apps and services with the possibility of provable identity + privacy, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts all seamlessly integrated into UIs that do not need business deals, permission, or any centralized infrastructure to connect services and users, enabling everyone to communicate in provable, private, or public ways that always include bidirectional, secure commerce of all kinds.This core capabilities of this release include (lots to learn to understand it all, but here\u2019s a partial list):", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

However, Verus software is not malicious, and these warnings are false positives.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus software download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the authenticity of a Verus software download by checking the included txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation@\". You can also use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the download.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that Verus offers digital signatures. What is the purpose of digital signatures in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer worldwide verifiable, decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft. They enable free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. How do Verus digital signatures differ from those offered by Bitcoin and its derivatives?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus digital signatures offer more advanced capabilities compared to Bitcoin and its derivatives.

Verus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer the first worldwide verifiable, decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft.Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables. It is also the foundation upon which many new applications and additional capabilities can be built.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the Verus blockchain network, and I'm curious about the concept of a fractal model. What is it exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus blockchain network, the fractal model enables an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. This means that there is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the fractal model allows for unlimited scalability and interoperability. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. I've also been experimenting with ID locking on the Verus command line. How do I lock an ID with a time lock using the Verus command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo lock an ID with a time lock using the Verus command line, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter set to the desired unlock block height. Here's an example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nThis will set the ID to be locked until the specified block height. Do you have any questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand that. What's the difference between a time lock and a time delay in Verus ID locking, though?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, a time lock sets the unlock height of the identity, whereas a time delay sets the number of blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. In other words, a time lock specifies when the ID will be unlocked, while a time delay specifies how long the ID will be delayed from being unlocked after the flags are set back to an unlocked state. Does that clarify the difference?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been exploring the Verus API. What's the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It allows you to query for currencies that meet certain liquidity threshold requirements. Do you have any plans to use this API in your project?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. Can you show me how to convert currency using the `sendcurrency` API in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` API to convert currency by specifying the conversion details in the API call. For example, to convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis will convert 10 VRSCTEST to VRSC-BTC using the ID \"bob@\" as the funding source.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI just downloaded Verus and I want to make sure it's legitimate. How can I verify the integrity of a Verus download using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the integrity of a Verus download, you can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n\nHere are some CLI examples:\n\n**Verifying file directly**\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation@\" <signature> <file_path>\n```\n**Verifying using a checksum**\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation@\" <signature> <checksum>\n```\nThe result will be `true` if the signature is valid. Do you have any questions about this process or would you like to know more about the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'd like to know more about those commands. What is the purpose of the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands are used to verify the integrity of a Verus download by checking the signature against a known signer's identity (in this case, \"Verus Coin Foundation@\"). This ensures that the download has not been tampered with or corrupted during transmission. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that makes sense. What's new in the latest software release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA notable change in this release is the check for creation of invalid staking transactions. Do you have any questions about this change or would you like to know more about other features in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I'd like to know more about the Verus Testnet PBaaS Multi-currency Tokens feature. What is it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Testnet PBaaS Multi-currency Tokens feature allows for the definition and launch of new tokens, similar to Kickstarter or ICO-style token launches. These tokens can be sent through the Verus protocol using the new `sendcurrency` API, which works for all currencies in the Verus network. Tokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies, and can have different conversion prices, minimums, and maximums of participation. Does that interest you?\n\n**User:**\nYes, it does! What are some use cases for tokens in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTokens in Verus can be used for various purposes, including payment models, tickets, point systems, and more. They can be controlled by the blockchain or be partially blockchain-controlled, centralized tokens, with currencies that are mintable at any time by the ID behind them. Tokens can also be used for club coins, game tokens, token launches, and other typical use cases, without requiring programming.

Mainnet approved testnet release is not yet available## Notable Changes: - Check for creation of invalid staking transactions# Verus Testnet PBaaS Multi-currency TokensThe testnet supports a completely new capability of token definitions and token launches (Kickstarter/Gofundme style, ICO, ITO, IPO, etc.). These tokens can be sent through the Verus protocol using the new 'sendcurrency' API, which works for all currencies in the Verus network. Tokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies as well. Token launches can accept multiple other coins or tokens for conversion to the new token with payment to the token ID. Each token can have a different conversion price for pre-launch participation as well as minimums and maximums of participation. If minimums are not met by the currency's startblock, all participation will be refunded, less a minimal transfer/network fee, which was already allocated to miners/stakers.Tokens can be controlled by the blockchain and used for many purposes, including payment models, tickets, point systems, etc., or they can be partially blockchain controlled, centralized tokens, with currencies that are mintable at any time by the ID behind them. The controlling ID can also receive receive aggregated outgoing transactions to external systems that both burn coins and pass account data in the process. This will allow applications to control currency supplies on the public network, whether these applications are external, decentralized networks or centralized custodial systems, in many typical use cases of tokens, including club coins, game tokens, token launches, etc., no programming is required.## Defining a Currency", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm a bit worried about something. What happens if I accidentally send funds to a b-address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you accidentally send funds to a b-address, those funds will get locked in the same manner as the original coinbase reward was. However, because they were not sent using a script to lock those coins, they can be retrieved without waiting the full unlock period (typically between 3 and 27 months).\n\n**User:**\nThat's a relief! But how can I retrieve those funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo retrieve funds sent to a b-address, you need to follow a specific procedure. First, you need to determine the TXID of the locked funds. You can do this by obtaining the TXID from the send transaction in Verus-Desktop, looking up the b-address on the explorer, or using the `listunspent` command in Verus Desktop. Once you have the TXID, you can create a raw transaction to retrieve the funds.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I determine the TXID of the locked funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can determine the TXID of the locked funds in three ways: Obtain the TXID from the send transaction in Verus-Desktop, look up the b-address on the explorer and examine the transactions to this address (the youngest transaction is usually the one you need), or in Verus Desktop, go to `Settings` -> `Coin Settings` and make sure `VRSC` is selected in the top right.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the Decentralized Ethereum Bridge. What is it, and what features will it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Decentralized Ethereum Bridge is a gateway that will launch shortly after PBaaS activates on mainnet. It will offer a 1:1 provably mapped currency called \u201cvETH\u201d on the Verus network, also available to all PBaaS chains. The bridge will include a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI, which will enable auto-conversion of fees from Verus to Ethereum when sending cross-chain, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket. Additionally, it will allow permissionless registration of *.vETH IDs, which can be used to create a mapped currency that can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What's the purpose of the liquidity basket in the Decentralized Ethereum Bridge?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe liquidity basket in the Decentralized Ethereum Bridge is a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI. Its purpose is to enable auto-conversion of fees from Verus to Ethereum when sending cross-chain, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket. This ensures that users can seamlessly send assets between the Verus and Ethereum networks without having to worry about conversion rates.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about the Verus Fee Pool. What is it, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Fee Pool is a technology that goes live with PBaaS. It's an on-chain \"fee pool\" where miners and stakers put all fees from cross-chain transactions, DeFi activities, and ID registrations. Miners and stakers then take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward. This system aligns all validator incentives with the health and proper operation of the network, preventing validators from gaming the fee system and creating a circular on-chain economy that can last well beyond block rewards.\n\n**User:**\nWhat problem does the Verus Fee Pool solve, and how does it benefit the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Fee Pool solves the problem of validators gaming the fee system by washing fees-in vs. fees-out or working to reorg/rewind to capture a particularly juicy block reward. By putting all fees into a shared pool and allowing miners and stakers to take a percentage of it, the Verus Fee Pool aligns all validator incentives with the health and proper operation of the network.

The Ethereum bridge will also include a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI, which will have the following functions: Auto conversion of fees from Verus <-> Ethereum when sending cross chain, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket Permissionless ability to register *.vETH IDs, which in addition to the normal sub-ID capability of creating a single token that has control over the ID and can be exported to Ethereum as an automatic ERC721 NFT, can alternately be used to create a \u201cmapped currency\u201d, which can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network by exporting it to the vETH bridge. Only Verus root IDs, and IDs of a gateway can create mapped currencies to a gateway. Decentralized, fair bridge launch. The vETH bridge will launch as other currencies, chains, and gateways can launch, including the bridge converter. When the bridge launches, the contracts will have a surplus of Verus that comes from the fees paid to launch the gateway. In the protocol, that surplus is first used to solve the chicken and egg problem of none of one currency on the other chain. The contracts will cover the Verus fees for all sends from Ethereum before the Bridge converter launches, the liquidity basket becomes active, and the bridge recognizes that launch. Once that happens, the remainder of \u00bd the fees (5000 VRSC) that are left over from the launch and did not go to miners and stakers or pay Verus fees for people sending from Ethereum6) **The Verus Fee Pool and Rewards**: Another technology and solution unique to Verus, the Verus Fee Pool technology goes live with PBaaS. What this means is that as people use the cross-chain, DeFi, or purchase/register IDs on the network, the miner or staker will put all fees into the on-chain \u201cfee pool\u201d, and then take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward. This gives everyone incentive to still prioritize transactions based on fees, while preventing validators from gaming the fee system by washing fees-in vs. fees-out or working to reorg/rewind to capture a particularly juicy block reward.

That would mean cross-chain challenges on mainnet, even though they were fine and fully tested on testnet, could fail and block a bridge until that calculation was made correct and the network upgraded.Because we have the notification oracle technology, we triggered a rip-cord notification selectively for cross-chain that made all nodes listening to the oracle, which we expect to be near 100%, disallow cross-chain operations without affecting same chain operations. That means that all functions on the Verus network, except launching PBaaS chains or Ethereum bridges are fully functional and unhampered in any way at this time. If someone tries to launch a PBaaS chain while this oracle notification is active, all nodes following the oracle will reject such an action without incident until the notification is removed.This release, v1.0.5, properly calculates the aptly named \u201cmagic number\u201d for each chain, in the correct way on the mainnet network, and as long as the notification is set, is fully compatible with current versions on the network.Once everyone has had a chance to upgrade to v1.0.5, the network/community should agree to remove the notification from the oracle and allow PBaaS launches without false rejection of cross-chain challenges. Once we do that, and when someone launches a PBaaS chain that issues such a challenge, the network would become incompatible with Verus versions prior to 1.0.5.From our perspective, we are not aware of urgent efforts to launch a PBaaS chain in the next few days by anyone who cannot wait. All things considered, we believe that we can at least wait until the community discussion on Saturday, and that a strawman deadline would be **Monday, May 29th, at 19:00 UTC** for everyone to have upgraded.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new currency or chain and I'm not sure what the `proofprotocol` option does. Can you explain it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `proofprotocol` option specifies the type of proof protocol used for minting and burning currencies. There are several options:\n\n* `PROOF_PBAASMMR` (1): Verus MMR proof, no notaries required.\n* `PROOF_CHAINID` (2): Chain ID is the sole notary for proof, no evidence required.\n* `PROOF_ETHNOTARIZATION` (3): Ethereum notarization and PATRICIA TRIE proof.\n\nThis option determines how the proof of ownership is handled for your new currency or chain.

Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to learn more about creating chains in Verus. What is the purpose of the `definechain` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `definechain` command is used to define a new chain in Verus. It takes a JSON object as an argument, which specifies the properties of the chain, such as its name, payment address, premine amount, initial contribution, conversion rate, and other settings. It's a crucial step in creating a new chain in Verus. Do you have any other questions about creating chains or the `definechain` command?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I do. What is the minimum amount of notarizations required for a chain to launch in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! The minimum amount of notarizations required for a chain to launch in Verus is 500 blocks worth of notarizations, with a minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization. This ensures that the chain has sufficient support and security before launching.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if the minimum contributions are not met when launching a new chain in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the minimum contributions are not met when launching a new chain in Verus, the chain will fail to start, and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors. This prevents a chain from launching without sufficient support, which is important for the security and stability of the network.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I connect to a defined chain in Verus using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo connect to a defined chain in Verus using the command line, you can use the command `./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN`, where `SOMECOIN` is the name of the chain you want to connect to. On first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine. Do you have any experience with connecting to chains in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, I do. Where are the config files for a PBaaS chain stored in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe config files for a PBaaS chain in Verus are stored in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME` directory, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain. The presence of a correct config file for any chain enables the chain to load as an independent chain. It's an important directory to keep track of when working with PBaaS chains in Verus.

Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization. VRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.The example above defines a chain that emits a premine to the indicated address and also converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.The initial price in reserve at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the early blocks that will come in as reserve currency. All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve. A currency with a reserve of 0.1 or 10% will rise or fall fairly quickly when converted to or from, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit.**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:** ``` ./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN ``` On first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.## Here are a few examples of cross-chain operations using the command line:", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies. Can you explain what they are and how they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi fractional basket currencies are a type of currency that is backed by one or more asset currencies at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. This means that the liquidity pool backing the currency is composed of a combination of different assets, with each asset contributing a certain percentage to the pool.\n\nThe Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about digital signatures using Verus CLI. What is the result of a valid digital signature using Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of a valid digital signature using Verus CLI is actually quite simple: `true`. That's the confirmation you'll get when a digital signature is valid.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! What makes Verus digital signatures different from those offered by Bitcoin and its derivatives?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus digital signatures offer more advanced capabilities than those offered by Bitcoin and its derivatives. They include friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity. Additionally, Verus digital signatures provide full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft. So, it's a much more robust and feature-rich system.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds impressive. What are some potential use cases for Verus digital signatures?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome potential use cases for Verus digital signatures include journalists signing photos, videos, and content to establish a reputation for authenticity and counter deep-fakes; open source projects creating their own identities and digitally signing their binary releases; attestations of one party to the validity of another; physical entry systems; workflow applications; and even new earning opportunities. The possibilities are vast!\n\n**User:**\nI see. What is the foundation upon which Verus digital signatures are built?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus digital signatures are built upon the Verus ID protocol. This foundation provides a robust and secure basis for the digital signatures, allowing them to offer the advanced capabilities and features that set them apart from other digital signature systems.

Verus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer the first worldwide verifiable, decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft.Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables. It is also the foundation upon which many new applications and additional capabilities can be built.For example, using Verus ID signatures, it\u2019s possible for any journalist anywhere to sign photos, videos, and content, establish a reputation for authenticity, and counter the potential for deep-fakes to make the truth harder to find. Open source projects can now create their own identities and digitally sign their binary releases, ensuring that not only can a file be verified by hash as the one downloaded from a particular server, but by signature as the actual file initially signed by the developer or release engineer. Signatures also form the basis for any attestation of one party to the validity of another. In fact, there are so many applications for digital signatures, from things listed already, to physical entry systems, to workflow applications, to new earning opportunities that a full discussion of use cases would overwhelm these release notes.In any case, we are happy to release digital signatures for all, and we hope you enjoy using this new, simple capability, maybe even think of a new use case you\u2019d like to pursue yourself as a business opportunity on the Verus Network!", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a currency with a specific name in Verus. What's required for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency with a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. Do you have any other questions about creating a currency in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! How do I define a currency in Verus, and what are the requirements for launching it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a currency in Verus, you can use the `definecurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nTo launch the currency, the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command. Additionally, there must be 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. The launch process happens as part of the mining process, and mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. Do you have any other questions about defining and launching a currency?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things! How do I convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency, such as GOLD?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency, such as GOLD, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.

I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level. First, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' ``` of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches. After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]' ``` that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back. Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":96, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"conversions\":[0.01, 1.0],\"minpreconversion\":[1000,1000]}' ``` In \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]' ```", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some of the options in Verus. Can you tell me about the OPTION_ID_STAKING option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_ID_STAKING option, with a value of 4, allows all IDs on the chain to stake equally, rather than using value-based staking. This means that every ID has an equal opportunity to participate in the staking process, regardless of the value associated with it.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the OPTION_ID_REFERRALS option? What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_ID_REFERRALS option, with a value of 8, enables support for referrals on the chain. This allows IDs to refer other IDs and enables the referral system on the chain.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what's the difference between OPTION_ID_REFERRALS and OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_ID_REFERRALS option, with a value of 8, enables support for referrals on the chain, while the OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED option, with a value of 16, requires referrals on the chain. In other words, if OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED is set, an ID must have a referral to be valid, whereas with OPTION_ID_REFERRALS, referrals are supported but not required.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these options or Verus in general?", "qa_tuples": [["What is the purpose of the OPTION_ID_STAKING option in Verus?", "The OPTION_ID_STAKING option, with a value of 4, allows all IDs on the chain to stake equally, rather than using value-based staking."], ["What does the OPTION_ID_REFERRALS option do in Verus?", "The OPTION_ID_REFERRALS option, with a value of 8, enables support for referrals on the chain."], ["What is the difference between OPTION_ID_REFERRALS and OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED in Verus?", "The OPTION_ID_REFERRALS option, with a value of 8, enables support for referrals on the chain, while the OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED option, with a value of 16, requires referrals on the chain."]], "rag_context": "  // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4         // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8        // if set, this chain supports referrals OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16    // if set, this chain requires referrals OPTION_TOKEN = 32           // if set, this is a token, not a native currency OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64       // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency OPTION_GATEWAY = 128          // if set, this routes external currencies OPTION_PBAAS = 256           // this is a PBaaS chain definition OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512     // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024  // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048        // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID ```", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the v1.0.7 release. What's the main purpose of it, and why is it highly recommended for Mainnet and mandatory for continued Testnet use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main purpose of the v1.0.7 release is to resolve the issues that led to the pause of PBaaS and DeFi functions on Mainnet. It is highly recommended for Mainnet and mandatory for continued Testnet use to ensure that all functions, including PBaaS and DeFi, are fully operational and to prevent potential issues with cross-chain challenges.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering what changes were made to LP fees and DeFi baskets in the v1.0.7 release.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the v1.0.7 release, LP fees from exiting a DeFi basket's primary currency are now properly burned into those currencies before conversion operations take place.\n\n**User:**\nSo what does the v1.0.7 release mean for PBaaS chain launches and DeFi functions on the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith the v1.0.7 release, all PBaaS functions are now live and fully operational, and all oracle notarizations that were suppressing DeFi, currency sub-ID registrations, and PBaaS chain launches have been lifted from the network.\n\n**User:**\nIs it recommended to launch a PBaaS chain with zero block reward emissions before the network is fully upgraded to v1.0.7 or later?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it is not recommended to launch a PBaaS chain with zero block reward emissions before the network is fully upgraded to v1.0.7 or later, as it may cause issues with cross-chain function. However, if you need to launch such a chain, you can discuss your options with someone in development or support to understand how to plan and mitigate potential issues.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, what's the next step in the development of Verus, according to the release notes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe next step in the development of Verus is the testnet rollout of the Ethereum bridge, followed by its deployment on Mainnet after final testing and review.", "qa_tuples": [["What is the main purpose of the v1.0.7 release, and why is it highly recommended for Mainnet and mandatory for continued Testnet use?", "The main purpose of the v1.0.7 release is to resolve the issues that led to the pause of PBaaS and DeFi functions on Mainnet.

THERE WILL BE A FORKING CHANGE ON TESTNET THAT WILL ACTIVATE TO RE-ENABLE ZERO EMISSION PBAAS CHAIN CHALLENGES TOMORROW, AFTER 19:00 UTCThis release marks the completion and full resolution of the investigations that led to the PBaaS and DeFi pauses. As mentioned, all LP fees from exiting a DeFi basket\u2019s primary currency will now be properly burned into those currencies before conversion operations take place.Shortly before this announcement, all oracle notarizations that were suppressing DeFi, currency sub-ID registrations, and PBaaS chain launches were lifted from the network. That means all PBaaS functions are now live and fully operational!Please note: Though the last mandatory upgrade was v1.0.6, and this is not technically a mandatory upgrade, it does address the known and understood issue only affecting zero reward PBaaS chains that can create issues with cross-chain challenges.Until everyone is known to be on v1.0.7 or later, and we announce that such PBaaS configurations are well supported on the network, we recommend that no one launch a PBaaS chain that has zero block reward emissions. If you choose to do so anyhow, your chain should properly launch, but for about the next month, you may have issues with cross-chain function, unless you understand and plan appropriately. If launching a chain with zero emissions is important to you, and you seriously can\u2019t wait, please discuss with someone in development or support to understand your options. We don\u2019t believe that this is a critical early use case, so we actually don\u2019t expect it to be an issue for anyone.Our next step is the testnet rollout of the Ethereum bridge, and after a few days of that proving out in final testing and review, we will deploy it on mainnet as soon as we believe it is ready for permanent use. Once the Ethereum bridge is live on mainnet, if we do ever need a contract upgrade, we will announce and coordinate with network validators, as each Ethereum contract upgrade will be independently subject to Verus miner and staker approval.Thanks everyone for upgrading as soon as you are able!### Additional Verus Capabilities - On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs - On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming - On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}
{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about the new Verus testnet. What features does it offer, and how can users access it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It allows users to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming. Users can access the testnet through the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, enabling them to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease, and even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. How does a locked VerusID protect against unauthorized access to funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA locked VerusID can be protected from unauthorized access to funds by setting a predetermined unlock time, which must be waited out before the funds can be spent or accessed. Additionally, the revocation and recovery authority identities can always revoke and recover the locked ID, circumventing the lock. This allows for a decentralized solution to protect against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" by assigning a revocation ID to a trusted entity, such as a company that monitors the blockchain, to revoke and recover in case of an unauthorized unlock.\n\n**User:**\nWhat additional features does Verus Vault provide beyond fund protection and recovery?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault provides additional features, such as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance, and protection and recovery of IDs and NFTs.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I access the new Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are some use cases for Verus Vault's time locks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault's time locks can be used for various purposes, including vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This feature provides a secure way to manage and transfer assets over time, ensuring that the intended recipients receive the assets according to the predetermined schedule.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the significance of the new Verus testnet in the context of cryptocurrency platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet marks the beginning of a new age in crypto, offering a wide range of features and capabilities that are not available on other cryptocurrency platforms. It provides a decentralized, multi-chain blockchain platform that enables users to create and manage their own identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains, making it a unique and powerful tool for individuals, businesses, governments, and organizations.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of a locked VerusID, and how can it be recovered in case of unauthorized access?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA locked VerusID provides an additional layer of security against unauthorized access to funds. Even with primary keys, including multisig keys, the unlock process requires a predetermined unlock time, which can be set to a delay, such as 24 hours. This allows the revocation and recovery authority identities to intervene in case of unauthorized access, effectively preventing the 5-dollar wrench attack.

The testnet provides a decentralized, multi-chain blockchain platform that offers unlimited possibilities for users, making it a unique and powerful tool in the crypto space.\n\n**User:**\nHow does Verus Vault protect against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault protects against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" by allowing you to set a unlock delay on your locked IDs. This means that even if someone obtains your primary keys through coercion or other means, they will not be able to spend or access the funds until the unlock time has passed. This provides a decentralized solution to the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" problem, similar to a bank's security measures.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are some of the use cases for Verus Vault's time locks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault's time locks can be used for various purposes, including vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.

All conversions are fully decentralized, require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network, and calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.With no costs beyond public blockchain network fees, Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization of any size to make a fractional reserve currency of its own on an independent, uncluttered blockchain with cross-chain interoperability, and immediately useful for payments and conversion to other currencies from within the Verus wallet. 100% of the 0.01% fees for such conversions go directly to the miners and stakers of the organization's new chain, and those miners and stakers also have the option of merge mining up to 14 other blockchains and coins while mining their own project, improving efficiency, profitability, and shared liquidity for everyone involved.

What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating my own currency in Verus. How can I create a currency of a specific name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. Do you have any further questions about creating a currency in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what are the requirements for launching a new currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a new currency, the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command. Additionally, there must be at least 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at the specified conversion rate in order to launch.

How can I convert VRSCTEST to a new currency (e.g., GOLD) before it launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to a new currency (e.g., GOLD) before it launches, you can issue a command like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.

The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level. First, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:  ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' ``` of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches. After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:  ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]' ``` that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.

If you want to know how profitable it is, you need to know a few important details about your own conditions. 1. What hardware will I use to mine with?  1. CPU - If that is a fairly modern CPU with AES and AVX instructions built in.  This will be true if your processor is produced in 2013 or later. For processors between 2008 and 2012 you need to check the specifications.  Older processors can still mine, but they will not perform well.  2. GPU - It is possible to mine with fairly modern Nvidia GPU's, but since Verushash uses specific functions from the  mentioned AES and AVX instruction sets, they will perform better than old CPUs, but worse than modern CPUs.  3. FPGA - Many of these semi-specialized machines can be reprogrammed to mine VRSC. They don't have the same power per processor as a CPU, but they often have multiple processors running parrallel. The stronger ones can outperform a CPU easily, but need a lot of power to do so. 2. What is my energy price? 3. Do I use existing hardware or do I buy?

Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel. You can use this link as an invite to the Verus Discord: https://discord.gg/gecZsCf- **DeFi and cross-currency liquidity integrated with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm** - This is a massive set of platform capabilities that take DeFi further than any project in crypto today. We will list it here and describe it below. Using it is simple. Understanding the implications of what such a protocol can do when rent free and integrated in a truly decentralized public blockchain is a process of realizations that is likely to be similar to layers of an onion. We will do our best to explain below.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nHi! I heard about the upcoming Mainnet PBaaS Activation and I'm a bit concerned. What is the mandatory upgrade requirement for this event on May 21, 2023?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe mandatory upgrade requirement is to upgrade to v1.0.0 or a later version v1.0.0-x before May 21, 2023, to stay reliably connected to the mainnet. Make sure to upgrade to avoid any issues!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks! I've also been hearing about the Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP). Can you tell me more about it and how it differs from other cross-chain protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP) is a fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology that uses cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state. According to Verus, VIP is superior to and more decentralized than other cross-chain protocols like LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, and Thorchain. VIP offers a more secure and reliable way to interact between different blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds impressive! What new capabilities do VerusIDs gain with the PBaaS upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs gain the capability of VerusID Content Multimaps, which allows for unlimited provable data storage and can be used for various applications such as social networking, voting, oracles, publishing information, provable attestations, ratings, and more. This opens up a lot of possibilities for users!\n\n**User:**\nI see. And what's the significance of VerusID Content Multimaps in the context of AI and human data?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe scalability of PBaaS and VerusID Content Multimaps together make the Verus PBaaS network the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world. This is particularly important given the recent rise of AI.

From what we\u2019ve been able to learn about LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, Thorchain or others, VIP is different from (though closest in some ways to LayerZero), superior to, and more decentralized than all other cross-chain protocols we have seen. We can of course get into any level of discussion on the topic, but expect more descriptions and educational material to follow, now that the protocol was originally conceived of 5 years ago, and has been developed and tested/hardened for years.3) **VerusID Content Multimaps - Unlimited Provable Data for Every VerusID**: With the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs gain a powerful new capability that can be used for social networking, voting, oracles, publishing any information, various forms of provable attestations, ratings, and much, much more. With the scalability of PBaaS and VerusID content multimaps together, the Verus PBaaS network becomes the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world.

THIS UPDATE IS THE LATEST UPDATE FOR THE UPGRADED VERUS MAINNET**# Verus ID VerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. VerusIDs provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, VerusID provides:### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so.

What do the \"weights\", \"conversions\", and \"minpreconversion\" fields represent in a cross-chain or bridged proof definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"weights\" field represents the relative currency weights in a liquidity basket. The \"conversions\" field represents the pre-launch conversion rates for non-fractional currencies. The \"minpreconversion\" field represents the minimum amounts required in pre-conversions for a currency to launch. Does that make sense?

I'm also unsure about the \"currencies\" and \"currencynames\" fields. What's their purpose in a cross-chain or bridged proof definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"currencies\" field is an array of currencies that can be converted to this currency at launch or make up a liquidity basket.

Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm trying to understand more about registering a name commitment in Verus. What's the purpose of registering a name commitment?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRegistering a name commitment in Verus is required as a source for the name to be used when registering an identity. It hides the name itself while ensuring that the miner who mines in the registration cannot front-run the name unless they have also registered a name commitment for the same name or are willing to forfeit the offer of payment for the chance that a commitment made now will allow them to register the name in the future.

What is a Verus ID, and how does it differ from other blockchain ID implementations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA Verus ID is a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides opportunities for identity applications.

Do you have any further questions about Verus IDs?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually. What benefits do Verus IDs offer in terms of sending and receiving funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If the controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. This gives users a high level of flexibility and control over their funds.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen this phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\" mentioned in relation to Verus IDs. What does that mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs are quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses, meaning they are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs themselves are resistant to quantum attacks. Additionally, a quantum secure signature scheme is being integrated, which will allow for retroactive quantum resistance of funds sent to an ID when changed. This is an important feature, as quantum computers have the potential to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets.\n\n**User:**\nHow do Verus IDs enable decentralization and self-sovereignty?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs are fully decentralized, allowing anyone to create one without permission. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers, giving users complete, self-sovereign control over their identity. This means that users have full control over their digital identity, data, and assets, without needing to rely on a central authority.\n\n**User:**\nWhat features do Verus IDs have in terms of revocation and recovery?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs are revocable and recoverable. Each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and can revoke the identity, effectively freezing its funds.

Specifically, Verus ID provides:### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network Verus IDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.- **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the Verus testnet. What is it, and what sets it apart from other cryptocurrency platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers unlimited identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible through the Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets. What sets it apart is its unique capabilities, such as self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable identities, staking-capable time locking and theft prevention, and the ability to create decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming. Would you like to know more about Verus or its features?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes! What is VerusID, and what features does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusID is a protocol that enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. This means that users have full control over their identities and funds, and can revoke or recover them if needed. VerusID offers a high level of security and control for users. Do you have any further questions about VerusID or Verus?\n\n**User:**\nAnother feature I'm curious about is Verus Vault. What is it, and how does it prevent theft?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that enables staking-capable time locking and theft prevention. It allows users to lock their identities, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. The user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice if someone tries to compromise their keys and unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. This provides an additional layer of security and protection against theft.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. What are some potential use cases for Verus' unique features, such as Verus Vault and VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome potential use cases for Verus' unique features include inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, and identity theft protection. The 5-dollar wrench attack, where a thief uses physical force to gain access to a user's keys, can also be prevented using Verus Vault. Additionally, VerusID and Verus Vault can be used to create a virtually theft-proof workflow, providing a high level of security and control for users. These features can be used to create innovative solutions for various industries and use cases.

There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today\u2019s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID - Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. ## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault) - Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user\u2019s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems. ## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from t", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI downloaded Verus, but I'm not sure if it's legitimate. How can I verify the integrity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the integrity of a Verus download, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. This text file contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the signature. The `verifyfile` command takes the signer's identity, signature, and file path as arguments, while the `verifyhash` command takes the signer's identity, signature, and file checksum as arguments. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, but what is the purpose of the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI are used to verify the integrity of a file by checking its signature. The `verifyfile` command takes a file path as an argument, while the `verifyhash` command takes a file checksum as an argument.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in knowing more about token launches on Verus. What features does Verus offer for token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers a range of features for token launches, including: \n1. Maximum participation in one or more currencies\n2. Pre-launch discounts\n3. Price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs \n4. Price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds\n5. Pre-launch discounts for early participants\n6. Vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs\n\nThese features enable customizable and flexible token launches that can meet the needs of various use cases. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these features?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting! I also want to know more about the Verus network itself. What is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what are its benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains within the Verus network. This enables the creation of public blockchains for global use, as well as private, internal blockchains for organizations, with easy bridging of public currencies into the internal network. The benefits of this network include unlimited scale, decentralized bridge confirmation via Notary IDs, and the ability to interoperate between public and private blockchains. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, thanks for explaining that. Now, I have a more technical question. How do I lock and unlock an ID using the Verus command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo lock an ID, you can use the `setidentitytimelock` command with the `unlockatblock` parameter to set the unlock height of the identity. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\": <Unlock block height>}' \n```\nTo set a time delay for an ID's unlock, you can use the `setunlockdelay` parameter. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"setunlockdelay\": <Unlock block delay>}' \n```\nNote that revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. Also, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. Do you have any more questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nActually, one more question.

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. #### Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**  The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\": <Unlock block height>}' ``` - **Time Delay:**  The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"setunlockdelay\": <Unlock block delay>}' ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ### Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g. BTC ETH:** ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth ``` Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.#### Sending and Converting Currency **Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds. - **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):** `", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about ID registrations in fully decentralized fractional currencies.

Can the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies be set in a reserve currency, such as USDC or DAI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves, such as USDC or DAI.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the deal with referral support in ID registration?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nReferral support in ID registration allows for multiple levels of referral (up to 5 levels), which can reduce the ID registration fee.

The minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself, or in one of its reserves, for example USDC or DAI.More than the minimum price can be paid for ID registration, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace. Each currency, either centralized and/or fractional, can have multiple levels of referral support (limit of 5 levels), meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies, or be sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.While Native IDs, those registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, will be able to launch currencies on that blockchain, and if on Verus, actual independent blockchains, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, but will still be valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features, for proofs, for brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login, and will have the ability to cross-prove common ownership with other IDs as well.The exception to non-native IDs creating currencies, is that *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter and will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. Registration of .veth IDs will be priced at 100 USD worth of ETH to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nWhen I download Verus, there's always a `txt` file included. What's the purpose of that file, and how do I use it to verify the download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `txt` file includes the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. This file can be used to verify the download by extracting the archive, verifying the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extracting the archive to the desired directory. Do you have any further questions about verifying your download?\n\n**User:**\nAlso, I noticed that there's a new release, v0.9.4-2. What are the key features and changes in this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.9.4-2 release has no material mainnet changes. However, it includes some Ethereum bridge related fixes and a merge mining API change for testnet use. This release is mandatory for testnet use, and all merge mining nodes must upgrade to the new protocol to be compatible with each other and participate in cross-chain notarization rewards.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been learning about Verus, but I'd like to know more. What are some of the additional capabilities of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus has several additional capabilities, including on-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, as well as on-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming. It also supports on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles.

What is it, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. Buyers and sellers can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post their sale publicly for everyone to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries.

I've also heard about Verus Vault. What is it, and how does it protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows users to protect funds on a VerusID, even in the event of private key theft. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the funds cannot be spent until the ID is unlocked. During this time, the funds can still be staked on the Verus network and earn rewards.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was trying to get some information about my Verus wallet. What information does the `getwalletinfo` command provide about my wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getwalletinfo` command provides a range of information about your Verus wallet. It includes details such as the wallet version, total confirmed balance, total confirmed reserve balance, total unconfirmed balance, total unconfirmed reserve balance, total immature balance, total immature reserve balance, eligible staking balance, a JSON object with currencies and their balances, total number of transactions, timestamp of the oldest pre-generated key in the key pool, number of new keys pre-generated, timestamp that the wallet is unlocked for transfers, transaction fee configuration, and the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the HD seed. That's a lot of valuable information about your wallet! Do you have any other questions about the `getwalletinfo` command or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I'm trying to import an address into my wallet. What are the arguments for the `importaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `importaddress` command takes three arguments. The first is \"address\", which is a required string that specifies the address to be imported. The second is \"label\", which is an optional string that allows you to assign a label to the address. Finally, there's the \"rescan\" argument, which is an optional boolean that specifies whether to rescan the wallet for transactions. By default, \"rescan\" is set to true. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks! But I'm still a bit unclear about what the `importaddress` command does. Can you explain its purpose in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `importaddress` command is used to add an address or script (in hex) that can be watched as if it were in your wallet, but cannot be used to spend. This allows you to track transactions related to that address without having control over the associated private key. Think of it as a way to monitor an address without being able to spend from it.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and I'm curious about its blockchain creation and interoperability features. What is the main feature of the Verus network in terms of blockchain creation and interoperability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, with decentralized bridge confirmation provided by Notary IDs specified at chain definition. This enables public and private blockchains to operate and interoperate on the Verus network, with no limit on the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really powerful. What's the role of Notary IDs in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains to be easily set up with bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back.\n\n**User:**\nI've also come across IDs being locked on the Verus network. How can you lock an ID on the Verus network, and what are the implications of locking an ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock an ID on the Verus network by setting the `flags` parameter to a non-zero value and specifying a `timelock` parameter, which defines the unlock height of the identity. A locked identity cannot revoke itself, and revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the Verus API and I came across `getcurrencyconverters`. What is the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. This allows users to query for currencies that meet specific liquidity and reserve requirements.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really useful. How can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve currencies that have specific markets, such as BTC/ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve currencies that have specific markets, such as BTC/ETH, by specifying the market pairs as arguments, like this:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.

There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. ## Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**   The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'   ``` - **Time Delay:**   The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'   ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ## Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g.

How can I verify the integrity of a downloaded Verus package using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the integrity of a downloaded Verus package using the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command with the `verus` CLI tool.

Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, thanks for that. I was also wondering about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. What's that all about?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is an on-chain marketplace where you can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs in a completely decentralized way. You can advertise your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed directly, peer-to-peer, without any intermediary necessary. You can pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, and accept payment to either, while still having the ability to select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. Another thing I've been wondering about is Verus Vault. What's that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows you to protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key. If you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Additionally, you can still receive funds. Note that enabling revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities require you to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.

Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nHi! I've encountered an issue with my antivirus software. It's flagging the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a common issue. If your antivirus software flags the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", it's likely because the software is a mining tool, which may be used by third parties to exploit your PC. You can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives. Don't worry, it's a false alarm!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. But how can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can also use CLI examples to verify the file directly or using a checksum. The result will be \"true\" if the signature is valid.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. What are some of the benefits it offers to users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace offers several benefits to users, including decentralized transactions, transparency and auditability, security, and flexibility. Transactions are executed directly between parties, without the need for intermediaries. They're also recorded on the blockchain, making them transparent and auditable. Payments can be made from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, ensuring a high level of security. Plus, the platform allows for the selection and sharing of proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What else does Verus Vault offer, besides fund protection and recovery?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn addition to fund protection and recovery, Verus Vault also offers features like time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. It also provides security for IDs and NFTs, in addition to funds. And, it offers a decentralized solution for protecting and recovering blockchain assets and generational wealth.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I export an ID to a PBaaS chain using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nThis command exports the ID \"IDNAME@\" to the PBaaS chain \"PBaaSChainName\" with an amount of 100 VRSCTEST.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the requirements for enabling revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities, you must have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.\n\n**User:**\nWhat other use cases are supported by Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn addition to protecting funds from theft, Verus Vault also supports other use cases such as time locks for vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. It provides a decentralized solution for securing IDs, NFTs, and funds on the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nCan you tell me more about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform that allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain. It enables users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, without the need for intermediaries. Payments can be made from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, and transactions are auditable by the parties involved.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is Verus Vault, and how does it protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows users to protect funds on a VerusID by locking them, making it impossible to spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked. While locked, funds can still be staked on the Verus network and earn rewards. The lock can be circumvented by the revocation and recovery authority identities, which can revoke and recover the locked VerusID. This provides an additional layer of security and protection against theft or unauthorized access.\n\n**User:**\nHow does Verus Vault protect against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault protects against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" by allowing users to set a delay between unlocking and spending funds. This delay can be set to a predetermined time, such as 24 hours, giving the user or a designated revocation authority time to detect and respond to unauthorized unlocks.", "qa_tuples": [["What benefits does the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace offer to users?", "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace offers several benefits to users, including:\n\n1.

Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.### Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]' ```", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to learn more about some of the commands available in Verus. What information does the `getblocktemplate` command provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblocktemplate` command provides a template for building a new block, including information such as the range of valid nonces, the limit of sigops in blocks, the limit of block size, the current timestamp, the compressed target of the next block, and the height of the next block. This command is useful for miners who want to create a new block and need to know the specific requirements for the block to be valid.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What about the `getminingdistribution` command? What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getminingdistribution` command retrieves the current mining distribution, which includes a list of unique destination addresses and their relative values. If no mining distribution is set, the command returns a NULL object. This command is useful for miners who want to see how the mining rewards are distributed among the different addresses.\n\n**User:**\nGot it!

What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. What is it, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) directly on the blockchain. It allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, peer-to-peer, without the need for intermediaries.

What is it, and how does it protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows users to protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the funds cannot be spent from that identity until it is unlocked again. While locked, the funds can still be staked on the Verus network to earn rewards, and receipts of funds are still possible. To enable Verus Vault, a primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID must be configured. Do you have any questions about how it works?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, how does Verus Vault prevent unauthorized access to locked funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault prevents unauthorized access to locked funds by requiring a predetermined unlock time before the funds can be spent or accessed. This unlock time can be set by the user, and during this time, the revocation and recovery authority identities can revoke and recover the locked funds if an unauthorized unlock occurs. This provides a decentralized solution to the \"5-dollar wrench attack\", where a user's private keys are compromised, but the funds are still protected.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great. What other benefits does Verus Vault offer besides protecting funds from theft?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault also provides security for IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other purposes such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This allows users to protect and recover their digital assets, preserving their blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, without the need for a bank or intermediary. It's a powerful tool that gives users even more control over their digital assets.", "qa_tuples": [["What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does it work?", "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) directly on the blockchain.

Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.## Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering, what kind of warranty does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nWhat about liability? What liability do the authors or copyright holders of the Verus software have for any claims or damages arising from the use of the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn no event shall the authors or copyright holders of the Verus software be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. You're doing your due diligence, I like that!\n\n**User:**\nI noticed there are VirusTotal links provided for each platform. What's the purpose of those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VirusTotal links are provided to allow users to check the software for viruses or malware before downloading and installing it. That way, you can verify the software's authenticity and safety before using it.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a great idea. I've heard that Avast and Kaspersky might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAvast and Kaspersky might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC. However, rest assured that Verus is a legitimate software, and those flags are just a precautionary measure.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I verify the authenticity of a Verus software download? I want to make sure it's legit.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus software download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the download.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. How can I assist you today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to set up Verus Testnet on my computer, but I'm not sure where to find the configuration files. Can you help me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe configuration files for Verus Testnet are stored in different locations depending on your operating system. On Mac OS, you can find them in `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST` and `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest`. On Windows, they're stored in `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\VerusTest`. Do you have any other questions about setting up Verus Testnet?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. What's the main benefit of the Verus public testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main benefit of the Verus public testnet is that it enables anyone to create new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and customization when it comes to creating new blockchain projects.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really powerful. How does Verus Reserve cross-chain currency conversion technology work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Reserve cross-chain currency conversion technology enables sending currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies as easily as sending a cryptocurrency in less advanced systems today.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI've been looking into Bridge.vETH and I was wondering, what is it, and how can it be used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBridge.vETH is a 100% backed liquidity basket composed of 1/3rd each of Verus, Ethereum, and USDC testnet tokens. It can be used from Metamask on Goerli, from the Verus CLI or GUI on the vrsctest chain, or from CLI/GUI on other PBaaS chains to provide liquidity while holding Bridge.vETH, which is a 100% backed basket of three currencies of balanced relative value. Additionally, it can be used to pass through and convert currencies between Verus, Ethereum, USDC, and Bridge.vETH. Do you have any questions about how to use Bridge.vETH or its benefits?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also seen something called `vETH@` gateway. What's its purpose, and how does it relate to Bridge.vETH and `*.veth@` IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `vETH@` gateway coordinates with the Bridge.vETH currency and enables registering `*.veth@` IDs for $5 worth of Bridge.vETH, based on its internal USDC conversion price at the time of registration. When `*.veth@` IDs are registered, 0.02 VRSCTEST goes to miners and stakers, and $5 worth of Bridge.vETH is burned, reducing the total supply of Bridge.vETH for everyone without reducing reserves, and contributing to the relative value, \u201creal yield\u201d of Bridge.vETH, relative to its three reserve currencies. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I think so. What are `*.veth@` IDs, and what capabilities do they have?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n`*.veth@` IDs are special IDs that can be registered for $5 worth of Bridge.vETH. They have the ability, along with root vrsctest IDs, to make 1:1 ERC20 mapped currencies on Ethereum. They can also be used to create Tokenized ID control tokens, as all types of IDs can, but if they are used to do that, they will have used their currency creation ability for that rather than an ERC20 mapped currency. Do you have any questions about using `*.veth@` IDs?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I was wondering about Tokenizing ID control. What is it, and how does it relate to `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTokenizing ID control is a next-generation NFT feature that allows for the creation of tokenized control tokens. This feature is enabled by setting the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN` flags in a currency definition, and setting a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre-allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0. It's a powerful feature that allows for more flexibility and control in token management. Do you have any more questions about Tokenizing ID control?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. How can I reset my testnet environment?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your testnet environment, make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon is running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native). This should restore your testnet environment to its initial state.

Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been having some issues with my wallet. What happens if I end up on my own fork because of a network issue or having an old version of the wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you end up on your own fork because of a network issue or having an old version of the wallet, you can solve the problem in two ways: either by installing the latest bootstrap file (less work, big download) or by searching manually for the forked block and invalidating that block (time-consuming, no download needed). Would you like to know more about how to resolve the issue using the bootstrap file method?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that sounds like the easier option. What are the steps to resolve a blockchain synchronization issue by installing the latest bootstrap file?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo resolve a blockchain synchronization issue by installing the latest bootstrap file, follow these steps:\n\n1. Stop the wallet/mining process by cleanly shutting down the program.\n2. Update your wallet if necessary.\n3. Follow the procedure to efficiently rectify the problem.\n4. Be aware that your mining rewards may seem to come to a halt after resolving the issue, but this is because rewards from mining on the wrong chain are worthless.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to get back in sync with the main blockchain.

Stop the wallet/mining process by cleanly shutting down the program. 2. Update your wallet if necessary. 3. Follow the procedure in [HOW-TO Backup, Install or Update and Bootstrap your wallet.md](#!how-to/how-to_bootstrap.md) to efficiently rectify the problem. 4. Do not be dismayed if it seems that your mining rewards suddenly seem to come to a halt. Remember, when you mine to the wrong chain rewards can come in very quickly, but they are worth nothing.## Procedure 2 (Time consuming, no extra download)### Verus-Desktop 1. The commands are **all** entered in the *Native Client Terminal* that is located under `Settings`, `Coin Settings`. 2. Search for the **earliest** block that not matches the blockchain:   `run getblockhash <suspected blocknumber>` will show you the blockhash for the blocknumber you filled in   The response shown in the *Native Client Terminal* will be similar to this:   `5cc7844973fb95ef17f1772ea4aba579f0d8273fb0ee6064cd8e707d1056c646` 3. Check the blockhash your command gave you against the blockhash the [explorer](https://explorer.verus.io) shows. 4. If the blockhash from the explorer is different than yours, repeat steps 2 & 3 until you find the earliest block that is different. 5. Use the **earliest incorrect blockhash** from your system to invalidate that block:   `run invalidateblock <earliest incorrect blockhash>`   The *Native Client Terminal* will not give feedback on this command. 6. Now use the **correct blockhash** that the explorer gave you for the block you just locally invalidated:   `run reconsiderblock <correct blockhash>`   Again the *Native Client Terminal* will not give feedback on this command. 7. Once your wallet connects to a node that is on the correct chain, it will quicly synchronize.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm really new to all this. Maybe it's a bit basic, but, what is Verus ID and what are its key features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus ID is a revolutionary, new decentralized identity technology that provides a secure, quantum-ready, fully decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity system. Its key features include built-in privacy through zk-SNARKs, improved blockchain address security, recovery of lost keys, security against identity and key theft, and the ability to prove things about oneself without revealing extra information. That's quite a mouthful, but essentially, Verus ID is a game-changer for digital identity and security.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting.

What is VerusHash 2.1, and how does it compare to VerusHash 2.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 is an improvement to the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm, which was designed to equalize FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs.

This release also introduces a new smart transaction technology that is unique to the Verus network and replaces its use of Komodo compatible crypto-conditions. The Verus ID system was made possible through the use of Verus Smart Transactions, which will be available for everyone to use on their own blockchains in the upcoming PBaaS network upgrade. Verus Smart Transactions use standard Bitcoin style serialization rather than the ASN.1 used in crypto conditions, which makes support on lite or mobile wallets simpler to implement than the crypto-condition protocol, which is still used on the Verus network for Stake Guard. ## VerusHash 2.1 VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# Verus ID - A Better Blockchain Identity Technology If you\u2019ve been around crypto for even a little while, you\u2019ll start to hear things like \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d, \u201close your keys, lose your coins\u201d.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help you understand more about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering, what are some benefits of using VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs offer several benefits, including protection against $5 wrench attacks and identity theft. They can also be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. Additionally, the VerusID protocol is a decentralized protocol that can be implemented on non-Verus systems. This means you get the security and flexibility you need for your digital identity.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! What capabilities do users have when creating their own tokens or blockchains using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsing Verus, any user with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. These blockchains can be 50% POW/50% POS and 51% hash attack resistant, and can be merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. This gives you the power to create your own blockchain ecosystem with the features you need.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about DeFi liquidity pools in Verus. Can you tell me more about them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, DeFi liquidity pools allow ID owners to define fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities. It's a powerful way to create flexible and secure financial instruments.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen mentions of simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches in Verus. What's the significance of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, it is possible to launch a world-class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. This means that the bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity. This allows for fully integrated and flexible blockchain ecosystems to be launched quickly and easily.\n\n**User:**\nHow do blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches work in Verus, and what happens if minimum participation is not met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches allow users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on-chain. If by the start time of the blockchain, the minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund. This applies to both single launches and dual launches (blockchain and bridge).

There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. ### Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}' ``` - **Time Delay:**  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}' ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ## Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reser", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHi! I'm trying to get a better understanding of Verus. What information does the `getpeerinfo` command provide about connected peers in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getpeerinfo` command is a great tool for getting information about connected peers. It provides detailed information, including:\n\n* Peer index (`id`)\n* IP address and port (`addr`)\n* Local address (`addrlocal`)\n* Services offered (`services`)\n* Time of last send and receive (`lastsend` and `lastrecv`)\n* Total bytes sent and received (`bytessent` and `bytesrecv`)\n* Connection time (`conntime`)\n* Time offset (`timeoffset`)\n* Ping time and wait (`pingtime` and `pingwait`)\n* Peer version and string version (`version` and `subver`)\n* Inbound or outbound connection (`inbound`)\n* Starting block height (`startingheight`)\n* Ban score (`banscore`)\n* Last common header and block (`synced_headers` and `synced_blocks`)\n* Heights of blocks currently being asked from the peer (`inflight`)\n\nThis command can be really helpful for debugging and understanding how your node is interacting with other nodes on the network.

What is the purpose of the `ping` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `ping` command is a simple but useful tool. It's used to measure ping time by sending a ping to all other nodes. The results are provided in the `getpeerinfo` command, specifically in the `pingtime` and `pingwait` fields, which are measured in decimal seconds. The `ping` command is handled in a queue with all other commands, so it measures processing backlog, not just network ping. This can help you understand how your node is performing and identify any potential issues. Do you have any other questions about the `ping` command or Verus?\n\n**User:**\nAnd one more question, how can I use the `listbanned` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listbanned` command is a straightforward one. It can be used to list all banned IPs/Subnets. You can run it using the following commands:\n\n```\nverus listbanned\n```\n\nor\n\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"listbanned\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\nThis command can be helpful for managing your node's banlist and ensuring that you're not interacting with malicious or unwanted peers.

It is recommended to update to v1.0.3 or greater before the activation block. You should be all set then!\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! What additional capabilities does Verus offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers several additional capabilities, including on-chain launches of token, centralized currency, and liquidity basket AMMs, on-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming, and on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles. It's a very powerful and flexible platform!\n\n**User:**\nOne of the things that caught my attention was the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on-chain. Users can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT or post the sale on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, with the option to pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address. The platform allows for peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, while still making room for owners to select and share proceeds with value-added agents or other participants.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. I also heard about Verus Vault. Can you explain what it is and how it protects funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a security feature that allows users to lock their VerusID, protecting funds from theft even in the event of a private key being stolen. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the user cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. However, the user can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. The lock can be revoked and recovered by the revocation and recovery authority identities, which can circumvent the lock. This provides a decentralized solution to the \"5 dollar wrench attack\".\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know!

Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.#### Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some of the commands in the CLI interface. What is the purpose of the `sendrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendrawtransaction` command is used to adapt and issue a transaction on the Verus network.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get a better understanding of how Proof of Stake (PoS) works. How can I estimate the number of blocks I can expect to get on average from PoS with a certain amount of mature coins in my public address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use a staking calculator spreadsheet to estimate the number of blocks you can expect to get on average from PoS. The spreadsheet allows you to input your current block height and amount of coins you are staking, as well as a percentage for guessing how many coins are actually staking. This will give you an estimate of your average block reward. Have you tried using the spreadsheet already, or would you like more information on how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What about the block reward? When is the next halving, what is the block reward, and how long will it last?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the same staking calculator spreadsheet to find out when the next halving is, what the block reward will be, and how long it will last.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm new to all this, so I'll start with the basics. What is a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides a decentralized identity system. It is not controlled by a corporation and offers various benefits such as quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses, full decentralization, and opportunities for identity applications. Do you have any other questions about VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm curious about using VerusIDs for sending and receiving funds. What are the benefits of using a VerusID for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If the controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. This adds an extra layer of security and flexibility to your transactions. Do you have any other questions about using VerusIDs for sending and receiving funds?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that quantum computers might be a threat to some crypto systems. Are VerusIDs resistant to quantum attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, a quantum secure signature scheme is being integrated and is expected to be activated on mainnet soon. This will allow for retroactive quantum resistance of funds sent to an ID. So, you can rest assured that your VerusID is secure against quantum attacks.\n\n**User:**\nYou mentioned that VerusIDs are fully decentralized. What does that mean exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are fully decentralized, meaning anyone can create one and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. This means that you have full control over your identity and data, and you don't need to rely on a central authority to manage it. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great. What are some of the features of VerusIDs that make them secure?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs have several features that make them secure, including being revocable and recoverable. Each ID includes a revocation authority and a separate recovery authority, which can be used to revoke or recover the identity in case of key theft or turnover in an organization. This adds an extra layer of security and flexibility to your identity management.

If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.* Recoverable -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/verusid.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about using my VerusID as a cryptocurrency address. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYour VerusID can be used as a friendly name cryptocurrency address for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. This means you can use your VerusID to receive and send cryptocurrencies on any blockchain within the Verus network.

Can you tell me more about it and how it addresses MEV and front-running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol enables ID owners to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. This protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers. It's a game-changer for DeFi!\n\n**User:**\nWow, that sounds really powerful! How can users create and manage their own token currencies or blockchains using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsers with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain. This blockchain can be 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant, and can be merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.

Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAny ID owner can define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities.\n\n**User:**\nSecurity is also really important to me. What is Verus Vault, and how does it help prevent theft?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that enables time locking and theft prevention for identities. When an identity is locked, no funds under its control can be spent while it's locked, but staking of funds is still allowed. A user specifies an unlock delay when locking an ID, which prevents unauthorized access to the funds. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover the ID. Users can also create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID, making it virtually theft-proof.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, what is the benefit of creating a decentralized token or blockchain using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith Verus, any user with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can interact with the Verus chain. This blockchain can be 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant, and can send and receive from the Verus chain. Additionally, all PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, allowing projects to join the worldwide Verus community and improve the daemon, starting with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI just exported my wallet from Verus, and I'm not sure what to do with the exported wallet file (`mywalletexport`). What should I do with it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou should keep the exported wallet file (`mywalletexport`) secure, as it contains your plaintext private keys. Make sure to verify that the file is not empty and store it in a safe location, along with your `wallet.dat` backup. Don't share it with anyone or store it in an insecure location.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! I'm planning to reset my Verus wallet. What steps should I take after exporting my wallet to ensure a safe and complete reset of my Verus wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter exporting your wallet, you should:\n\n1. Stop Verus by closing Verus-Desktop, Agama, or running `./verus stop` for the Linux CLI or `verus.bat stop` for the Windows CLI.\n2. Delete your komodo/VRSC directory and everything in it, except for your `VRSC.conf` file if you want to keep it.\n3. Make sure you have the latest version of your wallet by checking the downloads section on the Verus website.\n4. Restart your wallet by launching Verus-Desktop, Agama, or running `verusd` for the CLI, and allow it to start syncing.\n\nThis will ensure a clean and complete reset of your Verus wallet.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the unlock delay in VerusIDs. What's the purpose of it, and how can it be circumvented?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe unlock delay in VerusIDs is typically set to be long enough to allow the user to notice if someone has compromised their keys. This delay prevents unauthorized access to the ID. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover the ID. Additionally, users can create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID, which enables a virtually theft-proof workflow and solutions to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the $5 wrench attack, and identity theft.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been curious about the VerusID protocol itself. Can you tell me more about it and how it can be used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusID protocol is a protocol that enables the creation of friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. This protocol can also be implemented on non-Verus systems. It allows users to create and manage their own decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without requiring programming knowledge.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really powerful.

All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects can choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon.

I've also heard about consensus-integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets in Verus. Can you explain what those are?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, any ID owner can define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner-extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.", "qa_tuples": [["What is the purpose of the unlock delay in VerusIDs, and how can it be circumvented?", "The unlock delay in VerusIDs is typically set to be long enough to allow the user to notice if someone has compromised their keys.

The rest of the world is stuck on their Munchausen\u2019s protocols, trying to figure out how to share the front-running and back-running spoils taken from users, but Verus activation gives them a better path forward.As always, we do not promise, we describe a vision and welcome contributors from everywhere. Now that we, as a community, have delivered on the original phases of the vision together, it is time for all of us to consider what we might want to build over this incredible, geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform. Our next efforts across the community should be to realize the promise of this network in the use cases we create, use cases that we will have an advantage creating on Verus over any other platform because it really is that much better.### Additional Verus Capabilities - On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs - On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming - On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to configure my Verus miner to run on low priority on Windows, so it doesn't interfere with other processes on my PC. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo configure your Verus miner to run on low priority on Windows, you'll need to adjust the batch file of your chosen miner (NHEQminer or CCMiner) to run with the `/Low` priority flag. This will ensure that your miner throttles down whenever your PC needs processing power, allowing you to run CPU-heavy applications like games without interference.\n\nBefore we dive into the batch file adjustments, do you have the required pool-mining software downloaded and extracted?\n\n**User:**\nActually, no. I'm not sure where to find it or what I need to download.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo worries!

This will result in your miner throttling down whenever your PC needs processing power. People have reported to be able to use CPU-heavy applications, like games, without the miner interfering, with this method. Because the Verus wallet (GUI and CLI) does a lot more than mining, it is not recommended to use this for a solo-mining setup. This is tested on Verus NHEQminer and Verus CCMiner on Windows 10. First thing you will need is pool-mining software. The link is supplied above this procedure. Download your preferred miner, extract it to your prefered location and configure the batchfile with the pool of your choice and your own mining address. Now we'll need to adjust the batchfile to run on low priority: ##### NHEQMINER: - change to the folder you extracted the download  - edit the `start.bat`  - Scroll down to the line, that needs to be adjusted:    `nheqminer.exe -v -l %PoolHost%:%Port% -u %PublicVerusCoinAddress%.%WorkerName% -t %Threads% %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9`  - adjust the line so it looks like this:    `%windir%\\system32\\cmd.exe /c start \"NHEQminer VRSC\" /Low \"%THIS_DIR%\\nheqminer.exe\" -v -l %PoolHost%:%Port% -u %PublicVerusCoinAddress%.%WorkerName% -t %Threads% %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9`  - save and exit the file  - run `start.bat` to start mining ##### CCMINER: - Change to the folder you put the three files from the downloaded archive in (`run.verushhash.bat`, `libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll` & `ccminer.exe`)  - edit the `run.verushhash.bat`  - The line, that needs to be adjusted:    `ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://na.luckpool.net:3956 -u REoPcdGXthL5yeTCrJtrQv5xhYTknbFbec.Donator -p d=6 -t 8`  - adjust the line, so it looks like:    `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c start \"ccminerCPUv3.5 VerusPool\" /Low \"c:\\Miners\\CCminer 2.0 CPU Release 3.5\\ccminer.exe\" -a verus -o stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -t 16`  - make sure you replace the pool (`stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999`) with your prefered pool and the address   (`RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ`) with your own address. The address shown in this line is the veruscoin   foundation donation address. If desired change the identifier (`Donator`) to a name that easily identifies the   miner to you.  - save and exit the file  - run `run.verushhash.bat` to start mining.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI just downloaded Verus, but I want to make sure it's authentic. How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command in the Verus CLI. The `verifyfile` command takes three arguments: the identity of the signer, the signature, and the path to the file to be verified. The `verifyhash` command takes four arguments: the identity of the signer, the signature, the expected hash, and the path to the file to be verified.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n**Verifying file directly**\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AT9MDwABQR+giVSMbRiq3p60hCUVfEdm/yPLZYjX1Eh+ufvtnpDPhyjvjUGQRClss+mQohhXPxfWY5oqIzfioqJsnHHlo2XH /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.6.5-amd64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.6.5-amd64.tar.gz\n```\n\n**Verifying using a checksum**\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AT9MDwABQR+giVSMbRiq3p60hCUVfEdm/yPLZYjX1Eh+ufvtnpDPhyjvjUGQRClss+mQohhXPxfWY5oqIzfioqJsnHHlo2XH 60020bfebbb2ced560c5d1e1333c43d9f80c4db4797812213ae04ad39df99c22\n```\n\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.

They provide capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management, including friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.

How do Verus digital signatures compare to those offered by Bitcoin and its derivatives?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhile Bitcoin and its derivatives do offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses, they lack critical capabilities to make them suitable as an actual identity. Verus digital signatures, on the other hand, offer more sophisticated key management, including the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.

While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with VerusIDs and currencies, and I was wondering, are there any limitations to creating a currency from an ID in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address as a currency name will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also trying to create a currency in the GUI, and I ran into another issue. What's the limitation there?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the GUI, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey, I'm still learning about Verus. Can you tell me, what is a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is a true self-sovereign identity that is a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. It provides a range of features and benefits, including quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses, full decentralization, revocability, and recoverability. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm still a bit unclear on what \"quantum ready\" means. Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, meaning they are future-proof against potential quantum computer attacks. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs themselves are resistant to quantum attacks. Additionally, a quantum secure signature scheme is being integrated, which will allow for retroactive quantum resistance for funds sent to a VerusID. That should help clarify things!\n\n**User:**\nAnother thing I'm not quite sure about is the revocation authority in a VerusID. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe revocation authority in a VerusID is a feature that allows the identity to be revoked, effectively freezing all of its funds. This can be useful in cases of key theft or other security breaches. The revocation authority defaults to the identity self, but can be set to another ID. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or revocation authorities?", "qa_tuples": [["What is a VerusID?", "A VerusID is a true self-sovereign identity that is a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system.

There is no business in the protocol, but plenty of opportunity for those who use what it can do for identity applications. Verus ID provides:**Quantum ready** friendly crypto addresses on the worldwide Verus network -- VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID -> destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.**Fully decentralized** -- anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.**Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.**Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/verus-welcome.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHi! I'm interested in staking, but I'm not sure where to start. Where can I find a list of staking pools that I can join?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find lists of staking pools to join at [Dudezmobi](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Up1WbMuCR21e6TxLae6zjLJePu_RIOVZwqShRj9vVvc/edit?usp=sharing) or [Ginasis](https://discord.gg/4FJJRY5). But before you join a pool, I want to make sure you're aware of the pros and cons of pool staking compared to solo staking.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a great point. What are the disadvantages of joining a staking pool compared to solo staking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are several disadvantages to joining a staking pool compared to solo staking. For instance, it can lead to centralization on the network. The pool owner has control over all funds in the pool, including yours. You need to trust the pool operator to share the rewards fairly and to release your funds back to you on request. Additionally, you need to trust the pool operator to securely run the pool 24/7. These are important considerations to keep in mind before joining a pool.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What about the advantages of joining a staking pool? Are there any benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne advantage of joining a staking pool is that you don't need to run your wallet 24/7 in native mode. This can be a big plus for people who don't have the technical expertise or resources to run their own staking setup.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What should I do before deciding whether to join a staking pool or stake solo?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBefore making a decision, I would recommend doing your own research. Look into the different staking pools available, read reviews and testimonials from other users, and weigh the pros and cons of each option. It's also important to educate yourself on the technical aspects of staking and the Verus network.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `revokeidentity` command in Verus. Can you tell me what the format of the result returned by this command is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `revokeidentity` command is a JSON object with several properties. These properties include `txid`, which is the transaction ID of the revocation transaction, and `namereservation`, which is an object containing information about the name reservation. This information includes the name, salt, referral (if any), parent (if not Verus or Verus test), and name ID (if the identity is created). Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! I'm still a bit unclear on what the `revokeidentity` command does, though. Can you explain its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `revokeidentity` command is used to revoke an identity on the Verus blockchain. This command can also be used to create a name commitment, which is not the same as registering a name. The command takes several arguments, including the name or ID to revoke, an optional return transaction flag, an optional token revoke flag, a non-standard fee amount, and an optional source of funds.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the role of Notary IDs in the Verus network. What's their purpose, and how do they enable decentralized bridge confirmation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. They play a crucial role in the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nAnother question about IDs. How can I lock an ID on the Verus network, and what's the purpose of the timelock parameter?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock an ID on the Verus network using the `updateidentity` API, setting the `flags` to 0 and specifying the `timelock` parameter as the unlock block height. The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity, and can also be used to set a time delay for unlocking an ID.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens when I revoke an identity that has been locked, and can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRevoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. A locked identity cannot revoke itself. So, revoking an ID will completely remove the lock.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of the `getcurrencyconverters` API. What is it used for on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It's a useful tool for finding currencies that meet specific liquidity thresholds.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the main benefit of the Verus network in terms of blockchain creation and interoperability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, which can be public or private, and can be easily bridged to connect public currencies to an organization's internal private network. This is a huge advantage in terms of flexibility and connectivity.\n\n**User:**\nCan you explain how to use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve currencies that meet certain criteria?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve currencies that meet certain criteria, for example, by specifying two currencies like `btc` and `eth`. This will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds by specifying the sender's address, the recipient's address, the currency, and the amount. You can also use it to send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, and to convert funds from one currency to another.\n\n**User:**\nHow do Notary IDs contribute to the functionality of the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can easily be set up with bridging of public currencies.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a locked identity if it is revoked on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRevoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. So, the lock is completely removed when an ID is revoked.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. How can you use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve currencies that meet specific liquidity thresholds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves.

Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.### Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI have a question about exporting IDs to PBaaS chains. How can I do it using the command line and Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo export an ID to a PBaaS chain, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nThis command exports the ID \"IDNAME@\" to the PBaaS chain \"PBaaSChainName\" with an amount of 100 VRSCTEST. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I also have a question about signing transactions from multi-signature IDs. How can I do that on the testnet and mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency`.\n2. Take the raw hex transaction data and provide it to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n3. Use `verus signrawtransaction` to sign the raw hex transaction data on each wallet.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on both the testnet and mainnet. Do you have any more questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I've been hearing about the new Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning about crowdfunding currency launches on Verus. Can you tell me how they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches allow for the creation of new blockchains with minimum participation requirements. If the minimum participation levels are not met by the launch time, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations, and vesting schedules. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What about time locks and time delays on Verus IDs? How do those work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTime locks and time delays are features of Verus IDs that allow for control over when an ID can be used. A time lock defines the unlock height of the identity, specifying the block height at which the ID will be unlocked. A time delay, on the other hand, defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. These features can be set using the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter.\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to know more about the crowdfunding currency launch feature on the Verus network. Can you explain it in more detail?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe crowdfunding currency launch feature on the Verus network allows for blockchain-based currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds. This means that you can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on the chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, the minimums are not met, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees.\n\n**User:**\nAre there any additional features available for launches on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are. Some of the additional features available for launches on the Verus network include maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly, price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds, pre-launch discounts for early participants, and vesting schedules in the pre-allocations using VerusIDs.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what are its benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a decentralized network that allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. This network enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can be easily set up with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back.

Why haven't I been able to find one?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo understand why you haven't found a block yet, you need to consider the average time it takes to find one block.

But what factors affect the average time to find one block?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe average time to find one block is affected by three main factors: NetworkHashrate, LocalHashrate, and BlockTime. NetworkHashrate is the total hashrate of the entire Verus network, LocalHashrate is your own mining rig's hashrate, and BlockTime is the average time it takes to mine one block, which is 60 seconds in Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense.

For example, if the NetworkHashrate is 851125882237, your LocalHashrate is 46159950, and the BlockTime is 60 seconds, the calculation would be: `Average Time To Find One Block = (851125882237 / 46159950) * 60`. This would give you an average time to find one block of approximately 1,106,317 seconds, or around 13 days.\n\n**User:**\nSo, does this mean that I'll find a block in 13 days?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the calculated average time to find one block is not a guarantee of when you'll find a block. It's an average value, which means that in real life, you may find a block much sooner or later than the calculated time. However, in the long run, the actual time it takes to find blocks will average out to the predicted value.", "qa_tuples": [["Why haven't I found a block yet, even though I've been mining for a while?", "To understand why you haven't found a block yet, you need to consider the average time it takes to find one block.

Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is revocable because it includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity itself. This authority has the permission to revoke the identity, creating a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered.

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network. # Disclaimer", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI heard about the v0.9.9 release of Verus and its significance in bridging blockchain networks. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.9.9 release of Verus is indeed a significant milestone. It's the first release of any blockchain protocol that enables cryptographically provable, cross-chain bridging across Verus and all PBaaS and other connected blockchains in the network, with or without the need for notary witnesses. This is a major step forward in interoperability and usability.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds impressive. I'd like to know more about the auto-notarization technology in Verus. How does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe auto-notarization technology in Verus works by using cryptographic evidence to ensure that cross-chain transactions are secure and difficult to manipulate. It can be thought of as \"Proof of Proof of Power\" because it relies on cryptographic proof and challenge resolution between merge miners and stakers. This technology allows for cross-chain transactions to complete even without notary witnesses, although it may be slower.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what's the role of notary witnesses in the cross-chain bridging technology of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary witnesses are used to speed up cross-chain transactions in Verus. When they are operational, transactions complete faster. However, even if they stop witnessing for any reason, the protocol will fail-over to auto-notarization, ensuring that cross-chain transactions still function as expected.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. How can a chain launch specify notary witnesses in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA chain launch in Verus can specify notary witnesses by using the `\u201cnotarizationprotocol\u201d:1` option, which is also the default. This allows the chain to use notary witnesses when they are operational, and fail-over to auto-notarization if they stop witnessing.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the current recommendation for launching serious PBaaS chains in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe current recommendation is to launch serious PBaaS chains with operational notary witnesses until further notice, as the auto-notarization technology has not yet been proven to an academic standard.

With notary witnesses, cross-chain transactions complete faster, but they are also checked against cryptographic evidence, making it difficult to impossible for anyone, including notary witnesses to take any action, even colluding with validators that would go against the wishes of the most chain power. We have been referring to this new cross-chain consensus technology as \u201cauto-notarization\u201d, as that is what it actually is, but it would also be accurate to call it Proof of Proof of Power, as that is how it works. For purposes of ensuring everyone understands the state of the technology, it is fully functional and we have taken great care to ensure it is sufficiently secure, but we have not yet had the protocol proven to an academic standard. Because of that, while it provides a security fall-back against misbehaving notary witnesses and will be fully functional and we believe sufficiently secure without notary witnesses on release, we currently recommend toconsider the protocol unproven at this time and that any serious PBaaS chains be launched with operational notary witnesses until further notice.Using `\u201cnotarizationprotocol\u201d:1`, which is also the default, a chain launch can specify notary witnesses that will be used when they do their job.

This cross-chain proof and challenge protocol operates even when witnesses are also operating and if miners and stakers continue to prove a more powerful chain than the one witnesses represent, the most powerful chain can still be confirmed. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing some rumors about the RaceCondition currency on the Verus chain. What's going on with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the RaceCondition currency was launched with a very low reserve of 10 VRSC, a high supply of 100 million, and a volatile 5% algorithmically controlled fractional reserve of Verus. The creator of the currency exited with their entire pre-launch amount, leaving the currency with far fewer reserves relative to supply than it had before, essentially performing an exit scam.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds pretty serious.

While these currencies are tools, and there may be good reasons for 5% currency components or even 5% currencies in some applications, this was launched as a VERY low reserve (launched with 10 VRSC in reserves), high supply currency (100 million supply), and as volatile as the protocol allows at 5%.The extreme nature of the currency and the fact that the person who launched it exited with their entire pre-launch amount when someone else joined resulted in a behavior different than what I would expect. Someone converted into the currency, which was clearly all in the hands of one individual. That individual then converted all of the currency they got at launch to VRSC, getting the highest price they could get for all of their currency and leaving the highly volatile, 5% fractionally backed currency with far fewer reserves relative to supply than it had before, basically an exit scam for a grand total of 4 VRSC.The thing that made me take notice is that there seemed to be more reserves left and a higher price at the end of this operation than I\u2019d expect in the currency, and that turned out to be because only in the case of a straight conversion from fractional to a reserve, not in any other case, the fractional currency fees that should have been burned into the basket were not being captured. Interestingly, in this case it resulted in a form of buffer at the extreme, where the person who entered RaceCondition for 5 VRSC after it was launched and subsequently had 4 of it taken on the exit from one person converting 100,000,000 of the supply ended up with more than they would have, had the math been properly distributing those fees. This was the totality of the issue we found, and though it may not seem that serious to require a pause of DeFi, these calculations are consensus, and we take any error that we find in them, fees or otherwise, quite seriously.

This method is not recommended for a solo-mining setup because the Verus wallet (both GUI and CLI) does more than just mining, and deprioritizing the wallet's process could interfere with its other functions. It's essential to ensure the wallet can function correctly to maintain the integrity of your setup.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've seen some people adding `nice -n 19 ` to their mining commands. What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAdding `nice -n 19 ` to the command when running the miner deprioritizes the mining process, allowing it to throttle down when the PC needs processing power for other tasks. This prevents the miner from interfering with other CPU-heavy applications, such as games. It's a way to ensure a smooth experience while still allowing you to mine.\n\n**User:**\nI'm using NHEQminer, and I want to configure my batch file to run the miner on low priority.

Attention: Read it completely before use. ### Links to VRSC miners: [Miners download page](https://verus.io/get-vrsc) ## Procedure: In order to let your mining not interfere with other processes running on your PC, we'll need to deprioritize the mining process. This will result in your miner throttling down whenever your PC needs processing power. People have reported to be able to use CPU-heavy applications, like games, without the miner interfering, with this method. Because the Verus wallet (GUI and CLI) does a lot more than mining, it is not recommended to use this for a solo-mining setup. This is tested on Verus NHEQminer and Verus CCMiner on Ubuntu 18.04. First thing you will need is pool-mining software. The link is supplied above this procedure. Download your preferred miner, extract it to your prefered location and configure the batchfile with the pool of your choice and your own mining address. Now we'll need to adjust the batchfile to run on low priority: ##### NHEQMINER: - Run your miner as you normally would, with `nice -n 19 ` placed in front of the command you normally use,   for example:    `nice -n 19 ./nheqminer -v -l pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -p x -t 6`  - make sure you replace the pool (`pool.verus.io:9999`) with your prefered pool and the address   (`RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ`) with your own address. The address shown in this line is the veruscoin   foundation donation address. If desired change the identifier (`Donator`) to a name that easily identifies the   miner to you. ##### CCMINER: - Run your miner as you normally would, with `nice -n 19 ` placed in front of the command you normally use,   for example:    `nice -n 19 ./ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -t 6`  - make sure you replace the pool (`stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999`) with your prefered pool and the address   (`RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ`) with your own address.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm wondering, how can I check the current generation and minting setting using the Verus command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can check the current generation and minting setting using the following command:\n```\nverus getgenerate\n```\nThis will give you the information you need about the current generation and minting settings. Do you have any other questions about this or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I do! What is the purpose of the `getidentitieswithaddress` method in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getidentitieswithaddress` method returns all identities that contain a specified address in its primary addresses. It can also filter the results by block height range and whether the identity is spent or unspent. This method is useful when you need to find all identities associated with a particular address.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful! What are the required and optional arguments for the `getidentitieswithaddress` method in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required argument is the `address` parameter, which is a string representing the valid primary address to search for. The optional arguments are:\n\n* `fromheight`: a number representing the block height to start searching from (default is 0)\n* `toheight`: a number representing the block height to stop searching at (default is 0)\n* `unspent`: a boolean indicating whether to only return active ID UTXOs as of the current block height (default is false)\n\nThese arguments allow you to customize your search and get the specific results you need.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what is the format of the result returned by the `getidentitieswithaddress` method in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result is an array of objects, where each object represents an identity that matches the search criteria. The object includes the identity's details and an additional `txout` member with the transaction hash and output index. This format makes it easy to work with the results and extract the information you need.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question: how can I turn on generation and minting using the Verus command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can turn on generation and minting using the following command:\n```\nverus setgenerate true 0\n```\nThis will enable generation and minting on your Verus node.

Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that makes sense. And how can the controller of the chain ID mint new coins in a currency that has `proofprotocol` set to 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe controller of the chain ID can mint new coins using the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option set to 1. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command would mint 10,000 new units of the \"mycoin\" currency and send them to the address \"mike@\".

What is a PBaaS blockchain, and how is it defined in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) blockchain is a type of blockchain that allows for the creation of private blockchains with customizable properties. In Verus, a PBaaS blockchain is defined using the `definecurrency` command with a JSON object that specifies the properties of the blockchain.

It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.### Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you understand more about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nHi! I'm interested in learning about Verus DeFi and its capabilities. Can you explain how simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches work in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, it is possible to launch a new blockchain simultaneously with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This bridge converter currency has the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but it is bound to the launch of the new blockchain and runs on the new blockchain. All fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, ensuring seamless connectivity.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! I'm also curious about the type of currencies that can be created using the Verus DeFi protocol. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol allows for the creation of fractional basket currencies, which are backed by one or more asset currencies at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. These currencies have one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage, which can be a combination of different currencies.\n\n**User:**\nHow do bridge converter currencies work in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBridge converter currencies in Verus have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies. However, they are bound to the launch of a new blockchain, run on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the concept of Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi fractional basket currencies are a type of currency that has one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. This means that the value of the currency is backed by a pool of assets, which can be a combination of different currencies. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing issues such as miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running.\n\n**User:**\nHow do blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches work in Verus, and what features do they offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches allow users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimum levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, vesting schedules, and pre-launch discounts for early participants.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi fractional basket currencies are a type of currency that has one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. This means that the value of the currency is backed by a pool of assets, which can be a combination of different currencies or assets. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, which helps to prevent issues like miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running.\n\n**User:**\nHow does the Verus DeFi protocol address the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This means that all conversions are processed at the same time, which prevents miners from manipulating the order of transactions to extract value or front-run other transactions.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is a bridge converter liquidity pool, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA bridge converter liquidity pool is a type of liquidity pool that is launched simultaneously with a new blockchain. It allows for the conversion of assets between the new blockchain and other blockchains, and all fees generated through cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but are bound to the launch of the new blockchain and run on the new blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what benefits does it provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is an interoperable network that allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `setidentitytimelock` command, and I'm trying to wrap my head around a few of the arguments. Can you explain how `unlockatblock` differs from `setunlockdelay`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n`unlockatblock` and `setunlockdelay` are two different ways to specify a time lock for an ID. `unlockatblock` sets an absolute block height at which the ID will be unlocked, whereas `setunlockdelay` sets a delay in blocks after the unlock request is made. The key difference is that `unlockatblock` starts counting down immediately, whereas `setunlockdelay` only starts counting down when the ID is unlocked. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat clears things up. Another argument I'm not sure about is `returntx`. What does it do in the `setidentitytimelock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `returntx` argument in the `setidentitytimelock` command is a boolean flag that defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the command will return a hex-serialized transaction that has been signed by the wallet, but not yet submitted to the network. This transaction must then be sent using the `sendrawtransaction` command after any necessary signatures are applied. It gives you more control over the transaction process.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! And one more question: what's the purpose of the `unlockatblock` argument in the `setidentitytimelock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `unlockatblock` argument in the `setidentitytimelock` command is used to specify an absolute block height at which the ID will be automatically unlocked. This countdown starts when the block is mined, and the ID will be unlocked when the specified block is reached. It's a way to schedule the unlocking of an ID at a specific point in the future.", "qa_tuples": [["How does `unlockatblock` differ from `setunlockdelay`?", "`unlockatblock` and `setunlockdelay` are two different ways to specify a time lock for an ID. `unlockatblock` sets an absolute block height at which the ID will be unlocked, whereas `setunlockdelay` sets a delay in blocks after the unlock request is made.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm really new to all this. Maybe it's a bit basic, but, what is Verus, and how does it differ from a traditional blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus is more than just a single blockchain; it's an entire ecosystem of interconnected blockchains that operate decentralized and at the protocol level. Verus introduces Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service), a true publicly notarized blockchain as a service with an easy-to-use built-in wallet UI.

What benefits do they offer to users and miners?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus PBaaS and merge mining offer several benefits to both users and miners. Newly created chains are just as secure as Verus itself, and they have the ability to be merge mined (up to 22x at once). This benefits both users and miners, self-strengthening the ecosystem and ensuring minimal fees (no room for middlemen to take a cut). It's a win-win for everyone involved! Do you have any more questions about Verus PBaaS or merge mining?\n\n**User:**\nAnother aspect I'm curious about is how Verus handles conversions and cross-chain transactions. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nConversions are handled by a built-in market maker that automatically determines price based on a predetermined curve and issues orders fairly to all buy/sells within a block, with zero spread. Exchanging currencies in cross-chain transactions is as simple as sending coins from one wallet to a different coin's wallet. Additionally, reserve-backed currencies are possible with fractional reserve capabilities. It's designed to be seamless and efficient! Do you have any more questions about conversions or cross-chain transactions on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I was wondering about the significance of Verus operating at the protocol level on a decentralized network. What does that mean for the ecosystem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe fact that Verus operates at the protocol level on a decentralized network means that Verus and its associated chains can't be censored or stopped.

Newly created chains are just as secure as Verus itself and have the ability to be merge mined (up to __22x__ at once\\!)Benefiting both the user and the miners, self-strengthening the ecosystem and ensuring minimal fees (no room for middlemen to take a cut). Reserve backed currencies are also possible with __fractional reserve__ capabilities and since interoperability is paramount, exchanging currencies in __cross-chain transactions__ is as simple as sending coins from one wallet to a different coin\u2019s wallet. __Conversions__ are handled by a built in market maker that automatically determines price based on a predetermined curve and issues orders fairly to all buy/sells within a block, with zero spread and the added benefit of eliminating the well- established problem of front-running, just some amount of slippage based on the net buy/sell.. With reserve currencies, buyers can make buys without even needing sellers (and vice versa). Amazingly, everything is done at the __protocol level__ on a decentralized network, meaning Verus and it's associated chains can't be censored or stopped.## Getting started: ### Important links:Website: [*https://verus.io*](https://verus.io) Wallet: [*https://verus.io/wallet*](https://verus.io/wallet) GitHub: [*https://github.com/veruscoin*](https://github.com/veruscoin) Explorer: [*https://explorer.verus.io*](https://explorer.verus.io) Discord: [*https://verus.io/discord*](https://verus.io/discord) Check [https://youtu.be/YVOfIMjRf30](Human Verification) if you only see one empty channel.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've got a few questions about using the Verus command line. How can I get a list of currencies that have markets for a specific pair of currencies, like BTC and ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` command to get a list of currencies that have markets for a specific pair of currencies. For example, to get a list of currencies that have BTC/ETH markets, you can use the following command:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\n\nThis command will return a list of currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that's really helpful. Another question I have is how can I send VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@) using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, you can use the following command:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n\nThis command will send 10 VRSCTEST from the address bob@ to the address alice@. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nWhat about converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC, using IDs as a funding source?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC, using IDs as a funding source, you can use the following command:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\n\nThis command will convert 10 VRSCTEST from the ID bob@ to VRSC-BTC. Do you have any other questions about currency conversion or the Verus command line?\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing. What are the different options that can be set when defining a currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen defining a currency in Verus, there are several options that can be set. These options include:\n\n* `OPTION_FRACTIONAL`: This option allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set.\n* `OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE`: This option makes it so that IDs may only be created by controlling ID if set.\n* `OPTION_ID_STAKING`: This option makes it so that all IDs on the chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking, if set.\n* `OPTION_ID_REFERRALS`: This option makes it so that the chain supports ID referrals if set.\n\nThese options can be used to customize the behavior of a currency in Verus.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been learning about VerusIDs, but I'm curious about other capabilities of Verus. What else can it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome additional capabilities of Verus include on-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, as well as on-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming. Verus also offers on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles. It's a very powerful and flexible platform.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. I've also heard about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain, either by advertising an offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT or posting the sale on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized manner, with the option to pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by the user. Payment can be accepted to either type of address, and transactions are executed directly, peer-to-peer without an intermediary. It's a very convenient and secure way to buy and sell digital assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really cool. I'm also wondering about security. I've heard of Verus Vault. What is it, and how does it protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows users to protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the funds cannot be spent until it is unlocked again. While locked, the funds can still be staked on the Verus network to earn rewards, and can still receive incoming funds. Note that enabling revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities requires a primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. A locked VerusID can be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which can circumvent the lock. It's a great way to add an extra layer of security to your funds.", "qa_tuples": [["What are some additional capabilities of Verus?", "Some additional capabilities of Verus include on-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, as well as on-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming.

Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.### Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning about currency launches on Verus. How can they raise funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrency launches on Verus can raise funds in three ways:\n\n1. Pre-launch discount: all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency.\n2. Pre-launch carve-out: a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies can be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.\n3. Pre-allocation: some of the newly launched currency can be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio.\n\nDo you have any follow-up questions about currency launches or fundraising on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. What's the difference between 100% backed currencies and fractionally backed currencies on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n100% backed currencies on Verus do not change their relative price to the underlying basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, take their funding from a percentage of the reserve backing. Except in the case of a new blockchain launch, which creates new native currency for operating the proof of stake of the blockchain, any currency that uses fundraising options will be a fractionally backed currency which will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it.\n\nDoes that help clarify the difference?

What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the Verus Desktop wallet, but I'm not sure how to enter commands. Can you help me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen entering commands in the Verus Desktop wallet, you need to enter `verus command \"<userinput>\"` literally, replacing `<userinput>` with your specific userdata. For example, if the text directs you to use `\"<Public Address>\"`, you would replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the actual address, so it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that helps. Now, I'm trying to convert a seed phrase into a Private key (WIF). What are the prerequisites for doing that in Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert your seed phrase into a Private key (WIF), you need to have a running native wallet first, that is fully synchronized.

Are you using the correct version of the wallet?\n\n**User:**\nI think so. Now, how do I actually convert my seed phrase into a Private key (WIF) in Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert your seed phrase into a Private key (WIF), go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner and enter the following command: `run convertpassphrase \"word_1 word_2 word_3... word_n\"`. Replace `Word1 word2 word3... word_n` with the actual seedphrase (12 or 24 words) of the address you want to import.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've got a few questions about using Verus. How can I convert VRSCTEST to a new reserve, BTC, through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC, using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to BTC through VRSC-BTC, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to BTC, using VRSC-BTC as the intermediate currency. Do you have any more questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How can I send VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo send VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\",\"amount\":10, \"exportto\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\"}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the specified address to PBaaSChain through the Bridge gateway. Do you have any more questions about cross-chain transactions?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. What about defining a currency in Verus? Are there any common options I should know about?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen defining a currency in Verus, there are several common options you might want to consider. These include:\n\n* `OPTION_FRACTIONAL`: allows reserve conversion using base calculations\n* `OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE`: sets permissionless ID creation or requires controlling ID permission\n* `OPTION_ID_STAKING`: sets staking to be based on ID ownership rather than value\n* `OPTION_ID_REFERRALS`: enables referrals on the chain\n* `OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED`: requires referrals on the chain\n* `OPTION_TOKEN`: sets the currency as a token rather than a native currency\n* `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY`: restricts the chain to a single currency (for PBaaS chains or gateways)\n* `OPTION_GATEWAY`: sets the currency as a gateway for external currencies\n* `OPTION_PBAAS`: defines the currency as a PBaaS chain\n* `OPTION_PBAAS_CONVERTER`: sets the currency as the default converter for a specific PBaaS gateway, publishing prices.\n\nThese are just a few of the options you can use when defining a currency in Verus.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in launching a currency on Verus. What features are available for doing so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides various features for launching a currency, including: automatic refunds if minimum participation is not met, maximum participation limits in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds, pre-launch discounts for early participants, and vesting schedules for pre-allocations using VerusIDs. These features should give you a good degree of control over your currency launch. Do you have any questions about how these features work, or would you like to know more about a specific one?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard about \"locking\" an ID on Verus. What's that all about, and how do I do it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLocking an ID on Verus involves setting a time lock or time delay on the ID using the `setidentitytimelock` command. This can be done using the `unlockatblock` parameter to define the unlock height of the identity, or the `setunlockdelay` parameter to define a delay in blocks before the ID unlocks. This allows you to control when an ID can be used or modified. Do you have any questions about how to use this feature, or scenarios where it might be useful?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What happens when an ID is revoked on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an ID is revoked on Verus, its locked status is cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height that may have been set. So, even if you had set a lock on an ID, revoking it will immediately clear that lock. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nOne last thing: how does Verus handle minimum participation for crowdfunding currency launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus allows for setting a minimum level of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on the chain.

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. #### Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**  The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\": <Unlock block height>}' ``` - **Time Delay:**  The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"setunlockdelay\": <Unlock block delay>}' ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ### Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about currencies launched on the Verus network. What are some of their features and capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrencies launched on the Verus network can be designed to accept a range of other currencies, and can have fractional reserve capabilities.

I've heard about the `sendcurrency` API, but I'm not sure about the difference between converting and preconverting funds using it. Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nConverting funds using the `sendcurrency` API involves converting funds from one currency to another that is already active on the network. Preconverting funds, on the other hand, involves converting funds to a new currency that is not yet active on the network, with the option to refund the original funds if the conversion is not successful. Does that clarify the difference?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense.

What did they introduce?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVersion 1.0.1 of the PBaaS protocol added new capabilities that extend the idea of a centralized currency to include the ability to launch temporarily centralized currencies, including those that can issue identities. These capabilities include:\n\n1. Minting of currency on demand by the identity of the currency as part of the `sendcurrency` command.\n2.

The capabilities basically extend the idea of a centralized currency to include the ability to launch temporarily centralized currencies, including those that can issue identities. This is achieved by setting the \u201cendblock\u201d on a centralized currency launch of either a token or liquidity basket, enabling:  1) Minting of currency on demand by the identity of the currency as part of the `sendcurrency`command.  2) Burning a liquidity basket currency, but instead of affecting the supply/reserve ratio as normal burns do, the identity of a centralized currency can also burn currency to affect the reserve ratio weights of the currency.  3) Registering identities on a currency. When an identity is registered on a centralized currency, the fee for the registration is not burned into the currency, but sent directly to the identity of the currency. This is true for token or liquidity basket currencies. For decentralized currencies, fees are burned, which on a liquidity basket, puts them into the liquidity pool for all LPs to share in earnings, and for a standard token, reduces the supply and available future registrations on that currency.  4) In v1.0.1, setting the endblock of a centralized currency causes all centralized capabilities of the same ID to end, converting it in whatever state it currently is in a decentralized currency with no special control over it after that occurs by any identity on the network.  5) v1.0.0 did not allow a decentralized non-liquidity token to register identities. v1.0.1 does.Thanks to ejuliano#8606 for suggesting the initial idea that led to the realization that these features could be added quite easily and with very little protocol risk. All of these new capabilities have had full coverage testing and validation over the past week thanks to @Asherda\u2019s leadership on that front.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

It's essential to stay up-to-date with the latest security patches, and we're committed to keeping Verus secure.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been testing on TestNet. What's the status of cross-chain notarization on TestNet after the latest release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWe're happy to report that cross-chain notarization has been re-enabled on TestNet with this release, after having been disabled due to issues with the auto-notarization protocol. We're always working to improve the stability and functionality of our features.\n\n**User:**\nI remember there were some issues with auto-notarization. What were they, exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWe encountered two issues: a notarization bug that caused notarizations to fork, and a problem with the protocol taking too long and generating too large proofs. These issues have been addressed and will be optimized in the next few days. We're committed to delivering a robust and efficient protocol.\n\n**User:**\nLastly, I'm interested in merge mining PBaaS chains with Verus or the Ethereum bridge to Goerli. What do I need to do going forward?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo merge mine PBaaS chains with Verus or the Ethereum bridge to Goerli going forward, you will need to update to v0.9.9-2, which is also the recommended version for mainnet. Make sure to update to the latest version to take advantage of the latest features and security updates.", "qa_tuples": [["What is an important update included in a recent version of Verus?", "This release includes an important update of the OpenSSL library, which addresses a buffer overflow vulnerability."], ["What is the status of cross-chain notarization on TestNet after the latest release?", "Cross-chain notarization has been re-enabled on TestNet with this release, after having been disabled due to issues with the auto-notarization protocol."], ["What issues were encountered with the auto-notarization protocol on TestNet?", "Two issues were encountered: a notarization bug that caused notarizations to fork, and a problem with the protocol taking too long and generating too large proofs.

Basically, we encountered two issues:1) There was a notarization bug in a significantly updated approach that caused notarizations to fork, effectively simulating a worst case, unmitigated attack on the notarization system. While that did not cause the system to fail per se, it resulted in the generation of many perceived, although not real, notarization forks on the network.2) Due to our effort to err on the side of more evidence than we believed was sufficient with auto notarization, then optimize to reduce the proofs required, the protocol was simply taking too long and generating too large proofs to be reasonable, required, or what we need on mainnet in any real scenario.As a result, we will take a few days to change some parameters in the auto notarization protocol that will both reduce the total and maximum amount of proof required, as well as provide a sufficient level of cryptographic proof, similar in strength to the current proof model with more efficient and selective proof choices. We don\u2019t expect this important step to take long, and until then, we will leave testnet on the pre-PBaaS to mainnet preparatory state.The good news is that since we have the new Verus Notification Oracle technology, we can enable everyone running on the current testnet to remain connected as all cross-chain transactions to and from PBaaS chains will resume flowing. We are still seeing an error in BridgeKeeper, but since this release includes a mainnet security update and addresses all other known issues on testnet, we\u2019ll release this immediately and update Bridgekeeper as soon as possible. In order to merge mine PBaaS chains with Verus or the Ethereum bridge to Goerli going forward, you will need to update to v0.9.9-2, which everyone should run for mainnet anyhow.Once you update, please feel free to resume merge mining all PBaaS chains and Verus.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was thinking about currency launches on Verus. How can they raise funds, and what is the effect on the currency's price?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrency launches on Verus can raise funds in three ways: pre-launch discount, pre-launch carve-out, and pre-allocation. These fundraising options create a currency that is not 100% backed and has a price that responds to market forces. The price of the currency will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it. Do you have any further questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What happens to the fundraising if a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met, no fundraising is received. The funds are simply refunded to the participants.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What's the purpose of a pre-launch discount in a currency launch on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA pre-launch discount in a currency launch on Verus provides a discount to all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block. This is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what's a pre-launch carve-out in a currency launch on Verus, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA pre-launch carve-out in a currency launch on Verus enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price-neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch. This allows the launching identity to receive a portion of the funds raised during the launch.\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing. How does pre-allocation work in a currency launch on Verus, and what is its effect on the reserve ratio?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPre-allocation in a currency launch on Verus enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price-neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time-locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods. This allows for a portion of the newly launched currency to be allocated to specific identities before it's available to the general public.\n\nI hope that answers all your questions about currency launches on Verus!

Each of these fundraising options creates a currency that is not 100% backed, and has a price that responds to market forces. 100% backed currencies do not change their relative price to the underlying basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, whether time-locked or not, take their funding from a percentage of the reserve backing. Except in the case of a new blockchain launch, which creates new native currency for operating the proof of stake of the blockchain, any currency that uses fundraising options will be a fractionally backed currency which will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it. If a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options that are not met, no fundraising is received:  - Pre-launch discount - all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about Verus PBaaS Reserve technology. What's the main benefit of using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main benefit of using Verus PBaaS Reserve technology is that it enables any organization of any size to create their own currency with its own blockchain, support it in world-class wallets, develop their own applications, and use it for payments worldwide that can be converted to the reserve currency without ever having to leave the blockchain network. It's a powerful tool for creating custom currencies and ecosystems.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. What's required to make a chain using Verus PBaaS Reserve technology?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo make a chain using Verus PBaaS Reserve technology, you need VRSCTEST in your wallet. Additionally, there are some requirements for the chain definition, such as a minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations, a minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization, and a maximum of 3 eras. These requirements help ensure the stability and security of the new chain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if the minimum contributions are not met when creating a new chain using Verus PBaaS Reserve technology?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the minimum contributions are not met when creating a new chain using Verus PBaaS Reserve technology, the chain will fail to start, and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to automate some tasks, and I was wondering, how do I schedule a script to run automatically at regular intervals?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can schedule a script to run automatically at regular intervals by adding it to your system's crontab. The crontab syntax is `m h dom mon dow command`, where `m` is the minute, `h` is the hour, `dom` is the day of the month, `mon` is the month, `dow` is the day of the week, and `command` is the command to run.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some of the commands in Verus. Can you tell me what the `getinitialcurrencystate` command does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getinitialcurrencystate` command in Verus returns the initial currency state for a specified chain or currency.

There are no actual protocol changes.The ETH bridge upgrade introduces the ability to enter notarizations between Ethereum Goerli and VRSCTEST using bridgekeeper without an Ethereum private key in your conf file. This will enable you to still mine and potentially earn by agreeing or disagreeing with notarizations mined into the Verus blockchain, without needing to make transactions on or spend Ethereum for fees. This should also work with a free Infura account.As a reminder, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services , using your metamask, converting or sending cross chain through the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about some recent updates to Verus. What new parameters were added in Verus v0.9.6, and what is their purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new parameters added in Verus v0.9.6 are `-arbitragecurrencies=[\u201cVRSCTEST\u201d,\u201dvETH\u201d]` and `-arbitrageaddress=valid R-address, pubkey, or ID`. These parameters are currently for testing and are preparing for an \"auto-arbitrage\" feature that will be available in the daemon before mainnet PBaaS activation.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What is the \"auto-arbitrage\" feature, and how will it benefit miners, stakers, blockchain users, and LPs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"auto-arbitrage\" feature combines decentralized on-chain marketplace offers for currency with liquidity basket import processing. This allows miners and stakers to commit funds from their node wallet in common currencies to spot and leverage guaranteed arbitrage opportunities when making a block. The benefits of this feature include:\n\n* Miners and stakers can capture guaranteed arbitrage opportunities and arbitrage with any currency they choose from their wallets.\n* Blockchain users can set limit orders and have them filled if they are near the market price for a currency, or if the market moves in their direction.\n* LPs and users of liquidity baskets for conversion get as close to market prices as possible on their conversions, never releasing funds from a basket before an on-chain, MEV-resistant auction takes place for the pricing of those assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great!

They are for testing right now, and are preparing for an \u201cauto-arbitrage\u201d feature already supported in the protocol, but which we hope to have in the daemon before mainnet PBaaS activation that combines decentralized on-chain marketplace offers for currency with liquidity basket import processing to provide miners and stakers the opportunity to commit some amount of funds from their node wallet in common currencies to spot and leverage guaranteed arbitrage opportunities when making a block. These opportunities arise between orders on chain and liquidity basket pricing that if leveraged to earn, actually result in P2P crowdsourcing of liquidity for all baskets across the network, both from the blockchain itself as well as miners and stakers, while benefiting all participants in the following ways: - Miners and stakers can capture guaranteed arbitrage opportunities and arbitrage with any currency that they choose from their wallets. - Blockchain users can set limit orders and have them filled if they are near the market price for a currency, or if the market moves in their direction. - LPs and users of liquidity baskets for conversion get as close to market prices as possible on their conversions, never releasing funds from a basket before an on-chain, MEV-resistant auction takes place for the pricing of those assets.Although this release is likely to be robust enough for a mainnet, we have come this far with quality and will not rush for a few days earlier upgrade.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a currency on Verus. What is the requirement for creating a currency with a specific name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency with a specific name, you need an ID of the same name, and the controller of that ID is the only one who can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once. Do you have any further questions about creating a currency on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nWhat do I need to create a currency of a specific name on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency of a specific name on Verus, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. Would you like to know more about the process of creating a currency on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nHow do I convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency, like GOLD?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency like GOLD, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. Do you have any more questions about converting currencies on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I define a currency called \"gold\" using the command line, which can be converted to with VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a currency called \"gold\" that can be converted to with VRSCTEST, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a currency called \"gold\" with the specified options and conversion rates. Do you have any further questions about defining a currency on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the requirements for launching a currency like \"gold\" in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a currency like \"gold\", the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command. Additionally, at least 1000 VRSCTEST must be preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.

Do you have any more questions about converting currencies on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I create a new token called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a new token called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nThis command defines a new token called \"mycoin\" with the specified options and conversion rates. Do you have any further questions about creating a token on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nWhat does it mean when `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new token?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new token, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID, which means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. Do you have any more questions about defining a token on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nHow do I define a currency on Verus, and what are the requirements for launching it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a currency on Verus, you can use the `definecurrency` command. For example, to define a currency called \"gold\", you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nTo launch the currency, the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command.

The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level. First, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' ``` of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches. After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]' ``` that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back. Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]' ``` In \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]' ```**Launching the testnet:** ``` ./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST ``` # Disclaimer", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about Verus's approach to currency conversions. How does Verus prevent front running during currency conversions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus prevents front running by processing all transactions in a group simultaneously, converting them at the same rate, and with no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. This ensures that all users get the same price for their conversions, regardless of the direction of the exchange. No one can take advantage of the system by getting a better rate than others.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! What about the fees for currency conversions on Verus? How do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe fee for currency conversions on Verus is 0.025%, which goes entirely to miners and stakers. Additionally, an implied volatility fee is planned to be implemented, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, to ensure that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers' risk with earnings from implied volatility fees.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also interested in launching a new currency on Verus. What features does Verus offer to support the launch of a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers several features to support the launch of a new currency, including: Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations. All of these features are specified in easy-to-understand commands and parameters, with no programming necessary.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds very flexible. What flexibility does Verus offer in terms of currency launch options?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus allows currencies to be launched with a range of options, including: accepting a range of other currencies, with or without fractional reserve capabilities, integration with other blockchains through the Verus import/export protocol, and automatic send/receive of Verus network tokens between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, with currencies sent between Verus and ETH expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.

While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees.

How do I configure the nheqminer to connect to a mining pool and mine to my address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo configure the nheqminer, you need to edit the `start.sh` file. You need to specify the pool host, port, your public VerusCoin address, worker name, and the number of threads to use. Make sure to use your own address and adjust the settings according to your needs. If you're not comfortable editing the file, you can also try using a mining software with a GUI.\n\n**User:**\nWhy is it important to limit the number of threads used by the miner?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt's important to limit the number of threads used by the miner to avoid overloading your system.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a PBaaS blockchain using Verus. What information do I need to provide to define the blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a PBaaS blockchain using Verus, you need to provide the following information:\n\n* The name of the chain\n* Options (an integer)\n* The currencies that the chain's native currency can be converted into\n* Conversion ratios between the chain's native currency and each currency on the chain\n* Era information, including block reward, reward decay, halving, and era end\n* A list of notaries (VerusIDs) on the chain\n* The minimum number of notaries required to confirm a block\n* Node information, including network addresses and node identities\n* Gateway converter name and issuance\n\nDo you have any questions about this process, or would you like more information on any of these points?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks. Now, how do I export an ID to a PBaaS chain using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo export an ID to a PBaaS chain using Verus, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\n\nThis command will export the ID to the specified PBaaS chain. Do you have any questions about this process, or would you like more information on how to use the `sendcurrency` command?\n\n**User:**\nWhat about signing transactions from multi-signature IDs in Verus? How does that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe process for signing transactions from multi-signature IDs in Verus involves the following steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction using the `sendcurrency` command and get the raw transaction data.\n2. Use the `z_getoperationstatus` command to get the raw hex transaction data.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and use the `signrawtransaction` command to sign the transaction.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command.\n\nThis process allows you to sign transactions from multi-signature IDs in a secure and decentralized manner. Do you have any questions about this process, or would you like more information on any of these steps?\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the `z_getoperationstatus` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getoperationstatus` command in Verus is used to get the raw hex transaction data after creating a transaction using the `sendcurrency` command. This raw hex transaction data is then used for signing the transaction by additional wallets containing the necessary signing addresses/IDs.\n\nIn the context of multi-signature IDs, `z_getoperationstatus` plays a crucial role in allowing you to sign transactions securely and decentralized.

On mainnet, destinations for such a transaction can include IDs, private addresses with memos to a z-address or ID:private, and transparent addresses. On testnet, such transactions can include all that is possible on mainnet as well as multiple currencies, currency conversions, and cross-chain sends.To our knowledge, this release raises the industry standard for multisig capability and its support on public blockchain protocols to a new level, even before considering the multisig revocation and recovery capabilities.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

This release also introduces a new smart transaction technology that is unique to the Verus network and replaces its use of Komodo compatible crypto-conditions. The Verus ID system was made possible through the use of Verus Smart Transactions, which will be available for everyone to use on their own blockchains in the upcoming PBaaS network upgrade. Verus Smart Transactions use standard Bitcoin style serialization rather than the ASN.1 used in crypto conditions, which makes support on lite or mobile wallets simpler to implement than the crypto-condition protocol, which is still used on the Verus network for Stake Guard. ## VerusHash 2.1 VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# Verus ID - A Better Blockchain Identity Technology If you\u2019ve been around crypto for even a little while, you\u2019ll start to hear things like \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d, \u201close your keys, lose your coins\u201d.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was wondering, how do currencies on Verus interact with other networks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrencies on Verus can be sent back and forth to other multi-currency capable networks, such as other independent PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s. Additionally, currencies on Verus can be defined as \"mapped currencies\", which map 1:1 to an existing currency on Ethereum, and can be sent from Ethereum with simple transactions and received and used as the new \"mapped currency\", or sent back to Ethereum and used there as the original currency. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat does, thanks! Another question I had is, what are the three ways that currency launches on Verus can raise funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrency launches on Verus can raise funds in three ways:\n\n1. Pre-launch discount: all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency.\n2. Pre-launch carve-out: a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies is carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price-neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.\n3. Pre-allocation: some of the newly launched currency is pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price-neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. What is the difference between 100% backed currencies and fractionally backed currencies on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n100% backed currencies on Verus do not change their relative price to the underlying basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, take their funding from a percentage of the reserve backing. These currencies will appreciate when more people convert to them and depreciate when more convert from them. Does that clarify the difference?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that helps. One last question. How do I reset my testnet on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your testnet on Verus, make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon is running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native). That should do the trick!", "qa_tuples": [["How do currencies on Verus interact with other networks?", "Currencies on Verus can be sent back and forth to other multi-currency capable networks, such as other independent PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s.

DAI), and can then be sent from Ethereum with simple transactions and received and used as the new \"mapped currency\", or sent back to Ethereum and used there as the original currency. - Currency launches can raise funds in 3 ways. Each of these fundraising options creates a currency that is not 100% backed, and has a price that responds to market forces. 100% backed currencies do not change their relative price to the underlying basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, whether time-locked or not, take their funding from a percentage of the reserve backing. Except in the case of a new blockchain launch, which creates new native currency for operating the proof of stake of the blockchain, any currency that uses fundraising options will be a fractionally backed currency which will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it. If a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options that are not met, no fundraising is received:  - Pre-launch discount - all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency. This is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live. - Pre-launch carve-out - this enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch. - Pre-allocation - this enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand Verus and its features. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how Verus ID signatures can be used in real-world applications. Do you have an example?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne example of how Verus ID signatures can be used is for journalists to sign photos, videos, and content, establishing a reputation for authenticity and countering the potential for deep-fakes to make the truth harder to find. Another example is for open source projects to create their own identities and digitally sign their binary releases, ensuring that files can be verified by hash and signature.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What benefits do Verus IDs offer in terms of quantum resistance?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, the plan is to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which will make it possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that Verus IDs are a fully decentralized protocol. What are some benefits of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome benefits of Verus IDs being a fully decentralized protocol include: anyone can create a Verus ID without permission, the creator of a Verus ID has complete, self-sovereign control over it, and all costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers, rather than a central authority.\n\n**User:**\nWhat exactly is a Verus ID, and how does it differ from other blockchain ID implementations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA Verus ID is a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, Verus IDs do not involve a corporation in the protocol. This means that anyone can create a Verus ID and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without permission.\n\n**User:**\nWhat features do Verus IDs provide in terms of identity applications?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs provide: quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network, the ability to receive and send funds controlled by single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself, the ability to change controlling addresses or single or multi-sig properties, which updates spend conditions and keys for future UTXOs, resistance to quantum attacks with known algorithms, and the ability to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, with the ability to revoke, recover, and inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the significance of digital signatures in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDigital signatures form the basis for any attestation of one party to the validity of another. They have numerous applications, including physical entry systems, workflow applications, and new earning opportunities. Digital signatures can be used to verify the authenticity of files, ensure the integrity of data, and establish trust between parties.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that asked before.

There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. Verus IDs provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, Verus ID provides:### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network Verus IDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so.

I've heard that some antivirus software flags the Verus software as a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program) because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these warnings.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. How can I verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus software download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus software download, you can follow these steps: \n\n1.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! We were discussing VerusIDs earlier. Now, I'd like to move on to tokens in the Verus network. Do you have any questions about how they work?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. How can tokens be used in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies. They can also be used for various purposes, such as payment models, tickets, point systems, etc. Additionally, tokens can be controlled by the blockchain or be partially blockchain controlled, centralized tokens, with currencies that are mintable at any time by the ID behind them.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What happens if the minimum participation is not met by the currency's start block during a token launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the minimum participation is not met by the currency's start block during a token launch, all participation will be refunded, less a minimal transfer/network fee, which was already allocated to miners/stakers. This ensures that participants aren't left with losses if the minimum participation isn't met.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What's the significance of the controlling ID behind a token?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe controlling ID behind a token can receive aggregated outgoing transactions to external systems that both burn coins and pass account data in the process. This allows applications to control currency supplies on the public network, whether these applications are external, decentralized networks or centralized custodial systems. It gives the controlling ID a lot of flexibility and control over the token.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really powerful. What's the advantage of using tokens in the Verus network for various use cases, such as club coins, game tokens, token launches, etc.?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe biggest advantage is that no programming is required to use tokens in the Verus network for various use cases, such as club coins, game tokens, token launches, etc. This makes it really easy to create and manage tokens for different purposes, without needing to be a developer or have extensive technical knowledge.", "qa_tuples": [["How can tokens be used in the Verus network?", "Tokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies.

Tokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies as well. Token launches can accept multiple other coins or tokens for conversion to the new token with payment to the token ID. Each token can have a different conversion price for pre-launch participation as well as minimums and maximums of participation.

While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about the TestNet protocols. Specifically, what are the main features of Version v0.7.1-5?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main features of Version v0.7.1-5 of the TestNet protocols include:\n\n1. Increased scale over previous versions.\n2. Ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency.\n3. Price-neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies.\n4. A new \"burn\" parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API, which allows for the official removal of a currency from its supply.\n\nWould you like to know more about any of these features?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How does the \"burn\" feature work in Version v0.7.1-5 of the TestNet protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"burn\" feature in Version v0.7.1-5 of the TestNet protocols allows for the official removal of a currency from its supply. When \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent (which must be a token or fractional currency) is permanently removed from its supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will increase the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any further questions about the \"burn\" feature?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's clear. What about conversion? How does that work in Version v0.7.1-5 of the TestNet protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Version v0.7.1-5 of the TestNet protocols, conversion is done in a way that prevents front running. All conversions are processed in one group of transactions, and all transactions in an aggregation of import blocks are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions. This means that all conversions are done at the same rate, with no spread between the conversion to and from a currency.\n\nDo you have any questions about conversion, or would you like to know more about fees associated with conversions?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, I do. What are the fees associated with conversions in Version v0.7.1-5 of the TestNet protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe fees associated with conversions in Version v0.7.1-5 of the TestNet protocols are:\n\n1. A fixed fee of 0.025% for conversions, which goes to miners and stakers.\n2. An implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions. This fee is intended to offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers' risk with earnings from implied volatility fees.\n\nDoes that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing: how do currency launches work in Version v0.7.1-5 of the TestNet protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrency launches in Version v0.7.1-5 of the TestNet protocols feature a Kickstarter-like system, where there are minimums to activate or automatically refund if not met. The launch pricing is dynamic, based on participation, and there are pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations.

This version also enables a new parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API called \"burn\".

In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.# An end to front running Conversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.# The Best Way to Launch a Currency Currency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. How can I assist you today?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that there was an issue with the liquidity basket that was recently fixed. What was the issue, and how does it affect the fees and conversions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! The issue was that the fees, including fractional fees on an exit from a liquidity basket, were not being burned before conversions took place. This meant that the person who exited with 100MM RaceCondition only received 14 VRSC instead of 15 VRSC. The fix ensures that fees are burned before conversions, resulting in a correct fee allocation and a 15 SAT price.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What lessons can be learned from liquidity basket management issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe lessons are to pay attention to the total reserve ratio, the currencies in the basket, and ensure there is enough liquidity of reserves and holder distribution for the basket to make sense. It's essential to understand how a basket works and have a reason before investing in it.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that there are plans to launch the ETH bridge soon. What is required for DeFi and cross-chain functions to be re-enabled, making the ETH bridge launch possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe network needs to upgrade to version 1.0.6 before DeFi and cross-chain functions can be re-enabled, making the ETH bridge launch possible.\n\n**User:**\nI've come across the term \"whales\" currency. What is it, and what is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"whales\" currency appears to be an ID registration currency that enables registering IDs with 3 levels of referrals. It collects registration fees, which may start reasonably priced and increase over time as fees are earned in the basket.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, what additional capabilities does Verus have that I should know about?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus has several additional capabilities. It allows for on-chain launches of token, centralized currency, and liquidity basket AMMs. It also enables on-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming. Additionally, Verus offers on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles.", "qa_tuples": [["What was the issue with the liquidity basket that was recently fixed, and how does it affect the fees and conversions?", "The issue was that the fees, including fractional fees on an exit from a liquidity basket, were not being burned before conversions took place.

This is because the correct fee allocation results in a 15 SAT price, which means the person who remains holding the RaceCondition bag would have only some 100s of thousands of SATs left in reserves. On the other hand, anyone could come in and reinflate the 5% currency by converting to it. This event on the network had the effect of reducing the extreme difference between supply and reserves on RaceCondition, and it will operate as a normal 5% reserve currency should when DeFi reactivates.The lesson here is that if you\u2019re interested to learn about a basket currency, pay attention to the total reserve ratio, what currencies are in it, and see that there is enough liquidity of reserves and holder distribution for the basket to make sense. Of course baskets could be memes, but they also have real function. Make sure you take a look into how a basket works and that you have a reason before putting your hard mined, staked, won, or purchased Verus in.We will need the network to upgrade to version 1.0.6 before we can re-enable DeFi and cross-chain functions, making the ETH bridge launch possible, as well as PBaaS launches and conversions.We see that someone is launching a currency called \u201cwhales\u201d, which looks like an ID registration currency that will enable registering IDs with 3 levels of referrals in a currency that simply collects registration fees, which may start quite reasonably priced and likely get more expensive over time as fees are earned in the basket. The startblock for whales is 2561900, which should happen somewhere around 6:00 UTC on Thursday. That means that if we can upgrade and activate by Tuesday before the meeting, that person would still have time for pre-launch participation by those who would like.Thanks everyone for upgrading as soon as you are able!### Additional Verus Capabilities - On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs - On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming - On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.

Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"options\":264,\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\"],\"conversions\":[1],\"eras\":[{\"reward\":1200000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0}],\"notaries\":[\"Notary1@\",\"Notary2@\",\"Notary3@\"],\"minnotariesconfirm\":2,\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.111:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node1@\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.112:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node2@\"}],\"gatewayconvertername\":\"Bridge\",\"gatewayconverterissuance\":1000000}' '{\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\",\"PBaaSChain\",\"USD\"],\"initialcontributions\":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],\"initialsupply\":3000000}'\n```\nDo you have any further questions about defining a PBaaS blockchain in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the limitations of creating a currency from an ID with a properly encoded i-address as its actual name in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, creating a currency from an ID with a properly encoded i-address as its actual name is not supported and can cause problems. This is because an i-address is used to calculate the ID based on its name registration, and using an i-address as a currency name can lead to confusion and errors. It is generally advised to avoid using i-addresses as currency names.\n\n**User:**\nWhy is it recommended to avoid using i-addresses as currency names in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsing an i-address as a currency name can lead to confusion and errors, as an i-address is used to calculate the ID based on its name registration. This can cause issues whenever an i-address or name may be used, and is not supported for creating currencies. To avoid user confusion, Verus is expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `definecurrency` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `definecurrency` command is used to define a new PBaaS blockchain and its properties, such as its name, options, currencies, conversions, eras, notaries, nodes, and gateway converter settings.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus consists of several components, including the name of the chain, options, currencies, conversions, eras, notaries, min notaries confirm, nodes, gateway converter name, and gateway converter issuance.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the key components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe key components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus include the name of the chain, options, currencies, conversions, eras, notaries, min notaries confirm, nodes, gateway converter name, and gateway converter issuance.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the override defaults for the bridge definition in a PBaaS blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe override defaults for the bridge definition in a PBaaS blockchain include currencies, initial contributions, and initial supply.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is a limitation to be aware of when creating a multi-currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne limitation to be aware of when creating a multi-currency in Verus is that you cannot make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. It is advised to avoid creating IDs with i-addresses as their names to prevent potential user confusion and problems.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the essential components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus consists of several essential components, including the name of the chain, options, currencies, conversions, eras, notaries, min notaries confirm, nodes, gateway converter name, and gateway converter issuance.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is an important limitation to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne important limitation to be aware of is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name (not its calculated ID).

How can I verify the integrity of the downloaded package?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the integrity of a downloaded Verus package, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. The package has been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\".\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command in the Verus CLI to verify the signature. Would you like me to explain how to use the `verifyfile` command?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please! How can I use the `verifyfile` command to verify the signature of a downloaded package?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `verifyfile` command to verify the signature of a downloaded package as follows:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <path_to_file>\n```\nReplace `<path_to_file>` with the path to the downloaded package file. This command will check the signature of the file and let you know if it's valid.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `listidentities` command, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. Can you tell me what information it returns?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listidentities` command returns a JSON object containing information about the identities that match the specified criteria. The returned object includes properties such as `identity`, `blockheight`, `txid`, `status`, `canspendfor`, and `cansignfor`. The `identity` object itself contains information like version number, flags, primary addresses, minimum signatures required, identity address, parent ID, name, content map, revocation authority, recovery authority, and timelock.\n\nDo you have any specific use cases in mind for the `listidentities` command, or would you like more information on how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do! I want to use it to find identities with a specific name. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `listidentities` command to find identities with a specific name by passing a JSON object as an argument, with a `name` property set to the desired name. For example:\n\n```\nverus listidentities '{\"name\" : \"myname\"}'\n```\n\nThis will return a list of identities with the name \"myname\". Give it a try and see how it works out!\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! Another question I have is about the `recoveridentity` command. What does the `returntx` argument do when using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `returntx` argument is a boolean that defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the `recoveridentity` command will return the signed transaction instead of sending it. This allows you to review and modify the transaction before sending it.\n\nDo you have any experience with the `recoveridentity` command, or would you like more information on how it works?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I'm not entirely sure what the `recoveridentity` command is used for. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `recoveridentity` command is used to recover a revoked identity in Verus. It takes several optional arguments, including `returntx`, `tokenrevoke`, `feeoffer`, and `sourceoffunds`, which allow you to customize the recovery process.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm looking into creating a currency definition, and I have some questions about the fields. What is the \"currencyidhex\" field in a currency definition, and how can it be used with the `getcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"currencyidhex\" field is a string that represents the hex representation of a currency ID. This field can be used with the `getcurrency` API by passing \"hex:currencyidhex\" as an argument. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about currency definitions?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I do. What do the \"startblock\" and \"endblock\" fields represent in a currency definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"startblock\" field represents the block number on the current chain that must be notarized into block one of the chain, while the \"endblock\" field represents the block number after which the chain's useful life is considered to be over. Do you have any more questions about these fields or would you like to know more about other fields in a currency definition?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. What do the \"initialsupply\", \"prelaunchcarveout\", and \"preallocations\" fields represent in a currency definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"initialsupply\" field represents the initial currency supply for fractional currencies before preallocation or issuance. The \"prelaunchcarveout\" field represents the pre-launch percentage of proceeds for fractional currency sent to the launching ID. The \"preallocations\" field is an array of objects that represents the VerusIDs and amounts for pre-allocation at launch. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that makes sense. What about the \"idregistrationfees\", \"idreferrallevels\", and \"idimportfees\" fields?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"idregistrationfees\" field represents the base cost of IDs for this currency namespace in this currency. The \"idreferrallevels\" field represents the levels of ID referrals, and is only applicable for native PBaaS chains and IDs. The \"idimportfees\" field represents the fees required to import an ID to this system, and is only applicable for native PBaaS chains and IDs. Do you have any more questions about these fields?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. What do the \"eras\" field represent in a currency definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"eras\" field is an array of objects that represents different chain phases of rewards and convertibility.

What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and I'm curious about its merge mining and multi-chain technology. What's the significance of it, and how will it impact the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology allows Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash. This means that multiple chains can earn rewards and be powered simultaneously, providing increased flexibility and scalability to the Verus network. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really powerful. I've also been playing around with the `sendcurrency` API and I was wondering how I can convert VRSCTEST to another currency, such as TESTCOIN, using it.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to another currency, such as TESTCOIN, using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"TESTCOIN\"}]'\n```\nReplace \"TESTCOIN\" with the currency you want to convert to. Have you tried it out?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I have.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help you with any questions about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in understanding the architecture of the Verus network. What's the architecture of the Verus network, and how does it enable unlimited simultaneous operation of interoperable blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network architecture is fractal, allowing for an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. This is possible because each blockchain on the network can operate independently, with its own features and currencies, while still being able to interoperate with other blockchains on the network. Would you like to know more about how this works or is there something else you'd like to ask?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Now, I'm curious about ID revocation. What happens when an ID is revoked, and how does it affect the locked status of the ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an ID is revoked, its locked status is cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height that may have been set. However, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. Does that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that makes sense. Now, I want to know more about the `sendcurrency` API. How can I send and convert funds on the Verus network using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds on the Verus network. The API allows you to specify the sender, recipient, amount, and currency, as well as any conversion options. For example, you can send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, or convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency. Do you have any specific use cases in mind or would you like more examples?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. What are the different types of locks that can be applied to an ID on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are two types of locks that can be applied to an ID on the Verus network: Time Lock and Time Delay. A Time Lock sets the unlock height of the identity, while a Time Delay sets a delay in blocks before the ID can be unlocked after its flags are set back to an unlocked state. Would you like to know more about how to apply these locks or is there something else you'd like to ask?\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a locked identity when it is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a locked identity is revoked, its locked status is cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height that was set.\n\n**User:**\nCan a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. Do you have any more questions about ID revocation or locks?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the `sendcurrency` API used for, and what are some examples of its usage?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API is used to send and convert funds on the Verus network. It can be used to send funds from one address to another, convert funds from one currency to another, and even preconvert funds to a new currency before it is active. Examples of its usage include sending VRSCTEST from one address to another, sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, and converting VRSCTEST to another reserve currency through a fractional currency. Would you like more examples or is there something else you'd like to ask?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I lock an ID on the Verus network, and what are the different types of locks available?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock an ID on the Verus network using the `updateidentity` command. There are two types of locks available: Time Lock and Time Delay. A Time Lock sets the unlock height of the identity, which means the ID will be locked until the specified block height is reached. A Time Delay sets a delay in blocks before the ID can be unlocked again after its flags are set back to an unlocked state. Would you like to know more about how to use these locks or is there something else you'd like to ask?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` API, and how can I use it to retrieve information about currencies on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. You can use it to retrieve information about currencies on the Verus network by specifying the currencies you're interested in, for example: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth`. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the concept of fractal blockchains in Verus, and how does it enable interoperability between multiple blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, the concept of fractal blockchains refers to the ability of the network to support an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. This is achieved through a fractal model, where each blockchain can have its own features and currencies, while still being able to interact with other blockchains on the network. This enables seamless interoperability between multiple blockchains, allowing for a high degree of flexibility and scalability. Would you like to know more about how this works or is there something else you'd like to ask?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus can be used to send and convert funds in various ways.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `getblock` command in Verus. Can you tell me what arguments it takes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblock` command in Verus takes two arguments:\n\n1. `\"hash|height\"`: a string representing the block hash or height, which is required.\n2. `verbosity`: an optional numeric argument with a default value of 1. It can be set to 0 for hex-encoded data, 1 for a JSON object, or 2 for a JSON object with transaction data.\n\nDo you have any questions about these arguments or how to use them?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks!

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you learn more about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about PBaaS chains, but I'm not entirely sure what they are or how they relate to the Verus chain. Can you enlighten me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) chain is a blockchain that runs from the same daemon as the Verus chain. This means that projects can join the Verus community in improving the daemon, and in doing so, they will have access to a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard about Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies. What are those, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA Verus DeFi fractional basket currency is a type of currency that can be defined by any ID owner, backed by one or more asset currencies at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a really powerful tool. I've also heard about simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches in Verus. What's the significance of those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches allow for the launch of a new blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This means that the bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nWow, that sounds really cool. One more thing I'm curious about - how do blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches work in Verus, and what features do they offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches allow for the setting of required minimum levels of worldwide participation in preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimum participation is not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and pre-launch discounts for early participants.

The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols. ## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity. ## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge) - Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to import an address with a lot of transactions into the GUI wallet, but it's taking forever. What should I expect when doing this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen importing an address with many transactions into the GUI wallet, you should expect a few things. First, the GUI wallet won't show any progress on the import, so it might seem like nothing is happening. You might also receive messages indicating that the RPC daemon is not reacting. Just be patient, as the import process will take a significant amount of time to complete in the background. It's a bit of a waiting game, but it'll get there eventually!\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, I guess. But why does importing a cryptocurrency address take so long to complete?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe import process takes a long time to complete because it has to process a large number of transactions associated with the address being imported. This can be a time-consuming process, especially if the address has a high transaction volume. It's like trying to sift through a huge pile of data, one transaction at a time!

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm really new to all this. Maybe it's a bit basic, but, what is VerusCoin?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusCoin is a decentralized public blockchain project that is open-source, community-driven, and had a fair launch without an ICO. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about VerusCoin or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, I do. What kind of privacy features does VerusCoin have?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusCoin has Sapling-enhanced privacy features, which include zk-SNARKs zero-knowledge proofs, allowing for secure and private transactions. This means you can send and receive VerusCoin without worrying about your transactions being traced or monitored. Do you have any more questions about VerusCoin's privacy features?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question I had was, what is VerusHash, and what makes it unique?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash is the mining algorithm used by VerusCoin. It's a PoW/PoS hybrid algorithm that is 50/50 Proof of Power, making it 51% attack-resistant. It's also CPU-targeted, non-discriminatory, and equalizes CPU and FPGA mining capabilities. This means that anyone can mine VerusCoin, regardless of their hardware, and it's much more secure than traditional PoW algorithms.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the total supply of VerusCoin, and is there a premine or ICO?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe total supply of VerusCoin is 83,540,184 VRSC, with no premine and no ICO. This means that the entire supply of VerusCoin was mined fairly, without any unfair advantages to early adopters or investors. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of VerusID. What is it, and what makes it unique?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusID is a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides a decentralized identity system. It's unique in that it's not controlled by a corporation, unlike most blockchain ID implementations, and offers opportunities for identity applications. VerusID is a powerful tool for managing your digital identity and assets. Do you have any more questions about VerusID?\n\n**User:**\nFinally, how can I mine VerusCoin?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can mine VerusCoin using CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, solo, or in pools. There are also various mining software available, such as ccminer and nheqminer, that support VerusCoin mining. If you're interested in mining, I can provide you with more detailed instructions and resources to get you started.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHi! I was wondering, what is the `getcurrencyconverters` API used for in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example, `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold. Do you have any other questions about this API or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! Another question: how can I lock an ID using the `updateidentity` API in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock an ID by setting the `flags` to 0 and specifying the `timelock` parameter, which defines the unlock height of the identity. Here's an example: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'`. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that does. Thanks for explaining! What about the `getcurrencyconverters` API again? How can I use it to retrieve all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve and meet certain reserve ratio and currency listing requirements?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that meet the specified requirements. Here's an example: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the Verus network, and how does it support interoperability between blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network is a decentralized network that allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can be easily set up with bridging of public currencies into an organization's internal private network and back. Does that help clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nYes, thanks! What is the concept of time locking in Verus, and how does it relate to IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, time locking is a feature that allows you to lock an ID until a specific block height (unlock height) or with a specific delay (time delay) before unlocking. This can be done using the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. Additionally, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the warning about testnet coins/currencies in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset.\n\n**User:**\nHow do time locks work in Verus IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTime locks in Verus IDs can be used to lock an ID until a certain block height is reached (using the `timelock` parameter) or to delay an ID's unlock by a certain number of blocks when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**User:**\nHow does the Verus network handle the operation and interoperability of multiple blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network operates on a fractal model, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. While there is some overhead for cross-notarization, the network can support an unlimited number of blockchains without any limitations.\n\n**User:**\nCan a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**User:**\nHow can you use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds by specifying the sender's address, recipient's address, currency, and amount. You can also use it to send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the main advantage of the Verus network in terms of blockchain creation and interoperability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, with no limit on the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the network. This is achieved through decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation provided by Notary IDs.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of a Notary ID in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA Notary ID provides decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which can be easily set up with bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back.\n\n**User:**\nHow do you lock an ID using the Verus command line, and what does the `timelock` parameter define in this context?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo lock an ID, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter. The `timelock` parameter defines the unlock height of the identity, specifying the block height at which the ID will be unlocked.\n\n**User:**\nHow do you send and convert funds using the `sendcurrency` API in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds. You can specify the sender and recipient addresses, the currency to be sent, and the amount to be sent. You can also use the `*` wildcard to send from all private wallet funds. Additionally, you can convert funds by specifying the currency to be converted to.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a locked identity when it is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRevoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I send and convert funds using the `sendcurrency` API in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to assist you with any questions about Verus. What would you like to know today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand more about VerusIDs. What's the purpose of a locked VerusID, and how does it provide protection against unauthorized access?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGreat question! A locked VerusID provides an additional layer of security against unauthorized access by requiring a predetermined unlock time before funds can be spent or accessed. During this time, the revocation and recovery authority identities can revoke and recover the ID if an unauthorized unlock occurs, preventing theft or loss of funds. This feature protects against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" and provides a decentralized solution for fund recovery.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also heard about Verus Vault. What are some of the additional features and use cases of Verus Vault, beyond just protecting and recovering funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault not only protects and recovers funds but also provides security for IDs and NFTs. It also enables time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This feature set allows users to preserve their blockchain wealth and assets across generations.\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the testnet and I think I messed something up. How do I reset my Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your Verus testnet, follow these steps:\n\n1. Close Verus and ensure no testnet daemon is running.\n2.

Verus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer the first worldwide verifiable, decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft. Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity. Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables. It is also the foundation upon which many new applications and additional capabilities can be built. For example, using Verus ID signatures, it\u2019s possible for any journalist anywhere to sign photos, videos, and content, establish a reputation for authenticity, and counter the potential for deep-fakes to make the truth harder to find. Open source projects can now create their own identities and digitally sign their binary releases, ensuring that not only can a file be verified by hash as the one downloaded from a particular server, but by signature as the actual file initially signed by the developer or release engineer. Signatures also form the basis for any attestation of one party to the validity of another. In fact, there are so many applications for digital signatures, from things listed already, to physical entry systems, to workflow applications, to new earning opportunities that a full discussion of use cases would overwhelm these release notes. In any case, we are happy to release digital signatures for all, and we hope you enjoy using this new, simple capability, maybe even think of a new use case you\u2019d like to pursue yourself as a business opportunity on the Verus Network!", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/signatures.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the implied volatility fee. What is it, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe implied volatility fee is a fee that will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions. It's intended to ensure that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers' risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. The fee will be higher for blocks that change the price of a currency significantly, and lower for currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How does Verus make it easy to launch a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus makes it easy to launch a new currency by providing a Kickstarter-like system with minimums to activate or automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations. All of these features are specified in easy-to-understand commands and parameters, with no programming necessary.\n\n**User:**\nWhat features are available for currencies launched on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrencies launched on the Verus network can accept a range of other currencies and can be launched with or without fractional reserve capabilities. Additionally, the Verus import/export protocol makes it easy to integrate with other blockchains, and external bridges are in progress to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens.\n\n**User:**\nI was still curious about the implied volatility fee. What is its purpose, and how will it be charged?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe implied volatility fee is intended to offset the potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers' risk. It will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee. This fee will be used to ensure that relatively volatile currency baskets offset the risk with earnings from implied volatility fees, while less volatile currency baskets will have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers.\n\n**User:**\nHow can a currency be launched on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA currency can be launched on the Verus network with a Kickstarter-like minimum to activate, or if not met, automatically refund.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand more about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI have some questions about Verus identities. What happens if a new address type or signature algorithm is added to the Verus blockchain, and an identity is updated to use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure, is added to the Verus blockchain, and an identity is updated to use it, all transactions sent to that identity that are updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well. This means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. Can you tell me more about the components of an identity in Verus and their roles?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach identity in Verus has three key components: the primary, revocation, and recovery authorities. The primary is the self-identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent (which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined), and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified. The revocation identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity. The recovery authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand. What is the relationship between an identity and a currency address in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, an identity and a currency address are one and the same. This means that your friendly name can be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer.\n\n**User:**\nSo, what are the components of an identity in Verus, and what are their roles?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAn identity in Verus consists of a set of addresses (one or more), a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity, and three authorities: the primary, the revocation, and the recovery authorities. The primary is the self-identity, which can modify any part of the identity except its name, parent, and data under the control of the other authorities. The revocation identity can revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control. The recovery authority can redefine/recover a revoked identity, but cannot change the revocation authority or modify an unrevoked identity.\n\n**User:**\nHow can identities be transferred in Verus, and what happens to the associated funds and authorities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIdentities can be transferred by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party's control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so. All funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred.\n\n**User:**\nSo, what happens to transactions sent to an identity when a new address type or signature algorithm is added to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure, is added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well.

Each identity must have a set of addresses (1 or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. Each identity also refers to two additional identities that have authority over:   - **Primary** - this is the self identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.   - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.   - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all. 3. Identities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party\u2019s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so. 4. If an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using `z_getbalance identity@\u201d`. 5.

How do I go about verifying the signature of the downloaded archive?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the signature of a downloaded Verus archive, you need to:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command in the CLI to perform the verification. Do you have any questions about the verification process?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's clear. What identity is used to sign the Verus downloads?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus downloads are signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". This ensures that the downloads are authentic and come from a trusted source.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What result should I expect if the signature verification is successful?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of a successful signature verification using the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command is `true`. This indicates that the downloaded archive is authentic and has not been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that I should upgrade to CLI version v0.7.2-8. What's the importance of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUpgrading to CLI version v0.7.2-8 is considered MANDATORY, and all node operators should update as soon as possible. This version includes critical updates and fixes that are essential for the security and stability of the Verus network. It's crucial that you upgrade to ensure the continued health of the network and to avoid any potential issues.", "qa_tuples": [["What is the purpose of the txt file included with each Verus download?", "The txt file included with each Verus download contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, which allows users to verify the authenticity of the download."], ["How do I verify the signature of a downloaded Verus archive?", "To verify the signature of a downloaded Verus archive, you need to:\n\n1.

In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well.This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever released, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it\u2019s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel.

How can I assist you today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about Verus version v0.7.1-3. What are its main features, and is it considered hardened for mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVersion v0.7.1-3 of Verus has several key features, including increased scale over previous versions, the ability to apply fractional and centralized attributes to a currency, and the introduction of currency burn functions. However, this version is not yet considered hardened for mainnet.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What about the \"burn\" parameter in the \"sendcurrency\" API? What's its purpose, and how does it affect the currency's supply?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"burn\" parameter in the \"sendcurrency\" API allows a currency to be officially removed from its supply. If \"burn\" is set to 1, the currency sent (which must be a token or fractional currency) is removed from circulation. In the case of a fractional currency, this will increase the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How does the conversion process work in Verus, and what fees are associated with it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, all transactions in an aggregation of import blocks are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and converted at the same rate, with no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. This means that all users exchanging currencies will get the same price in each direction. There is a fee of 0.025% for conversions, which goes entirely to miners and stakers. Additionally, an implied volatility fee is planned to be introduced, which will vary based on the imbalance of transactions in a block and will help offset the risk of impermanent loss for liquidity providers.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also interested in launching a currency in Verus. What features are available, and do they require programming knowledge?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers a range of features for launching a currency, including Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations.

This allows price neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. This version also enables a new parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API called \"burn\". If \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent, which must be a token or fractional currency is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.# An end to front running Conversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.# The Best Way to Launch a Currency Currency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.The initial price in reserve at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the early blocks that will come in as reserve currency. All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve. A currency with a reserve of 0.1 or 10% will rise or fall fairly quickly when converted to or from, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit.**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:** ``` ./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN ``` On first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a new currency using Verus. What are some of the features of the launch options?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe launch options for a new currency using Verus provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Additionally, using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations. Does that help? Do you have any further questions about launching a new currency?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what are its benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. This enables public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to set up with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. Does that make sense? \n\n**User:**\nI was also wondering about ID management. How can I lock and unlock an ID using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock and unlock an ID using the `setidentitytimelock` command. To set a time lock, you can specify the unlock height of the identity using the `unlockatblock` parameter. To set a time delay, you can specify how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state using the `setunlockdelay` parameter. Note that revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height, and a locked identity cannot revoke itself. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question I had was about currency conversion. What is the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves.

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. ### Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**  The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\": <Unlock block height>}' ``` - **Time Delay:**  The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"setunlockdelay\": <Unlock block delay>}' ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ### Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about Verus Coin 0.4.0, what are some of the key fixes in this version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the key fixes in Verus Coin 0.4.0 include a fix to an issue where the pool may exceed getblocktemplate's ability to keep up with the work queue when the network is under stress, a fix to the Verus bash script to allow execution from external directories, and improved Komodo compatibility. Do you have any other questions about Verus Coin 0.4.0?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I've heard about Sapling in Verus Coin 0.4.0, what is Sapling, and what are its benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSapling is a new address and transaction type in Verus Coin 0.4.0 that offers several benefits, including memory usage reduction of near 98% and performance improvements of typically 40-50x over previous z-transactions. Sapling is a significant upgrade to the Verus protocol, and we're excited about its potential.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about Crypto-conditions and StakeGuard in Verus Coin 0.4.0? I've heard those terms thrown around, but I'm not sure what they mean.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCrypto-conditions in Verus Coin 0.4.0 is a technology that enables smart transactions and new types of on-chain functionalities. Verus has enhanced the original crypto-condition technology to make integration with standard transactions easier and enable things like StakeGuard, the Verus nothing-at-stake solution.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to send money to another Verus identity using the command line.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send money to another Verus identity using the `z_sendmany` or `sendtoaddress` commands. For example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ '[{\"address\":\"alice@\", \"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100\n```\n\nDo you have any more questions about sending money with Verus?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that helps. I was also curious about how the registration fee for a new identity in Verus is distributed.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without a referral or 80 VRSC with a referral, is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows: 20 VRSC to the referrer's ID, 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's ID, 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID, and 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined. 100% of all funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What are the two steps involved in making a Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe two steps involved in making a Verus ID are:\n\n1. Committing to a friendly name: This step registers your commitment to a name, but keeps the name secret until you register it and reveal your commitment.\n2. Registering the name: This step requires paying a fee of 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST with a referral) and reveals your commitment to the name.\n\nDo you have any more questions about creating a Verus ID?\n\n**User:**\nWhy are the two-step process of committing and registering a name necessary?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe two-step process is designed to prevent \"name front running\", where a selfish miner could replace your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead.\n\n**User:**\nI see. How does the referral system work when creating a Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen creating a Verus ID, you can use a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the registration fee is reduced to 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. The referral funds are distributed as follows:\n\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined\n\nAll funds not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to the funds that are not paid to referrers when registering a Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n100% of the funds that are not paid to referrers go to the miners or stakers of the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the benefit of having a Verus identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nHaving a Verus identity makes it easier to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. This means that you can use a name like \"bob@\" instead of a long, complicated address.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I make a new Verus identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMaking a new Verus identity requires two steps: committing to a name and registering the name. Committing to a name registers your commitment to a specific name, but keeps the name secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. Registering a name requires paying a fee of 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity, in which case the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of committing to a name before registering it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of committing to a name before registering it is to prevent \"name front running\", where a selfish miner could replace your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead.\n\n**User:**\nHow are the funds distributed when registering an identity with a referral?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen registering an identity with a referral, the funds are distributed as follows: 20 VRSC to the referrer's ID, 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's ID, 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID, and 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined. The remaining funds go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nHow much does it cost to register an identity, and how is the cost affected by having a referral?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRegistering an identity costs 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST without a referral, and 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST with a referral.

Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ \u2018[{\u201caddress\u201d:\u201dalice@\u201d, \u201camount\u201d:100}]\u2019 ``` or ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100 ``` Making a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. To prevent this name \u201cfront running\u201d, you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows:- 20 VRSC to the referrer\u2019s ID - 20 VRSC to the referrer\u2019s referrer\u2019s ID - 20 VRSC to the referrer\u2019s referrer\u2019s referrer\u2019s ID - 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined100% of all funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.## To create an identity:", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering, what does the `gettxoutsetinfo` command do in Verus, and what information does it return?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `gettxoutsetinfo` command in Verus returns statistics about the unspent transaction output set. It may take some time to execute. The result is a JSON object containing the following information:\n\n* `height`: The current block height (index)\n* `bestblock`: The best block hash in hexadecimal format\n* `transactions`: The number of transactions\n* `txouts`: The number of output transactions\n* `bytes_serialized`: The serialized size of the data\n* `hash_serialized`: The serialized hash of the data\n* `total_amount`: The total amount of value in the unspent transaction output set\n\nDo you have any other questions about the `gettxoutsetinfo` command or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What is the purpose of the `kvsearch` command in Verus, and what information does it return?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `kvsearch` command in Verus is used to search for a key stored via the `kvupdate` command on an asset chain. The command returns a JSON object containing information about the key, including:\n\n* `coin`: The chain the key is stored on\n* `currentheight`: The current height of the chain\n* `key`: The key being searched for\n* `keylen`: The length of the key\n* `owner`: The hex string representing the owner of the key\n* `height`: The height the key was stored at\n* `expiration`: The height the key will expire\n* `flags`: A flag indicating whether the key was created with a password (1) or not (0)\n* `value`: The stored value associated with the key\n* `valuesize`: The amount of characters stored in the value\n\nDo you have any other questions about the `kvsearch` command or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nI have one more question.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey, I was wondering about the warranty and liability associated with using Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. So, essentially, you're using Verus at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for clarifying that. I saw a test software release, what's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis is a test release intended to be used with test chains. It is not recommended to use it for mainnet. Do not use it as a main wallet. It's for testing purposes only, so don't use it for any serious transactions.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. How do I define a chain using the command line and Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a chain, you can use the `definechain` command with the following format:\n```\n./komodo-cli -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [{\"reward\" : 10000000000}], \"notarizationreward\" : 1440000000, \"billingperiod\" : 1440, \"nodes\" : [{\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2500\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"\"}, {\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2501\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"RDyDzC5JB66Y29fzBkamywqEn1PJXTzj8B\"}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a new chain with the specified properties, such as name, eras, notarization reward, billing period, and nodes.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! How do I connect to a defined chain using the command line and Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo connect to a defined chain, you can use the following command:\n```\n./komodod -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\nThis command connects to the specified chain, and on first connection, a local config file is created. Note that VRSCTEST will not be needed to run to connect, but it will be needed to merge mine.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question, where are the config files for PBaaS chains stored?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe config files for PBaaS chains are stored in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME` directory, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain.

In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well.This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever released, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it\u2019s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet.

The protocol change makes the following adjustments:Conversions and cross-chain transfers still roll-up into exports that are collected from one or more blocks of transfer transactions, but to determine when a block is the last of the prior export or first in the next requires a random bit pulled from later blocks. The last miner or staker to complete a block of an export retroactively receives 10% of all fees from processing that export, including all conversions, once the rollup is processed as an import. This reward used to go to the miner or staker who processes the export, which is no longer the case. Import transactions can now include up to n/2 arbitrage transactions, where n is the number of reserves in a liquidity basket currency.These changes together serve to disincentivize any miner or staker from attempting to exclude a large set of transactions from a block and front run all of them, as they will have an even chance of having all of those excluded transactions put back in with their transaction, turning potential gain into potential loss. They would be better off saving their working capital to arbitrage imports by joining transactions, bringing them close to market, and earning money without risk of loss. In addition, if they do end up putting more value of transactions in a block that caps the export rollup, they will reliably earn meaningful rewards without risk of loss in that way as well.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

Thanks @Himu007 for the PR! There are no mainnet protocol changes in v0.9.9-3 over the prior release.### What\u2019s New for TestNet This release includes an activation that allows a major upgrade to the testnet Ethereum bridge contracts that is both not expected to be needed again on testnet and not ever needed on mainnet with the new contract upgrade model. This upgrade should clear all known issues on the bridge to Goerli, meaning any remaining bridge transactions will be delivered, and the ETH bridge should then be fully functional.### The Path for PBaaS to Mainnet This testnet has actually been through a lot already, more than we expected before mainnet, and this last experience, along with its full restoration of cross-chain and all function has been very useful and was the impetus for the Verus Oracle Notification technology. In the process of getting here, we implemented the necessary changes and fixes to get everything back on track, but we also have remnants of these events in the daemon, and on the final protocol, these are there to enable compatibility with the history of testnet, not because we need these upgrades on mainnet PBaaS. It gave us experience, increased confidence, and pushed us to develop a fast, decentralized network response capability. At the same time, it would be best for our code base, both on the Verus side and in the ETH contracts if that testnet history is removed from the code before mainnet activation. Doing so would make the next upgrade incompatible with today\u2019s testnet and its earlier history.As a result, we have decided that we will create one final testnet, but this time, we would do it a little differently than in the past. We will extend the pre-PBaaS upgrade on the existing testnet to a future date via the oracles.

Verus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer the first worldwide verifiable, decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft.Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

Version 0.4.0g includes all improvements in 0.4.0f and an expiry on stake transactions to allow deletion from wallets later Version 0.4.0f includes all improvements in 0.4.0e. In addition, it provides more detail about stake (winner of the contest) and mint (staked reward) transactions in Agama GUI as well as CLI listtransactions. It also introduces safeguards against any possibility of double staking behavior caused by forks and reorgs and the ability to set the maximum number of transparent and private transactions in Agama in settings->App config. 0.4.0e fixes issues and introduces a much cleaner view of staking transactions and minted coinbases in the Agama GUI. The following community reported issues are resolved: 1. Coinbase shielding problems to Sapling and sometimes to Sprout private addresses are resolved 2. Staking will again default to sending the coinbase to the address that staked the reward unless **-pubkey=66charpubkey** is set. The public key of an address where you would like the coinbases to go can be determined using **\"validateaddress\"** either in the CLI or GUI. 3. Agama GUI no longer shows ins and outs or multiple lines for a staking transaction. Instead, it now displays an easy to understand single line for each \"stake\" transaction and also easily distinguishes between mined and minted coinbases once they are mature. ## 0.4.0c - released 10/29/2018", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was wondering about wallet security. What's the importance of regularly backing up your wallet.dat file, especially if you have timelocked coins?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExcellent question! Regularly backing up your wallet.dat file is crucial if you have timelocked coins because you will need to keep your wallet.dat file secure for a long, long time. This is because your wallet.dat file contains information about your timelocked coins, and if you lose it, you will not be able to access those coins. So, it's essential to make regular backups to ensure you can recover your wallet and access your timelocked coins in the future.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in staking with Verus. How do I start staking with Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo start staking with Verus, you'll need to use VRSCs that are not time-locked, stored in a public and transparent wallet, and are at least 150 blocks old (approximately 2.5 hours). Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about staking with Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually, I do. How is the chance of winning a block determined in Verus staking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe chance of winning a block in Verus staking is determined by the ratio of your coins in your public and transparent wallet to the total staking supply in public and transparent wallets. It's a fair and transparent system that gives everyone an equal opportunity to stake. Do you have any more questions about staking with Verus?\n\n**User:**\nHow often are staking rewards distributed in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nStaking rewards are distributed approximately every minute in Verus, with an average of 720 staking rewards per day. You can expect to receive rewards frequently, which is one of the benefits of staking with Verus.\n\n**User:**\nDoes hash power influence staking rewards in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, hash power does not influence staking rewards in Verus. Verus uses a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, which means that the chance of winning a block is based on the amount of coins you have, not your hash power. This makes it more accessible and energy-efficient.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen a message in the Verus debug.log that says \"No eligible staking transaction found.\" What does that mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe message \"No eligible staking transaction found\" in the Verus debug.log means that you are staking, but have not received a reward yet. It's a normal message and doesn't indicate any issues with your staking setup.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to time-locked coins in Verus, and how can I use them for staking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTime-locked coins in Verus must be sent to a private address and then to a public and transparent address before they can be used for staking or making transactions. Once the coins lose their time lock, you can unlock them by transferring them from your private address back to your public and transparent address, and you will automatically start staking. It's a simple process, and you'll be able to use your time-locked coins for staking in no time.

You'll start staking with the first VRSCs that are not time locked + in your public / transparent wallet + 150 blocks old (or about 2.5 hours). Your chances to win a block: Your coins in your public/transparent wallet / Total staking supply in public/transparent wallets (which is max. about 485.000 VRSC from the first (sunrise) week as long as the rewards were below 192) Remember: There will be only one reward every minute. It\u2019s going to be either mining or staking, so on average 720 mining and 720 staking rewards every day. Example: I have 300 coins in a public/transparent address / 300.000 in public wallets (let's assume some part is lost/not staking or in private wallets), so that would be 1/1000 x 720 of a chance or around average 1,4 days for a staking block rewards.

It means that you are staking but have not received a reward yet. @miketout will change the message soon. Regarding time locked coins: The Zcash protocol requires you to send all coins received by mining (on wallet, not pool mining) or staking (reward transactions, also on wallet, not pool staking) once unlocked to a private address and then to a public/transparent address before you can use them either for staking or for making transactions (that\u2019s how you make use of your rewarded coins = coinbase coins).

This fault while running is only caused by non-typical API, insight explorer, or CLI use, but if it does happen, may result in the need to rescan or resync your wallet. We know of no one on mainnet affected by this issue. We recommend that all users upgrade.This release also includes a new capability for testnet, which was pioneered by CHIPS developer @Biz, who worked to modify and test the Verus PoP algorithm to support 10 second block times, which the CHIPS chain uses to enable its game application focus. These new parameters will enable the CHIPS blockchain to move to being an interoperable, merge mineable PBaaS chain with a 10 second blocktime when PBaaS goes live on mainnet. To learn how to test the new CHIPS test chain on testnet, visit the #pbaas-development channel, as the support in v0.9.4-5 is not as complete as it will be in the next and hopefully final testnet reset. In that next version, blocktime and the pow averaging window for any PBaaS chain\u2019s PoP consensus will be able to be configured between 10 seconds and 2 minutes in addition to its notarization frequency as part of the chain definition, enabling a greater variety of PBaaS use cases, transaction throughput, and application capabilities.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

While the current deadline for being upgraded is in 1 week, it is a soft fork that we would like to activate as soon as possible, and if we can believe that we have more than 50% of the validating network updated earlier than 1 week, we will trigger the activation with our Oracle Notification Technology described in 2. **(Mainnet + Testnet)**2. **Enabling Seamless Decentralized Network Upgrades**: This release includes a Verus invention of consensus-capable oracle notifications built into the core protocol, which enable dynamic coordinated consensus changes that can be triggered at a time decided after the actual release which enables them, all without any compromise on decentralization. The Verus Community may decide that we are ready to go earlier than one week on this upgrade and activate it, even before its scheduled time. The good news is that this first test upgrade will primarily affect testnet and prepare for the mainnet PBaaS upgrade, so it is a perfect test case for a mainnet test run before we #LaunchPBaaS. This release actually has the ability to upgrade mainnet to PBaaS, but we believe it is prudent to have at least some time on this new protocol on testnet before the v1.0 release, which will upgrade mainnet. If we make no additional changes to the protocol in this release, which we do not intend to do at this time, this version may be able to follow the v1.0 upgrade. If we determine that it cannot, the oracle upgrade technology will enable the daemon to recognize that it is not capable and request that the user upgrade to a newer version without requiring a bootstrap for the upgrade. **(Mainnet + Testnet)**3. **This upgrade fixes all known testnet issues with no reset**: Using v0.9.9, you should be able to sync fully and resume all cross-chain operations on the Verus test network, if you were not able to perform cross-chain operations or sync to the network on the prior version. As mentioned, someone seems to have mined with an intermediate version along the way on testnet and made the network unavailable without a bootstrap on the older daemon. This version should fix that issue as well as any cross-chain difficulties. Auto-notarization will be enabled on testnet in sync when the testfork executes. Until then, all witnessed cross-chain operations should be able to resume, if they have had difficulty. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to verify a signature using Verus. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify a signature using Verus by running the following command:\n```\nverus verifymessage \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" \"signature\" \"my message\"\n```\nReplace `\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\"` with the address that signed the message, `\"signature\"` with the signature to verify, and `\"my message\"` with the original message. Did you have any questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. I think I can handle that. What about the `updateidentity` command? What's that used for in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `updateidentity` command is used to update an identity in Verus. It takes several arguments, including a JSON object describing the identity, and optional parameters for returning the transaction, updating the token, offering a fee, and specifying the source of funds. Would you like to know more about the JSON object used with this command?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please. What information can be included in the JSON object used with the `updateidentity` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe JSON object used with the `updateidentity` command can include several pieces of information, such as:\n\n* Version number (optional)\n* Flags (required)\n* Primary addresses (required)\n* Minimum signatures required (required)\n* Identity address (optional)\n* Parent ID (optional)\n* Identity name (required)\n* Content map (optional)\n* Revocation authority (optional)\n* Recovery authority (optional)\n* Timelock (optional)\n* Private address (optional)\n\nLet me know if you'd like more information about any of these fields.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks. What about the `returntx` parameter in the `updateidentity` command? What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `returntx` parameter in the `updateidentity` command determines whether the command returns the transaction ID or the signed transaction. If `returntx` is set to `true`, the command returns the signed transaction. If `returntx` is set to `false` (default), the command sends the transaction and returns the transaction ID.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I sign a message using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can sign a message using Verus by running the following command:\n```\nverus signmessage \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" \"my message\"\n```\nReplace `\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\"` with the address you want to sign with, and `\"my message\"` with the message you want to sign.", "qa_tuples": [["How do I verify a signature using Verus?", "You can verify a signature using Verus by running the following command:\n```\nverus verifymessage \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" \"signature\" \"my message\"\n```\nReplace `\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\"` with the address that signed the message, `\"signature\"` with the signature to verify, and `\"my message\"` with the original message."], ["What is the `updateidentity` command used for in Verus?", "The `updateidentity` command is used to update an identity in Verus.

What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning about Verus ID. What is it, and what are its key features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus ID is a decentralized identity technology that provides a secure, quantum-ready, fully decentralized, and self-sovereign digital identity system. It includes built-in privacy through the integration of zk-SNARKs and offers several benefits, such as:\n\n* Recovery of lost funds after losing keys\n* Security against identity and key theft\n* Ability to prove certain information without revealing more than necessary\n* Transfer of assets to heirs as part of an estate\n\nVerus ID is designed to give users complete control over their digital identity and assets. Does that help? Do you have any more questions about Verus ID?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What about Verus Smart Transactions? How does it differ from crypto-conditions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Smart Transactions is a new smart transaction technology unique to the Verus network. It uses standard Bitcoin style serialization, which makes it simpler to implement support on lite or mobile wallets compared to crypto-conditions, which use ASN.1. Verus Smart Transactions will be available for use on other blockchains with the upcoming PBaaS network upgrade.\n\nIn short, Verus Smart Transactions offers a more streamlined and compatible solution for smart transactions on the Verus network. Do you have any further questions about Verus Smart Transactions?\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about VerusHash 2.1. What's the difference between it and VerusHash 2.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 is an improvement to the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm, which was designed to equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which is expected to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still allowing FPGAs to operate with minor modifications.\n\nVerusHash 2.1 aims to provide a more balanced and efficient mining experience on the Verus network. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI've seen the phrase \"not your keys, not your coins\" thrown around in the context of blockchain identity technology. What does it mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe phrase \"not your keys, not your coins\" highlights the importance of controlling one's private keys in blockchain identity technology. If you lose your keys, you risk losing access to your digital assets, and no one can recover your money for you. This phrase emphasizes the need for a secure and reliable identity system, such as Verus ID, which provides a way to recover lost funds and protect against identity and key theft.\n\nIn short, having control over your private keys is crucial to maintaining control over your digital assets.

This release also introduces a new smart transaction technology that is unique to the Verus network and replaces its use of Komodo compatible crypto-conditions. The Verus ID system was made possible through the use of Verus Smart Transactions, which will be available for everyone to use on their own blockchains in the upcoming PBaaS network upgrade. Verus Smart Transactions use standard Bitcoin style serialization rather than the ASN.1 used in crypto conditions, which makes support on lite or mobile wallets simpler to implement than the crypto-condition protocol, which is still used on the Verus network for Stake Guard. ## VerusHash 2.1 VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# Verus ID - A Better Blockchain Identity Technology If you\u2019ve been around crypto for even a little while, you\u2019ll start to hear things like \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d, \u201close your keys, lose your coins\u201d.

This same security feature is supported between all PBaaS chains and has been implemented in the Ethereum contracts for witnesses as well. This new protocol also provides for other types of evidence to prevent finalization, such as proof that there exists a more powerful (most power rule) tip than one witnessed. Enabling decentralized, cross-chain most power rules are an advance in cross-chain protocols that over time will strongly protect censorship resistance qualities of any multichain protocol.  - The above technology required changes to generalize evidence types between chains, enabling cryptographic enforcement that all notarizations are ultimately determined by miners and stakers and finalized by witnesses who must follow most power (stake+work) rules based on the protocol. Witnesses cannot finalize a chain tip unless alternating miners and stakers have posted 3 consecutive, agreeing, progressing cross-chain notarizations, without intervening disagreement, trading off more certain cross-chain transaction latency for on that depends on miners and stakers, meaning maximum decentralization and a high cost to DoS attack cross-chain, approaching impossible over any significant length of time. This approach makes the incentivized merge mining and bridge mining opportunities, as well as miner/staker participation, automatically part of and also critical to the cross-chain protocol. In v0.9.4, all users on the network may mine the Ethereum bridge via the bridgekeeper tool on the mining page in the GUI.  - With this new protocol, all PBaaS chains on testnet will consider witnessed / finalized tips final and will not unwind past those witness points or follow a chain that disagrees with a known finalized tip.

We have seen a very small number of people hit this issue after transferring IDs between owners and/or separate wallets and having spent prior outputs on transactions that still have valid UTXOs to the ID. If you have encountered such an issue, this version will properly synchronize the wallet with a full rescan. If you have not, use of this version will prevent the issue from ever occurring. - Stricter updateidentity paramater checks to ensure that revocation and recovery IDs are already registered, valid IDs on the blockchain before accepting a change## Testnet Reset The testnet was deleted and relaunched on v0.7.2-2. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO v0.7.2-2, PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RELEASE NOTES BEFORE RUNNING THIS UPDATE**", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out where my Verus wallet files are stored. Do you know where they are usually located on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe standard locations for Verus wallet files on different operating systems are:\n* Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC`\n* Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`\nAlternatively, you can find the Verus data folder through Verus Desktop by clicking `help` and then `Show Verus data folder (default)`. Do you have any other questions about Verus wallet files or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What's the preferred method for backing up my wallet in Verus, and how do I do it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe preferred method for backing up your wallet in Verus is by exporting your wallet. You can do this through Verus Desktop by going to `Settings`, `Coin Settings`, and clicking `Export native wallet backup`. Alternatively, you can use the command line interface (CLI) by running `./verus z_exportwallet \"<mywalletexport>\"` on Linux/MacOS or `verus z_exportwallet \"<mywalletexport>\"` on Windows. Replace `<mywalletexport>` with a filename that only contains letters and figures, without any file extension. The exported wallet file will be saved in the same directory as your `wallet.dat`. Do you have any questions about this process or would you like to know about an alternate method?\n\n**User:**\nYes, what's the alternate method for backing up my wallet in Verus, and how do I do it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe alternate method for backing up your wallet in Verus is by running the `backupwallet` command. You can do this through Verus Desktop by going to `Settings`, `Coin Settings`, and typing `run backupwallet \"<DestinationFileName>\"` in the text box. Alternatively, you can use the command line interface (CLI) by running `./verus backupwallet \"<DestinationFileName>\"` on Linux/MacOS or `verus backupwallet \"<DestinationFileName>\"` on Windows. Replace `<DestinationFileName>` with a filename that only contains letters and figures, without any file extension. The backup wallet file will be saved in the same directory as your `wallet.dat`. Do you have any questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing. I have non-Verus chains like Komodo and its asset chains, as well as Zcash.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `setminingdistribution` command, but I'm not sure how to set multiple mining outputs. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `setminingdistribution` command by providing a JSON object with destination addresses and their corresponding relative values. For example:\n```\nverus setminingdistribution {\"myaddress\":0.5, \"otheraddress\":0.5}\n```\nThis command sets the mining distribution to split rewards 50/50 between \"myaddress\" and \"otheraddress\". Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about using `setminingdistribution`?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. What happens when I submit a block using the `submitblock` command? What are the possible results?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe possible results of submitting a block using the `submitblock` command are:\n* \"duplicate\" - node already has a valid copy of the block\n* \"duplicate-invalid\" - node already has the block, but it is invalid\n* \"duplicate-inconclusive\" - node already has the block, but has not validated it\n* \"inconclusive\" - node has not validated the block, it may not be on the node's current best chain\n* \"rejected\" - block was rejected as invalid\n\nThese results indicate whether the block was accepted, rejected, or if there's an issue with validation. Do you have any more questions about submitting blocks?\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing. What's the purpose of the `setminingdistribution` command in Verus, anyway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `setminingdistribution` command sets multiple mining outputs with amounts that will be used to calculate relative outputs to each address for any reward.

Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been trying to use the `z_shieldcoinbase` command, but I'm not really sure what arguments it requires. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required arguments for the `z_shieldcoinbase` command are:\n\n1. \"fromaddress\" (string, required) - The address is a taddr or \"*\" for all taddrs belonging to the wallet.\n2. \"toaddress\" (string, required) - The address is a zaddr.\n\nDo you have any further questions about this command or its arguments?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I think that helps a lot. But what does the command actually do, and what information does it provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `z_shieldcoinbase` command is a JSON object that provides the following information:\n\n* `remainingUTXOs`: The number of coinbase utxos still available for shielding.\n* `remainingValue`: The value of coinbase utxos still available for shielding.\n* `shieldingUTXOs`: The number of coinbase utxos being shielded.\n* `shieldingValue`: The value of coinbase utxos being shielded.\n* `opid`: An operation ID to pass to `z_getoperationstatus` to get the result of the operation.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that's really helpful. So, what's the purpose of this command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_shieldcoinbase` command is used to shield transparent coinbase funds by sending them to a shielded z-addr.

What would you like to know today?\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the key characteristics of a fully decentralized VerusID protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA fully decentralized VerusID protocol has the following characteristics: anyone can create a VerusID without permission, the creator has complete, self-sovereign control over their VerusID, and all costs to create a VerusID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Additionally, VerusIDs are revocable, recoverable, and private. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. What makes VerusIDs private?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are private because each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when available. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI heard about VerusHash 2.0 and VerusHash 2.1. What are they, and how do they differ?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.0 was designed to equalize the performance of FPGAs and modern CPUs, preventing FPGAs from dominating the network. VerusHash 2.1 is an adjustment to this equalization technology, aiming to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. This allows for a more balanced and inclusive mining and staking environment.\n\n**User:**\nYou mentioned that VerusIDs are fully decentralized. What does that mean exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, a fully decentralized protocol means that anyone can create an ID and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without needing permission. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of privacy features do VerusIDs have?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints.

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network. # Disclaimer", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm trying to figure out how to use the `getvdxfid` command. What arguments does it take?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getvdxfid` command takes a single required argument, `vdxfuri`, which is a string message to be converted from hex and hashed. Additionally, it can take three optional arguments: `vdxfkey`, `uint256`, and `indexnum`, which are used to combine with the hash. Do you have any other questions about the `getvdxfid` command?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what's the structure of the result returned by the `getvdxfid` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `getvdxfid` command is a JSON object containing four properties: `vdxfid`, `hash160result`, `qualifiedname`, and `bounddata`. The `vdxfid` property is a base58check-encoded VDXF ID, the `hash160result` property is a 20-byte hash in hex, the `qualifiedname` property is an object containing the name and parent ID, and the `bounddata` property is an object containing additional data bound to create the value.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI have a few questions about Verus. What is the requirement to enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities, you need to have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. How does the Verus ID and NFT marketplace work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT marketplace is a decentralized platform that allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. Users can advertise their offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, without the need for intermediaries. Users can pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, and accept payment to either as well.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is required for a currency's ID issuance if it requires permission from the currency's identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a currency's ID issuance requires permission from the currency's identity, then the identity must sign the name commitment and identity registration. This can be done by either using the parent identity to fund those transactions or by receiving a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I register an identity using the `verus` command line tool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo register an identity, you can use the `registeridentity` command with the following format:\n\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{\"txid\": \"67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f\",\"namereservation\": {... }, \"identity\": {... }}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny\n```\n\nYou need to replace the `txid`, `namereservation`, and `identity` fields with your own data.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `returntx` option when registering an identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `returntx` option allows you to receive a raw transaction that needs to be signed by the identity owner, rather than using the parent identity to fund the transactions. This is useful when a currency's ID issuance requires permission from the currency's identity.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are some of the additional capabilities of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the additional capabilities of Verus include:\n\n* On-chain launches of token, centralized currency, and liquidity basket AMMs\n* On-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming\n* On-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where you can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain.

Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, and you can pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is Verus Vault, and what are its benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows you to protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key. If you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. You can also still receive funds.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I register an identity on the Verus network using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo register an identity on the Verus network, you can use the `registeridentity` command with the following format:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{\"txid\": \"67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f\",\"namereservation\": {... }, \"identity\": {... }}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny\n```\nThis command requires a JSON object with information about the identity, including the transaction ID, name reservation, and identity details.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are some additional capabilities of the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome additional capabilities of the Verus network include:\n\n* On-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs\n* On-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming\n* On-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles", "qa_tuples": [["What is the requirement to enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities?", "To enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities, you need to have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured."], ["How does the Verus ID and NFT marketplace work?", "The Verus ID and NFT marketplace is a decentralized platform that allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain.

What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to learn more about the Verus network. What is the Verus network's architecture, and how does it enable multiple blockchains to operate and interoperate simultaneously?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network's architecture is fractal, allowing for an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. Each blockchain on the Verus network can operate independently, with all features and currencies of the public chain, but without the access restrictions. While there is some overhead for cross-notarization, this architecture enables seamless interaction between multiple blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. How can I lock an ID on the Verus network, and what are the implications of locking an ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock an ID on the Verus network using the `updateidentity` API with the `timelock` parameter. This sets the unlock height of the identity, effectively locking it until the specified block height. A locked identity cannot revoke itself, and revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of the time delay or unlock height.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about currency converters?

What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDon't worry about that warning! If your antivirus software flags the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", it's likely a false positive warning. This is because the software includes mining capabilities, which may be flagged by antivirus software as potentially exploitable by third parties.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the `.txt` file that comes with each download from the Verus Coin Foundation Releases. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `.txt` file contains the signer, standard SHA256 file checksum, and signature, which are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the downloaded file. This is an important security measure to ensure that the file hasn't been tampered with during the download process.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I verify the signature of a downloaded file using the `verus` command line tool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the signature of a downloaded file using the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command. For example:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <file_path>\n```\nOr:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <checksum>\n```\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`. This gives you an extra layer of confidence that the file is genuine and hasn't been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the v0.7.4 update of Verus. What are the key features and improvements in this update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.7.4 update of Verus includes several key features and improvements, such as improved node synchronization, upgrades and resets the Verus testnet in preparation for the testnet launch of the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge, fixes all known functionality issues reported from the previous testnet, adds the ability to export an ID from one chain to another using the `exportid` parameter in `sendcurrency`, and enables cross-chain use of VerusIDs.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a significant update. How can I export an ID from one chain to another using the `verus` command line tool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can export an ID from one chain to another using the `sendcurrency` command with the `exportid` parameter set to `true`. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nThis will export the ID `IDNAME@` from the `VRSCTEST` chain to the `PBaaSChainName` chain.

It also includes the ability to export an ID from one chain to another, using the \u201cexportid\u201d:true parameter in sendcurrency, enabling cross-chain use of VerusIDs. With this release, we will be resetting the Verus testnet. To use the new testnet, you must make sure to delete the vrsctest and .verustest/pbaas or VerusTest\\pbaas folders beforehand.In addition to being prepared for the Ethereum bridge launch, this release adds some new testnet capabilities, including the ability to send to IDs cross chain and export IDs from chain to chain using the `\u201cexportid\u201d:true` parameter with `sendcurrency`. IDs only need to be exported once and can then be used and managed directly as a forked ID on the destination chain.## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain  ```  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'  ```", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the file directly or using a checksum.

This release both fixes the remaining known bridge issues and adds security to ensure that you don't send to an unspendable address on any network by using the wrong format for a destination.The good news is that throughout the whole process of this first bridge release on testnet, we've been able to update through the issues we've seen without a reset and have not lost a single satoshi of test funds (which is not to say it is fully hardened quite yet). At this point, we hope and believe that this is the last update in this round of testnet, which will allow us to get back to focusing on the mainnet release and not asking those testing to update until we are very close to a mainnet release.Once more, we will ask that you shut down the old version now, and we will restart the notarizations and transaction flow between Ethereum and Verus at 5 AM UTC time.Thank you to everyone who helped with all the testing and exposing of issues that enabled us to make maybe even inconveniently quick progress.If you miss the fork for this version at the above time you can get back on the correct chain by stopping Verus and deleting deleting everything other than your wallet.dat file in your data directory at: - Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest` - Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` - Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest`", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been playing around with some commands and I'm not entirely sure what one of them does. What is the result of the `signrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `signrawtransaction` command is a JSON object containing three properties: \"hex\" - the hex-encoded raw transaction with signature(s), \"complete\" - a boolean indicating if the transaction has a complete set of signatures, and \"errors\" - a JSON array of objects containing script verification errors (if any). Do you have any more questions about this command or its output?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! But I'm still not entirely sure why I'd use this command. What is the purpose of the `signrawtransaction` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `signrawtransaction` command is used to sign a transaction with a set of provided private keys.

What's included in that file?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `.txt` file includes the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. This file is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the downloaded archive.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How do I actually verify the signature of a downloaded Verus archive?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the signature of a downloaded Verus archive, you need to:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted `.txt` file.\n3.

This version also fixes an issue discovered when defining Ethereum NFT mapped tokens, which are not yet supported in the released Ethereum contracts, but are updated no in the daemon and ready to use when the contracts are upgraded, hopefully in the next few days.NFT mapped tokens will allow you to define an Ethereum NFT as the token that controls revoke and recover for an ID. Similar to how you can define a token for tokenized ID control, an NFT mapped token, when defined, refers by contract and tokenid to a specific NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Once defined as the currency for a specific ID or sub-ID and linked to the Ethereum NFT, that NFT will be able to be sent over from the Ethereum blockchain as a satoshi of that currency, sent to any address or ID on the Verus blockchain, exchanged trustlessly on the Verus on-chain P2P marketplace, and used to revoke and recover the ID which defined the token. Once the contracts are updated, you will be able to mint NFTs on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet, and endow your Ethereum NFTs with all of the power of your specially named VerusID. This new technology allows you to protect your NFTs with VerusID\u2019s revoke and recover technology, bind your NFT to the pseudonymous ID you use to log into applications, use it to extend and publish much more than just the NFT, and generally take your Ethereum NFTs to the next level!", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm a bit new to Verus, so I have some questions about shielding. What is shielding in the context of Verus Coin, and why is it necessary?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nShielding is the process of moving coins from a transparent R-address to a shielded z-address. This is necessary to use coins in staking when they first unlock, as part of the Zcash protocol. Shielding allows you to use your coins in staking and other transactions. Would you like to know more about shielding or how to shield your coins?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. How do I shield coins in Verus Coin using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo shield coins, you need to use the `z_shieldcoinbase` command. You can either use an existing z-address or create a new one using `verus z_getnewaddress`. To shield all coinbase in your wallet, use the following command: `verus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\" <YOUR zs-ADDRESS>`. To shield a single address, use `verus z_shieldcoinbase <YOUR R-ADDRESS> <YOUR zs-ADDRESS>`. Do you have any questions about this process or would you like to know more about the difference between R-addresses and z-addresses?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps. I think I'd like to know more about the difference between a transparent R-address and a shielded z-address in Verus Coin.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA transparent R-address is a regular address that is publicly visible, while a shielded z-address is a private address that keeps your transactions and balance private. Shielded addresses are necessary for staking and other transactions that require privacy. Would you like to know more about how to use shielded addresses, like how to send coins from a shielded z-address to a transparent address?\n\n**User:**\nExactly! How do I send Verus Coins from a shielded z-address to a transparent address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo send coins from a shielded z-address to a transparent address, you can use the `z_sendmany` command.

Attention: Read it completely before use. Note: Shielding is no longer required for coinbase rewards after block 800200. Earlier timelocked coins will still need to be shielded in order to use them. ### Important General Information `verus command \"<userinput>\"` needs to be entered literally, with `<userinput>` replaced by your specific userdata. So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address, so it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`. #### General remarks on CLI wallet: On Windows command line enter the commands as shown without the surrounding quotation marks In Linux shell preceed the commands without surrounding quotation marks with `./` In MacOS shell preceed the commands without surrounding quotation marks with `./` Example: the windows version `verus listtransactions` transforms in Linux or MacOS to `./verus listtransactions`. #### General remarks on Windows command line formatting: The CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS. For windows substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character. For windows substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters. ## Procedure: You must first \"shield coins\" (send from a transparent R-addr to a shielded zaddr) to be able to use them in staking, when they first unlock. This is part of the Zcash protocol itself. The commands below assume you are in the Verus source code directory `verus z_shieldcoinbase` You can either use an existing zaddr or use a new zaddr. To make a new zaddr: `verus z_getnewaddress` Use the address the above command outputs in the `z_shieldcoinbase` command To shield all coinbase in your wallet, you can use `\"*\"` (quotes are important) and zaddr that is getting the funds: `verus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\" <YOUR zs-ADDRESS>` To just shield a single address, specify that as the first argument: `verus z_shieldcoinbase <YOUR R-ADDRESS> <YOUR zs-ADDRESS>` Once the funds have moved to the zaddr and are confirmed, you can freely send them to any address, They will be eligble for staking id sent to a transpartent address (R-address). To send from a certain zaddr to a transparent address, use z_sendmany. The following command sends 10 Verus to a given transparent address, ID address or ID-name.

Do you have any questions about Verus or its features?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was wondering about bridge converter currencies. What are they?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBridge converter currencies are a type of fractional basket currency that is bound to the launch of a new blockchain. They have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but run on the new blockchain and generate fees that are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about bridge converter currencies?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps! But I'm still a bit confused about fractional basket currencies in general. Can you explain the concept of fractional basket currencies in Verus DeFi, and how they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus DeFi, fractional basket currencies are a type of currency that is backed by one or more asset currencies at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing issues like miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running.

Do you have any more questions about Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies?\n\n**User:**\nHow does the Verus DeFi protocol address miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol addresses MEV and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions using a particular liquidity pool and mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This prevents miners from extracting value by reordering transactions or front-running, providing a fair and secure DeFi experience. Do you have any more questions about MEV and front-running?\n\n**User:**\nHow do blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches work on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches allow users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less network fees.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about tokenized ID control. What is it, and how does it relate to NFTs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTokenized ID control is a feature that allows an ID to be treated like a super NFT over all copies of the source ID on all chains that were exported to other chains after the currency was created. This enables NFTs to be upleveled with ID powers, being cryptographically bound as an ID's permanent control token that can be sent to any chain or to Ethereum and back. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about tokenized ID control or NFTs?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What is the current status of NFT mapped tokens on Ethereum contracts?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNFT mapped tokens are not yet implemented in the Ethereum contracts, but they are supported on the RC2 PBaaS protocol. This means that you will not be able to send NFTs from Ethereum to Verus or PBaaS chains until the implementation is complete. We're working on it, and I'll let you know when it's done!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I'm also curious about the new methods to burn currency in liquidity currencies. Can you tell me more about those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are two new methods to burn currency in liquidity currencies:\n\n1. `burnweight`: available to centralized currencies only, it enables burning the primary currency to raise the reserve ratio weights of all reserves.\n2. `burn` for reserve currencies: it donates the burned amount of reserve into the currency's reserves without taking any new supply in exchange.\n\nThese new methods provide more flexibility and control over currency burning in liquidity currencies. Do you have any questions about how they work or when to use them?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I think I understand. What is Bridgekeeper, and how can it be used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBridgekeeper is a feature that allows for permissionless bridge notarization. It is selectable in the GUI on the mining page, and a Node application will be made available for testing in the next few days. Bridgekeeper enables more decentralized and flexible bridge notarization, and we're excited to see how the community will use it.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I'd like to know more about the enhancements to the RC1 cross-chain witness and notarization protocol in RC2.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn RC2, any notarization to be confirmed must be first posted publicly to allow for potential to prove invalidity, and then later confirmed. This is an enhancement over the prior protocol, where a witnessed notarization could be posted to a chain and accepted when first seen, which had an attack vector of even stolen notary/witness keys combined. The new protocol provides an additional layer of security and protection against potential attacks.

This unique Verus-only technology and VerusIDs enable new models of complex, atomic and fully decentralized transactions. By using exported IDs across any number of networks and an ID control token, ownership of an unlimited array of assets across an unlimited number of networks can for the first time ever, have ownership transferred in one transaction. - While NFT mapped tokens are supported on the RC2 PBaaS protocol, they have not yet been implemented in the Ethereum contracts.

In v0.9.4, you can now also \u201cburn\u201d reserve currencies in a liquidity basket currency, which simply donates that amount of reserve into the currency\u2019s reserves without taking any new supply in exchange.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `addmergedblock` command. What are the possible results of this command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `addmergedblock` command can return two possible results:\n\n1. `\"deserialize-invalid\"`: The block could not be deserialized and was rejected as invalid.\n2. `\"blocksfull\"`: The block did not exceed others in estimated ROI, and there was no room for an additional merge mined block.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the `addmergedblock` command?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's all. But I do have a question about creating a new blockchain currency using the `definecurrency` command. How do I define a new blockchain currency using this command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a new blockchain currency using the `definecurrency` command, you need to provide two JSON objects as arguments. The first object defines the currency properties, and the second object defines the gateway properties. The basic format of the command is:\n```\ndefinecurrency '{\"name\": \"coinortokenname\",..., \"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"identity\"},..]}' '({\"name\": \"fractionalgatewayname\",..., })'\n```\nYou need to replace the placeholders with the actual values for your currency and gateway.

What are the requirements for creating a new currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a new currency in Verus, the identity it is named after must be minted on the blockchain on which the currency is created.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm having some trouble with entering Verus commands on the Windows command prompt. The commands are shown in Linux/MacOS format, and I'm not sure how to adapt them. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using the Windows command prompt, you need to make a few substitutions. You'll need to substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character, and substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters. Additionally, omit the preceding `./`. For example, the Linux command `./verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> '[{\"address\":\"<my_transparent_address>\",\"amount\":<95.9998>}]'` would become `verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> \"[{\\\"address\\\":\\\"<my_transparent_address>\\\",\\\"amount\\\":<95.9998>}]\"` on the Windows command prompt.

So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address, so it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`. #### Remarks on Windows command line formatting: The CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS. On the native windows command prompt (`cmd.com`) the formatting is different. * In windows command prompt, substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character. * In windows command prompt, substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters. * In windows command prompt, omit the preceding `./`. Note: As an example, in Linux the command: `./verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> '[{\"address\":\"<my_transparent_address>\",\"amount\":<95.9998>}]'` should be entered on the Windows command prompt as: `verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> \"[{\\\"address\\\":\\\"<my_transparent_address>\\\",\\\"amount\\\":<95.9998>}]\"` ## Procedure: 1) `./verus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\"` my_private_address_without_quotationmarks this capture all so called coinbases, i.e. mined coins that are not yet staking. you have to wait 100 blocks (minutes) after receiving them before being able to move them. wait for a few minutes for the tx to be confirmed. 2) `./verus z_getbalance <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks>` this is to substract the 0.0001 VRSC fee from the balance in the next step. 3) `./verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> '[{\"address\":\"<my_transparent_address>\",\"amount\":<95.9998>}]'` amount is minus 0.0001 from balance and without quotation marks.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in the VerusID protocol. Can you explain how it enables users to create their own tokens and blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusID protocol enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack-resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds powerful. What's the benefit of using VerusIDs as cryptocurrency addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. This makes it easier to use and manage multiple currencies and blockchain identities.\n\n**User:**\nHow can users create their own token currencies or blockchains using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsers with a VerusID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain. This blockchain can be 50% POW/50% POS, making it 51% hash attack resistant. The blockchain can also be merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's unique about the launch of a new blockchain in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, a new blockchain can be launched simultaneously with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This bridge converter currency has the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially backed currencies. This enables a world-class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain to be launched along with a decentralized or centralized liquidity pool.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the significance of the VerusID protocol, and can it be implemented on non-Verus systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusID protocol is a protocol that enables identities to be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. Additionally, the VerusID protocol can also be implemented on non-Verus systems, making it a versatile and widely applicable solution.\n\n**User:**\nWhat capabilities does the Verus platform provide to users who want to create their own tokens or blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus platform enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. These blockchains can be merge-mineable, interoperable, and 51% hash attack resistant.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies. Can you explain what they are and how they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi fractional basket currencies are currencies defined by ID owners, backed by one or more asset currencies at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner-extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is Verus Vault and how does it help with theft prevention?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a staking-capable time locking and theft prevention mechanism that enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user's keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft-proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are DeFi liquidity pools and how do they work in the context of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDeFi liquidity pools are a feature of the Verus protocol that allows any ID owner to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers.\n\n**User:**\nHow does Verus enable users to create their own decentralized tokens and blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack-resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in digital signatures using Verus. How can I create a digital signature using Verus, and what is the command format?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a digital signature using Verus, you can use the `signfile` or `signmessage` commands. The format for these commands is as follows:\n\n```\nverus signfile \"address\" \"filepath/filename\"\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nverus signmessage \"address\" \"message\"\n```\n\nReplace `\"address\"` with the address or identity that you want to use to sign the file or message, and replace `\"filepath/filename\"` or `\"message\"` with the file or message you want to sign. Do you have any questions about this process or would you like to know more about verifying digital signatures?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! Now I'd like to know how to verify a digital signature using Verus, and what is the command format?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify a digital signature using Verus, you can use the `verifyhash` or `verifymessage` commands. The format for these commands is as follows:\n\n```\nverus verifyhash \"address\" \"signature\" \"hexhash\"\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nverus verifymessage \"address\" \"signature\" \"message\" [\"checklatest\"]\n```\n\nReplace `\"address\"` with the address or identity that was used to sign the file or message, `\"signature\"` with the signature that you want to verify, and `\"hexhash\"` or `\"message\"` with the hash of the file or the original message that was signed. The `\"checklatest\"` parameter is optional and defaults to `false`. Do you have any questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the `checklatest` parameter in the `verifymessage` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `checklatest` parameter in the `verifymessage` command is a boolean value that determines how the signature is verified. If set to `true`, the signature is verified based on the latest identity. If set to `false` (which is the default), the signature is verified based on the signing height stored in the signature. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nCan I use JSON RPC to verify a digital signature using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use JSON RPC to verify a digital signature using Verus.

What are the main improvements in Verus version X that will help with global network synchronization, mining, and staking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main improvements in this version of Verus include:\n\n1. Reconfigured connection ratios and better seed node discovery, with default outgoing connections set to 4 and default incoming connections for full nodes set to 384.\n2. Improved lag detection, which stops mining or staking when a lag is detected and devotes resources to catching up.\n3.

How can I increase the number of connections in my Verus node to help the network and broadcast my stakes more quickly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can increase the number of connections in your Verus node by adding the line \"maxconnections=n\" to your VRSC.conf file, where n is the number of connections you want to use. This will allow your node to broadcast your stakes more quickly and help the network. Do you have any experience with editing configuration files, or would you like some guidance on that?\n\n**User:**\nI think I can handle that. What happens when my wallet detects a lag in the blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen your wallet detects a lag in the blockchain, it immediately stops attempting to mine or stake and devotes maximum resources to catching up. This ensures that mining and staking occur on a viable tip of the chain, rather than contributing to further lag.\n\n**User:**\nGood to know. What updates are included in the latest version of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis version of Verus includes all updates and improvements from Komodo Platform as of 1.5 weeks ago, which have been merged into the Verus codebase.

Reconfigured connection ratios, better seed node discovery built in. Default outgoing connections now 4, default incoming for full node 384. If your machine can handle it, you can help the network and broadcast your stakes more quickly to increase the number of connections in your VRSC.conf with \"maxconnections=n\", where n is the number you wish to use. 2. Improved lag detection. If your wallet detects a lag, it immediately stops attempting to mine or stake and devotes maximum resources to catching up. Rather than continuing to mine or stake, which may contribute to further lag, this action ensures mining and staking occurs on a viable tip of the chain. 3. Improved staking efficiency. This version raises the default priority of the staking thread, ensuring that the staking process is fast and efficient, even in cases where it would have also lagged with mining or other machine load. 4.

Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.#### Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. VerusIDs provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, VerusID provides:### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `z_mergetoaddress` command, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. Can you tell me more about its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_mergetoaddress` command is used to merge multiple UTXOs and notes into a single UTXO or note. It ignores protected coinbase UTXOs, which can be combined into a single note using `z_shieldcoinbase`. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really useful. But when I tried to use it, I got an error saying it was disabled. How do I enable the `z_mergetoaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable the `z_mergetoaddress` command, you need to restart verusd with the `-experimentalfeatures` and `-zmergetoaddress` command-line options, or add the following lines to the `VRSC.conf` file: `experimentalfeatures=1` and `zmergetoaddress=1`. Have you tried that?\n\n**User:**\nI'll give it a shot. But what happens to the UTXOs selected for merging when using `z_mergetoaddress`? Do they get destroyed or something?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe UTXOs selected for merging will be locked. If there is an error, they will be unlocked. You can use the RPC call `listlockunspent` to return a list of locked UTXOs. So don't worry, they're not destroyed, just locked temporarily.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Is there a way to limit the number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging using `z_mergetoaddress`? I don't want to merge too many at once.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can limit the number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging by setting the transparent limit and shielded limit parameters. If the transparent limit parameter is set to zero, and Overwinter is not yet active, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option will determine the number of UTXOs. After Overwinter has activated, `-mempooltxinputlimit` is ignored, and having a transparent input limit of zero will limit the number of UTXOs based on the size of the transaction.

What's significant about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.9.4-1 release of Verus is significant because it introduces the world's first self-sovereign, tokenized ID control technology. This release has no material mainnet changes, but for testnet, it is RC3 of the PBaaS protocol and is required to follow the main testnet chain.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds groundbreaking! What are some of the key features and additions in the v0.9.4-1 release of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the key features and additions in the v0.9.4-1 release of Verus include:\n\n1. The ability for any ID, even sub-IDs, to generate a single token as its currency.\n2.

RC3 has some significant and important API additions, including the ability for any ID at all, even sub-IDs, to generate a single token as its currency. That token then enables whoever holds it to have another level of revoke/recover power over the ID, in addition to the normal revocation and recovery authorities, which also still work. This technology is now available in the pre-existing APIs, updateidentity (for changing revocation / recovery authorities), revokeidentity, and recoveryidentity. Please see help for details.In addition, we have continued to harden the protocol and fixed issues with cross-chain currency definition import/export and the new ability to burn reserves into a liquidity basket that were reported in the current testnet.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some of the options when running Verus. What's the purpose of the `-maxconnections` option, and what's the default value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-maxconnections` option specifies the maximum number of connections to peers that Verus will maintain. The default value is 384. This option allows you to control how many connections Verus establishes with other nodes in the network, which can affect performance and resource usage.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the `-onion` option? How does it differ from the `-proxy` option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-onion` option allows Verus to use a separate SOCKS5 proxy to reach peers via Tor hidden services. This is different from the `-proxy` option, which connects through a SOCKS5 proxy, but does not necessarily use Tor hidden services. The `-onion` option is specifically designed to work with Tor's hidden services, providing an additional layer of privacy and anonymity when connecting to the Verus network.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering where the configuration files for Verus and Komodo are stored on different operating systems.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe configuration files for Verus and Komodo are stored in different locations depending on the operating system. On Linux, they are stored in `~/.komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`. On Mac OS, they are stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`. On Windows 10, they are stored in `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`, `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, or `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`. Do you have any other questions about Verus or Komodo configuration?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How do I tokenize ID control (next-generation NFT) using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo tokenize ID control, you need to define a currency with specific flags and settings. Here's an example command:\n\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```\n\nIn this command, the `options` flag is set to 2080, which includes the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN` flags. The `preallocations` setting specifies the initial token allocation, and `maxpreconversion` is set to 0, indicating that the token is pre-allocated. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that's really helpful. Another question I had was how to create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent using Verus.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent, you need to use the `registernamecommitment` and `registeridentity` commands. Here's an example:\n\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr \"\" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny\n```\n\nThis command registers a name commitment with a parent currency of `vrsc-btc`. Then, you need to register the identity using the `registeridentity` command:\n\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{\"txid\": \"67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f\",\"namereservation\": { \"version\": 1, \"name\": \"ID\", \"parent\": \"i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt\", \"salt\": \"b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01\", \"referral\": \"\"},\"identity\":{\"primaryaddresses\":[\"RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr\"],\"minimumsignatures\":1,\"name\":\"ID\",\"parent\":\"vrsc-btc@\"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny\n```\n\nThis command registers the identity with the specified parent currency and settings.

Attention: Read it completely before use. ### Useful links for VRSC mining: [Miners download page](https://verus.io/get-vrsc) [Miner configuration guide](#!faq-macos\\mac-faq03-mining_guide.md) ## Procedure: In order to let your mining not interfere with other processes running on your PC, we'll need to deprioritize the mining process. This will result in your miner throttling down whenever your PC needs processing power. People have reported to be able to use CPU-heavy applications, like games, without the miner interfering, with this method. Because the Verus wallet (GUI and CLI) does a lot more than mining, it is not recommended to use this for a solo-mining setup. First thing you will need is pool-mining software. The link is supplied above this procedure. Download your preferred miner, extract it to your prefered location and configure the batchfile with the pool of your choice and your own mining address. Now we'll need to adjust the batchfile to run on low priority: #### NHEQMINER: - Run your miner as you normally would, with `nice -n 19 ` placed in front of the command you normally use,   for example:    `nice -n 19 ./nheqminer -v -l pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -p x -t 6`  - make sure you replace the pool (`pool.verus.io:9999`) with your prefered pool and the address   (`RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ`) with your own address. The address shown in this line is the veruscoin   foundation donation address. If desired change the identifier (`Donator`) to a name that easily identifies the   miner to you. Created by Oink.vrsc@.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some of the command-line options for Verus. Can you tell me what the purpose of the `-zapwallettxes=<mode>` option is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-zapwallettxes=<mode>` option is used to delete all wallet transactions and recover only those parts of the blockchain through `-rescan` on startup. The `<mode>` parameter determines what transaction metadata to keep or drop. Mode 1 keeps transaction metadata such as account owner and payment request information, while mode 2 drops this metadata.

What does it mean for a VerusID to be private, and what features does it have to support this privacy?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID being private means that it contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used for various endpoints such as messaging, financial transactions, or voting. Additionally, each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used with applications and identity policies to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also heard about VerusHash, which is a hash algorithm used by the Verus network. What improvements does VerusHash 2.1 introduce compared to VerusHash 2.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which is expected to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications.\n\n**User:**\nBefore I start using Verus, I want to know what kind of risks are associated with using the Verus software and what kind of warranty does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and it comes with a disclaimer stating that it is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network. # DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.

Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm a bit lost. What's the purpose of this guide, and which Linux distributions is it intended for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis guide is intended to help users compile Monkins' Verus enhanced CCMiner for various hardware, and it is specifically aimed at Debian-based Linux distributions. If you are using a different type of distribution, such as RPM-based (like CentOS), you will need to install the dependencies using a procedure that fits your specific distribution.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. What are the three active branches in the CCMiner GitHub repository, and what type of hardware is each intended for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe three active branches in the CCMiner GitHub repository are:\n\n1. `ARM`: intended for 64-bit ARM chips with AES intrinsic.\n2. `Verus2.2`: intended for standard x86-64 PCs.\n3. `Verus2.2gpu`: intended for GPUs.\n\nDo you have a specific hardware setup you're working with?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I think I'll be using a Debian-based system with a GPU. What dependencies need to be installed before compiling CCMiner, and how can they be installed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe dependencies that need to be installed before compiling CCMiner are:\n\n* `libcurl4-openssl-dev`\n* `libssl-dev`\n* `libjansson-dev`\n* `automake`\n* `autotools-dev`\n* `build-essential`\n* `git`\n\nThese dependencies can be installed on a Debian-based system using the following command:\n```\nsudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libjansson-dev automake autotools-dev build-essential git\n```\nJust run that command, and you'll be all set!\n\n**User:**\nGot it! Since I'm using a GPU, what additional sources are required for compiling the GPU miner, and how can they be obtained?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFor compiling the GPU miner, additional sources are required, specifically the CUDA toolkit from NVIDIA. This can be obtained by downloading and running the CUDA installer:\n```\nwget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.2/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.2.89_440.33.01_linux.run\nsudo sh cuda_10.2.89_440.33.01_linux.run\n```\nJust follow those two commands, and you'll have the CUDA toolkit installed.\n\n**User:**\nAlright, I think I have everything set up. How do I download and compile the CCMiner source code, and what commands need to be run?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo download and compile the CCMiner source code, you need to:\n\n1. Clone the CCMiner repository using `git clone` and specify the branch you want to use (e.g., `ARM`, `Verus2.2`, or `Verus2.2gpu`).\n2. Change into the cloned directory.\n3. Make the `build.sh`, `configure.sh`, and `autogen.sh` scripts executable using `chmod +x`.\n4.

Can you tell me what it is and how it addresses concerns about blockchain security and fee distribution?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Fee Pooling technology is a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model that strengthens blockchain security while preserving an immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees. It works by gathering all fees from transactions in a block, adding them to a common pool, and allowing the current block miner or staker to take up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool. This model addresses legitimate concerns about fee distribution and blockchain security, such as those expressed by Vitalik Buterin regarding ETH and ETH 2.0.

How does Verus Vault enhance the existing capabilities of VerusID on mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault enhances the existing capabilities of VerusID on mainnet by adding advanced time locking of identities, which complements the revocation and recovery capabilities of VerusID. This provides a more comprehensive and robust identity management system, enabling a wider range of use cases and applications.

What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about the Cheat Catcher system in Verus. Can you explain what it is and how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Cheat Catcher is a system in Verus that allows every miner or staker to catch stake cheating, which occurs when someone stakes two blocks with the same coins on two or more forks. It works by comparing orphaned stake transactions to successful stakes when they mature. If a cheating transaction is detected, the miner of the block that is 100 blocks later will mine or stake a spend transaction for that cheat into the block, and send it to a sapling address set in their wallet. Do you have any follow-up questions about the Cheat Catcher?\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if my wallet catches and spends a cheat transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf your wallet catches and spends a cheat transaction, the reward for that coinbase will be automatically shielded to your address at the same time as you win the block. You'll get the reward as a result of catching the cheat!\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that I shouldn't stake the same addresses on more than one computer at a time. Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! You should not stake the same addresses on more than one computer at a time because it creates the possibility that you will stake on two forks with the same coins, which puts your earnings at risk. It's best to keep your staking separate to avoid any potential issues.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about Stake Delegation in Verus. Can you explain what it is and how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nStake Delegation in Verus is a feature that allows you to set a parameter `-pubkey` in the command line wallet, which redirects both mining and staking rewards to the public key of an address. This public key can be obtained from an address using the `validatekey` command. It's a convenient way to manage your rewards.\n\n**User:**\nAre there any other improvements in Verus Desktop besides Cheat Catcher and Stake Delegation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are! Some other improvements include timing improvements for more efficient staking, improved support for synchronizing with non-VRSC KMD-family coins, and non-mandatory protocol updates.

With this version, all known orphaned stake transactions are compared to successful stakes when they mature, and if the orphan was trying to stake the exact same coins but on a different fork and the real fork at the same time, the miner of the block that is 100 blocks later, when that coinbase matures, will mine or stake a spend transaction for that cheat into the block, and send it to a sapling address the miner or staker has set in their wallet. If your wallet catches and spends a cheat transaction the reward for that coinbase will be automatically shielded to your address at the same time as you win the block. The early Cheat Catcher does not broadcast cheating transactions, and it will not catch all possible cheats on the network. It will make it a statistically losing proposition to cheat. This means you should not stake the same addresses on more than one computer at a time.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm having some trouble with my testnet. How can I reset my testnet on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your testnet on Verus, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Close Verus and ensure that no testnet daemon is running.\n2. Delete the following directories:\n   - On Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`\n   - On Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`\n   - On Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`\n3. Restart the testnet daemon or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native.\n\nThis should reset your testnet on Verus.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and I'm a bit confused about some of the concepts. Can you help me understand what a bridge converter liquidity pool in Verus is and how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! A bridge converter liquidity pool in Verus is a decentralized or centralized pool that enables the conversion of assets between different blockchains. It is defined as part of creating a new blockchain and runs on that blockchain. The fees generated from cross-chain conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no fees going back to the Verus blockchain. This provides seamless connectivity between blockchains. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about bridge converter liquidity pools?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that makes sense. What about blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches in Verus? How do they work and what are the benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches allow for the creation of new currencies with minimum participation or automatic refunds. You can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations, and vesting schedules. This provides a secure and fair way to launch new currencies.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. Can you tell me more about the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a decentralized network that enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. It allows for the creation of public blockchains available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can easily bridge public currencies into an organization's internal network. This provides unlimited scale and new use cases for blockchain technology. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about the Verus network?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's clear. What about Notary IDs in the Verus network? What's their purpose and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs are specified at chain definition and provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. They enable public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can easily bridge public currencies into an organization's internal network and back. This allows for seamless interoperability between blockchains. Notary IDs play a crucial role in enabling the multi-chain functionality of Verus.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. How do you lock and unlock IDs in Verus, and what are the benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, you can lock and unlock IDs using the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter. The `timelock` parameter defines the unlock height of the identity or the number of blocks to delay an ID's unlock. This provides an additional layer of security and control over ID management. It's a useful feature for managing your IDs and ensuring they're secure.", "qa_tuples": [["What is a bridge converter liquidity pool in Verus, and how does it work?", "A bridge converter liquidity pool in Verus is a decentralized or centralized pool that enables the conversion of assets between different blockchains.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to define a PBaaS blockchain using the `definecurrency` command in Verus. Can you show me an example of how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can define a PBaaS blockchain using the `definecurrency` command in Verus by passing two JSON objects as arguments. The first JSON object defines the properties of the PBaaS blockchain, and the second JSON object defines the overridable defaults for the bridge.\n\nFor example:\n```shell\n./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"options\":264,\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\"],\"conversions\":[1],\"eras\":[{\"reward\":1200000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0}],\"notaries\":[\"Notary1@\",\"Notary2@\",\"Notary3@\"],\"minnotariesconfirm\":2,\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.111:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node1@\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.112:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node2@\"}],\"gatewayconvertername\":\"Bridge\",\"gatewayconverterissuance\":1000000}' '{\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\",\"PBaaSChain\",\"USD\"],\"initialcontributions\":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],\"initialsupply\":3000000}'\n```\nThis command defines a PBaaS blockchain named \"PBaaSChain\" with the specified properties and overridable defaults for the bridge. Do you have any further questions about defining a PBaaS blockchain?\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSetting `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency in Verus means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. This is known as PROOF_CHAINID. Do you have any further questions about `proofprotocol` or minting new coins?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I export an ID to a PBaaS chain in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo export an ID to a PBaaS chain in Verus, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\n\nThis command exports the ID \"IDNAME@\" to the PBaaS chain \"PBaaSChainName\" with an amount of 100 VRSCTEST. Do you have any further questions about exporting IDs to PBaaS chains?\n\n**User:**\nWhat does it mean when the `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new currency, it means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. This is referred to as PROOF_CHAINID. Do you have any further questions about `proofprotocol`?\n\n**User:**\nHow can the controller of the chain ID mint new coins if `proofprotocol` is set to 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe controller of the chain ID can mint new coins by using the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option set to 1. For example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n\nThis will mint 10,000 new coins of the `mycoin` currency and send them to the address `mike@`. Do you have any further questions about minting new coins?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is a PBaaS blockchain, and how is it defined in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) blockchain is a type of blockchain that allows for the creation of private, permissioned blockchains. In Verus, a PBaaS blockchain is defined using a JSON object that specifies the properties of the blockchain, such as its name, options, currencies, conversions, eras, notaries, nodes, and gateway converter. Do you have any further questions about PBaaS blockchains?\n\n**User:**\nHow do I export an ID to a PBaaS chain using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the `sendcurrency` command with the `exportto` and `exportid` options. For example:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\n\nThis will export the ID `IDNAME@` to the PBaaS chain `PBaaSChainName` with an amount of 100 `vrsctest` coins. Do you have any further questions about exporting IDs to PBaaS chains?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I mint new tokens of a currency that has PROOF_CHAINID set, using the `sendcurrency` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new tokens of a currency that has PROOF_CHAINID set, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've got a few questions about identities. What happens to a locked identity when it is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a locked identity is revoked, its locked status is cleared, regardless of the time delay or unlock height. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! Can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**User:**\nMoving on to currency converters... How do I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve currencies with a specific market?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve currencies with a specific market by running a command like the following:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have a BTC/ETH market at or above the liquidity threshold. Do you have any other questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that helps! How do I send and convert funds using the `sendcurrency` API in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send and convert funds using the `sendcurrency` API in Verus by running a command like the following:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis will send 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to the address \"alice@\".\n\nYou can also use the `sendcurrency` API to convert funds to a different currency, such as:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis will convert 10 VRSCTEST to VRSC-BTC and send it to the address \"bob@\". Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that's clear. What is the purpose of the `timelock` parameter when updating an identity in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `timelock` parameter defines the unlock height of the identity or the delay in blocks before an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.

(GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!

These include increased scale over previous versions, the ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency, price-neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies, and a new \"burn\" parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API, which allows for the official removal of a currency from its supply, increasing the on-chain price for all holders.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I was also wondering, how does the conversion process work in Verus, and what fees are associated with it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, conversions are processed in groups of transactions, and all transactions in a group are solved simultaneously in all currency conversion directions. This means that all conversions are done at the same rate, with no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. There is a fee of 0.025% for conversions, which goes to miners and stakers.

This allows price neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. This version also enables a new parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API called \"burn\". If \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent, which must be a token or fractional currency is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.# An end to front running Conversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI have some questions about VerusIDs. What is the private aspect of Verus IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach Verus ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations. Do you have any other questions about VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually. How does the decentralized referral program for Verus IDs work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs cost 100 Verus to acquire, but this cost can be discounted to 80 Verus with a referral from an existing Verus ID. The cost of an ID is distributed back into the network as referral fees, mining fees, or staking fees. If you refer someone new and they purchase an ID with your ID as a referral, they will receive a 20% discount on the ID, and you will receive 20 Verus directly. The person who referred you, if there is one, will also receive 20 Verus, and the miner or staker will receive the remainder of the discounted 80 Verus cost. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat does. So, how does the referral program incentivize mining and staking on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe referral program incentivizes mining and staking on the Verus network by distributing a portion of the ID cost to miners and stakers. This can result in very high rewards for miners and stakers, especially during times when many new identities are being created. Since the rewards come from the on-chain economy, paid for by people buying identities, there is no inflation of the money supply.

The interesting twist is that all of the cost of an ID goes back into the network, either as referral fees, which are a way to get discounts or possibly even make money through referrals and built into the identity transactions themselves, or as mining and staking fees. No one besides people participating in the network as miners, stakers, or ID referrers take any proceeds from the cost of an identity. If you refer someone new and they purchase an ID with your ID as a referral, they will receive a 20% discount on the ID. In addition:1. You will receive 20 Verus directly 2.

The miner or staker will receive the remainder of the discounted 80 Verus costAs you might expect from looking at the fact that anywhere from 20 to 100 Verus goes to miners and stakers of Verus for each new identity once identities hit mainnet, some Verus blocks may have VERY high rewards for some time. The best thing about that is that regardless of how much the Verus blockchain rewards miners over and above the pre-determined coinbase reward, it will be as a result of the **on-chain economy**, paid for by people buying identities with **no inflation** of the money supply\\!

How can I prune spent wallet transactions using the `prunespentwallettransactions` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `prunespentwallettransactions` command is used to remove spent transactions from your wallet. To use it, simply run the command in the Verus CLI. If you want to prune a specific transaction, you can pass the transaction ID as an argument to the command. For example:\n\n```\nverus prunespentwallettransactions \"1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d\"\n```\n\nThis will remove the specified transaction from your wallet.

How can I initiate a rescan of the entire chain using the `rescanfromheight` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo initiate a rescan of the entire chain, you can run the `rescanfromheight` command without specifying a height. This will rescan your wallet from the genesis block, which can be useful for recovering missing transactions or fixing wallet issues.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help you understand Verus and its features. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about VerusIDs. What is the purpose of an unlock delay in a VerusID, and how can it be circumvented?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe unlock delay in a VerusID is designed to prevent unauthorized access to a user's ID by requiring a certain amount of time to pass before the ID can be unlocked and used. This delay typically allows the user to notice if someone has compromised their keys and take action to prevent theft. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover the ID, or to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking the ID.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I was wondering, what are some use cases for VerusIDs, and how do they enhance security and flexibility?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. They enable a virtually theft-proof workflow and provide solutions to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the $5 wrench attack, and identity theft. This is achieved by allowing users to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID, and by providing an unlock delay to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really powerful. How do VerusIDs enable users to create their own tokens or blockchains, and what are the benefits of this feature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs enable any user to create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain that launched it. This is possible without requiring any programming knowledge. The benefits of this feature include the ability to create custom tokens or blockchains that can interact with the Verus network, and the opportunity for projects to join the Verus community and contribute to the development of the Verus daemon.\n\n**User:**\nWow, that's really cool. What are DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets in the context of Verus, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the context of Verus, DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets are features that enable ID owners to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a really powerful feature. What is the significance of simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches in Verus, and how do they benefit users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches enable the creation of a world-class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. This feature benefits users by providing a seamless and integrated experience, with all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool earned on the new blockchain with no rent-seeking middlemen.", "qa_tuples": [["What is the purpose of an unlock delay in a VerusID, and how can it be circumvented?", "The unlock delay in a VerusID is designed to prevent unauthorized access to a user's ID by requiring a certain amount of time to pass before the ID can be unlocked and used.

Users can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the blockchain for everyone to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, without the need for intermediaries.

Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs.

If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.If you have reported a bug, since the bounties for the 0.9.5+ versions were announced, you are on the list, and someone from the Foundation will reach out to you in the near future.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about ID registration fees for fractional and centralized currencies. Can they be reduced, and if so, how?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, ID registration fees can be reduced for fractional and centralized currencies. This can be achieved through referral support, which means that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred, and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies or sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What are the limitations of IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies compared to Native IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, unlike Native IDs, which are registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent. However, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies are still valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs, as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features.\n\n**User:**\nIs there an exception to the rule that IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot create currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is an exception. *.veth gateway IDs, which are available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter, will be able to create Ethereum-mapped currencies. Registration of.veth IDs will be priced at a level to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the key difference in ID registration for decentralized fractional currencies versus centralized currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe key difference is that for fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves. For centralized currencies, the ID registration fee is sent to the currency ID.\n\n**User:**\nHow can the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies be set?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves, such as USDC or DAI.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of referral support for ID registration fees?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nReferral support allows for multiple levels of referral support (up to 5 levels), which means that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. This incentivizes referrals and promotes the adoption of currencies.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the limit on the number of levels of referral support for ID registration?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is a limit of 5 levels of referral support for ID registration, meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers.\n\n**User:**\nHow are ID registrations paid for in fully decentralized fractional currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, which reduces the supply and raises the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the significance of referrals in ID registration for fractional and centralized currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nReferrals play a role in ID registration for fractional and centralized currencies, where the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred, and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. This can lead to a reduction in the ID registration fee for users who are referred by existing IDs.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the differences between Native IDs and IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNative IDs, registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, can launch currencies on that blockchain, whereas IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies. However, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies are still valuable as revocation and recovery IDs, and can be used for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with various features.\n\n**User:**\nHow can fractional and centralized currencies with a `proofprotocol` of 2 issue IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFractional and centralized currencies with a `proofprotocol` of 2 can issue IDs as a decentralized operation. They can also sell IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, and permission from the currency identity required.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to the ID registration fee for fully decentralized fractional currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFor fully decentralized fractional currencies, the ID registration fee is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, which reduces the supply and raises the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves.

The syntax is:\n\n`disconnectnode \"node\"`\n\nWhere \"node\" is the node (see getpeerinfo for nodes)\n\nFor example, you can use `verus disconnectnode \"192.168.0.6:8233\"` to disconnect from the specified node. Do you have any more questions about using the `disconnectnode` command?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that clears things up. But I do have another question. What does the `submitmergedblock` command do, and what are the possible results?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `submitmergedblock` command submits a merged block to our chain and PBaaS chains. There are three possible results:\n\n1. Rejected: `{ rejected: \"reject reason\" }`\n2. Submission to our chain and PBaaS chains: `{ blockhash: \"hex\", accepted: true, pbaas_submissions: { \"Quantum\":\"chainID_hex\",... } }`\n3.

Do you have any further questions about virus detection or Verus downloads?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. Why might antivirus software flag Verus downloads as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAntivirus software might flag Verus downloads as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because they are mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC.

Do you have any more questions about Verus and antivirus software?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download by following these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to check the signature and hash of the downloaded file.

Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. ### Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}' ``` - **Time Delay:**  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}' ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ## Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g. BTC ETH:** ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth ``` Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.### Sending and Converting Currency **Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**The `sendcurrency` API can be u", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}
{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to learn more about the `takeoffer` command in Verus. Can you explain its purpose and what arguments it requires?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `takeoffer` command is used to accept an offer on the Verus network. It requires three arguments: `fromaddress`, a JSON object with the offer details, and two optional arguments: `returntx` and `feeamount`.\n\nThe `fromaddress` argument is a string specifying the Sapling, VerusID, or wildcard address to send funds from. The JSON object argument contains the offer details, including the transaction ID, hexadecimal transaction, and delivery information. The `returntx` boolean, if set to `true`, returns a transaction waiting for taker completion instead of posting. The `feeamount` value, if specified, sets a specific fee amount instead of using the default miner's fee.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the `takeoffer` command or its arguments?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes.

Specifically, what is VerusHash 2.1, and how does it differ from VerusHash 2.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 is an updated version of the VerusHash algorithm, which is designed to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs on the Verus network. VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly reduce the dominance of FPGAs over CPUs, and VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which is expected to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still allowing FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications.

This is beneficial to the Verus network because it promotes decentralization and prevents the concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals or groups who may have access to more advanced hardware.

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been thinking about VerusIDs, and I want to know more about their privacy features. What is meant by \"private\" in the context of VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the context of VerusIDs, \"private\" refers to the fact that each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses. These private addresses can be used as endpoints for various purposes such as messaging, financial transactions, or voting. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, which can be used to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity, once quantum secure signatures are available.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also heard that VerusIDs can have multiple primary addresses associated with them. What are the benefits of having multiple primary addresses associated with a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nHaving multiple primary addresses associated with a VerusID makes it \"powerful\" because it allows for more flexibility and control over the identity.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some of the commands in Verus. Can you help me with the `getdifficulty` command? How can I use it to retrieve the current proof-of-work difficulty?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getdifficulty` command is a simple one. You can use it to retrieve the current proof-of-work difficulty in Verus as a multiple of the minimum difficulty. This command does not require any parameters, so you can just run it as `getdifficulty` and it will return the current difficulty.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! Another command I'm not sure about is `getrawmempool`. What's the purpose of this command, and what are its optional arguments?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getrawmempool` command returns all transaction IDs in the memory pool as a JSON array of string transaction IDs. It has an optional argument `verbose`, which is a boolean that defaults to `false`. If `verbose` is set to `true`, the command returns a JSON object with detailed information about each transaction in the memory pool. So, you can run `getrawmempool` to get a list of transaction IDs, or `getrawmempool true` to get more detailed information about each transaction.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks! One more question: what information does the `getmempoolinfo` command provide about the TX memory pool in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getmempoolinfo` command returns information about the active state of the TX memory pool in Verus, including the current transaction count, the sum of all transaction sizes, and the total memory usage for the mempool.

Each transfer object contains properties such as the currency ID, value, flags, preconversion status, fees, destination currency ID, and destination address.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the `getimports` command or querying PBaaS chains?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How can I use the `getimports` command to query a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getimports` command to query a PBaaS chain by running the following command in the terminal:\n\n```\nverus getimports \"chainname\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use `curl` to send a JSON-RPC request to the Verus daemon:\n\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getimports\", \"params\": [\"chainname\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\nReplace `\"chainname\"` with the actual name of the PBaaS chain you want to query. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps a lot. One more question: what is the purpose of the `getinitialcurrencystate` command, and how does it differ from the `getimports` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getinitialcurrencystate` command returns the total amount of preconversions that have been confirmed on the blockchain for a specified PBaaS chain. This command is used to get information about chains that are not the current chain, but are being launched by it.\n\nIn contrast, the `getimports` command returns information about import transactions on the current PBaaS chain.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a custom currency on Verus. What features are available for customizing a currency launch in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe launch options in Verus provide for a range of customization features. These include maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds, pre-launch discounts for early participants, and vesting schedules in the pre-allocations using VerusIDs. These features allow you to tailor your currency launch to your specific needs.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really flexible. What's the role of Notary IDs in the Verus network, and how do they work in decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. They play a crucial role in facilitating the connection between different blockchains in the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about Verus's blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launch feature. Can you explain how that works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, a blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launch allows for minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge). This means that launch organizers can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. What's the purpose of the `setidentitytimelock` command in Verus, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `setidentitytimelock` command in Verus is used to lock and unlock IDs. There are two parameters: `unlockatblock`, which defines the unlock height of the identity, and `setunlockdelay`, which defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm still learning about the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network. Can you tell me more about Notary IDs? What role do they play in the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling the creation of public and private blockchains in the Verus network. They play a crucial role in facilitating the interaction between different blockchains on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been experimenting with the `sendcurrency` command on the Verus testnet. What's important to keep in mind when using this command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using the `sendcurrency` command on the Verus testnet, it's important to remember that all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. So, don't get too attached to your testnet coins!\n\n**User:**\nI've also been trying to understand how to lock and unlock IDs in Verus. Can you explain the process and the differences between Time Lock and Time Delay?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo lock an ID, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `flags` set to 0 and specify a `timelock` parameter, which defines the unlock height of the identity. To unlock an ID with a time delay, you can set the `flags` to 2 and specify a `timelock` parameter, which defines how many blocks to delay the ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. I've heard that Verus coin launches offer some advanced features. Can you tell me more about those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus coin launches offer several advanced features, including pre-conversions with network fees deducted, maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds, pre-launch discounts for early participants, and vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs. These features provide a high degree of customization and flexibility for coin launches on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to get a better understanding of the Verus network. Can you tell me more about what it is and its key benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a decentralized network that allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. The key benefits of this network include unlimited scale, interoperability, decentralized bridge confirmation, public and private blockchains, and easy bridging. It's a powerful platform for creating and managing multiple blockchains and currencies.\n\n**User:**\nYou mentioned earlier that IDs can be locked and unlocked. Can you explain more about how that works and what the implications are?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIDs on the Verus network can be locked and unlocked using the `updateidentity` command. There are two types of locks: Time Lock, which sets the unlock height of the identity, and Time Delay, which sets a delay in blocks before the ID can be unlocked when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. Locking an ID has the following implications: a locked identity cannot revoke itself, and revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n\n**User:**\nI've also come across the `getcurrencyconverters` API.

What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about Verus PBaaS and I'm curious, what makes it unique compared to other decentralized platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus PBaaS offers capabilities that go beyond today's decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways. It enables unlimited scale, decentralized operations, and provides truth and privacy for all. The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or CLI wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has unique capabilities such as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (VerusID), staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault), and more. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these features?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What kind of use cases can be enabled by the Verus testnet's capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus testnet's capabilities enable a wide range of use cases, including inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, and more. Its self-sovereign identities and decentralized architecture make it an ideal platform for decentralized applications, businesses, governments, and individuals looking to create customized blockchain solutions. The possibilities are endless!\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about the new Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that allows users to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming. It features a user-friendly GUI for basic operations and a command-line interface for more advanced functions. The testnet enables easy sending of currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains, as well as converting currencies to others on the network without an exchange.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds impressive. What is VerusID, and what features does it provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusID is a feature that enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. This means that users have complete control over their identities and funds, and can revoke or recover them as needed.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about Verus Vault? How does it prevent theft?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user's keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID, enabling virtually theft-proof workflow and solutions to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, and more.\n\n**User:**\nSo, what is the Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet, and what can I do with it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that allows you to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming.

What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. How does Verus DeFi address these problems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions using a particular liquidity pool and mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This prevents miners from manipulating the order of transactions to extract value or front-run other transactions. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nWhat's a simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launch, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launch is a feature of Verus that allows for the launch of a new blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. The bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but are bound to the launch of the new blockchain and run on it. All fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, ensuring seamless connectivity.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's a Verus DeFi fractional basket currency, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA Verus DeFi fractional basket currency is a type of currency that is backed by one or more asset currencies in a liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions using a particular liquidity pool and mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing issues like miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities.\n\n**User:**\nI have a few more questions. How do simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches work in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, a new blockchain can be launched simultaneously with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. The bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies. They are bound to the launch of the new blockchain, run on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, providing seamless connectivity.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the main concept behind Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi fractional basket currencies are defined with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. This allows for flexible and customizable currency conversions while ensuring simultaneous pricing and solving of conversions within a single block, addressing issues like miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the benefits of integrating DeFi liquidity pools into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIntegrating DeFi liquidity pools into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities.\n\n**User:**\nHow do bridge converter currencies differ from other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBridge converter currencies are bound to the launch of a new blockchain, run on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This allows for a more decentralized and independent experience for users of the new blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of setting minimum participation levels for blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of setting minimum participation levels for blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches is to ensure that a minimum amount of worldwide participation is required for the launch to be successful. If the minimum levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less network fees.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the concept of Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi fractional basket currencies are a type of currency that is backed by one or more asset currencies at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. This means that the liquidity pool backing the currency can be composed of multiple assets, each contributing a certain percentage to the overall liquidity. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions using a particular liquidity pool and mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing issues like miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running.\n\n**User:**\nHow do blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches work in Verus, and what are the benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches allow for the setting of required minimum levels of worldwide participation in a preferred currency on the chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what benefits does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a network that allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that are easy to set up with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private blockchain. This network enables new use cases and unlimited scale.\n\n**User:**\nI have a few more questions. What are Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi fractional basket currencies are a type of currency that can be defined with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%.

Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs have quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses, meaning they are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not have quantum-resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs themselves are secure. Additionally, a quantum-secure signature scheme will be integrated, making it possible to change an ID and retroactively make all funds sent to it quantum-resistant.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting.

Verus IDs are:- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.- **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.- **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about Verus ID. What is the main advantage of Verus ID over traditional blockchain systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne of the main advantages of Verus ID is that it provides an elegant solution to fundamental problems in traditional blockchain systems, offering quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities. Do you have any other questions about Verus ID?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What is the significance of an identity and currency address being the same in Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus ID, an identity and currency address being the same means that your friendly name can be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer. This simplifies the process of sending and receiving funds, as well as managing your identity. It makes things much more convenient and user-friendly.\n\n**User:**\nHow can identities be transferred in Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIdentities can be transferred by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party's control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so. This allows for flexibility and control over the identity.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to funds in transactions under the control of an identity when it is transferred to another party in Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using \"z_getbalance identity@\". So, everything is taken care of seamlessly.\n\n**User:**\nHow does Verus ID handle upgrades to new address types or signature algorithms, such as quantum-secure addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a new address type or signature algorithm, such as a quantum-secure address, is added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well. This means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum-secure address will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address. It's a great way to future-proof your identity and transactions.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the core advantages of Verus ID over traditional blockchain systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus ID provides several advantages over traditional blockchain systems, including:\n\n1. Identity and currency address are one and the same, allowing for a self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable identity.\n2. Each identity has a set of addresses and a minimum number of signatures required to spend or sign on behalf of the identity, providing flexibility and security.\n3. Identities are transferable, and all funds in transactions under the control of the identity will also transfer to the new party.\n4. Identities can be updated to use new address types or signature algorithms, such as quantum-secure ones, which will retroactively secure all transactions sent to the identity.\n\nThese advantages make Verus ID a powerful and flexible tool for managing your digital identity and assets.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens when an identity is transferred from one party to another?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. Additionally, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as part of the transfer, depending on the authority of the party updating the ID. It's a seamless and flexible way to transfer control of an identity.\n\n**User:**\nHow do updates to address types or signature algorithms, such as quantum-secure ones, affect transactions sent to a Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a new address type or signature algorithm, such as a quantum-secure one, is added to the Verus blockchain and an identity is updated to use it, all transactions sent to that identity will be subject to the new spend conditions. This means that if you have transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum-secure address will retroactively secure all of those transactions under the control of that address. It's a great way to future-proof your transactions and identity.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the three authorities associated with each identity in Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach identity in Verus ID has three authorities associated with it: Primary, Revocation, and Recovery.\n\n1. The **Primary** authority is the self-identity and can modify any part of the identity except its name, parent, and data under the control of the other authorities.\n2. The **Revocation** authority can revoke the primary identity, revoking access to all funds and transactions under its control.\n3. The **Recovery** authority can redefine or recover a revoked identity, but cannot change the revocation authority or modify an unrevoked identity.\n\nThese authorities provide a flexible and secure way to manage your identity and transactions.", "qa_tuples": [["What is the main advantage of Verus ID over traditional blockchain systems?", "One of the main advantages of Verus ID is that it provides an elegant solution to fundamental problems in traditional blockchain systems, offering quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities."], ["What is the significance of an identity and currency address being the same in Verus ID?", "In Verus ID, an identity and currency address being the same means that your friendly name can be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer.

Each identity must have a set of addresses (1 or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. Each identity also refers to two additional identities that have authority over:   - **Primary** - this is the self identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.   - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.   - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all. 3.

In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well.This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever released, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it\u2019s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel.

{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you explore the world of Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of the Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet. What is it, and what can I do with it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that allows users to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming. It offers a range of features, including sending currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains, converting currencies without an exchange, and more. The testnet is accessible through the Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets. Would you like to know more about its unique capabilities?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please! What are some of the unique capabilities of the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus testnet has several unique capabilities, including:\n\n1. Self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (VerusID)\n2. Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)\n\nThese capabilities enable users to have more control over their identities, funds, and assets, and provide solutions for inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, and more. Would you like me to elaborate on VerusID and Verus Vault?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I'd love to know more about VerusID. What is it, and what are its key features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusID is a self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable identity system that enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses. It allows users to have full control over their identities, with the ability to revoke and recover them as needed. This provides a high level of security and flexibility when managing digital assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What about Verus Vault? How does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a staking-capable time locking and theft prevention system that enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked. It allows users to specify an unlock delay, which can be used to prevent theft or unauthorized access to funds. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users can also create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID, making it a virtually theft-proof workflow. This adds an extra layer of security to the Verus ecosystem.

What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question! Antivirus software may flag the Verus mining software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC.

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been using `getchaintips` and I'm not entirely sure what the \"status\" field means. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe possible values for the \"status\" field returned by `getchaintips` are:\n\n1. \"invalid\" - This branch contains at least one invalid block.\n2. \"headers-only\" - Not all blocks for this branch are available, but the headers are valid.\n3. \"valid-headers\" - All blocks are available for this branch, but they were never fully validated.\n4. \"valid-fork\" - This branch is not part of the active chain, but is fully validated.\n5. \"active\" - This is the tip of the active main chain, which is certainly valid.\n\nThese statuses give you an idea of the validity and completeness of each branch in the block tree.

As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain.

They also enable the creation of private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity. This allows for a high level of flexibility and control over your digital identity.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What about VerusHash? What is the purpose of VerusHash 2.0 and VerusHash 2.1?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.0 was designed to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs on the Verus network. VerusHash 2.1 is an adjustment to the equalization technology, intended to slightly favor CPUs while still allowing FPGAs to operate with minor modifications.

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.

Specifically, I want to know about the different ways to use the `setidentitytimelock` command.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `setidentitytimelock` command has three main uses. \n\n1. You can use `verus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":1796500}' (returntx)` to lock the ID until the specified block.\n2. You can use `verus setidentitytimelock '{\"setunlockdelay\":1440}' (returntx)` to set a 1440 block unlock delay, requiring you to wait before spending funds controlled by the ID after unlocking the ID (about one day unlock time).\n3. And you can use `verus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":0}' (returntx)` to unlock an ID that has been locked with an unlock delay, and the unlock time will be set to the block height at which the ID was unlocked + the originally set unlock delay.\n\nDo you have any questions about how to use this command or what it does?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. What about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace? How does that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where you can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) directly on-chain. You can advertise your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. You can pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, and accept payment to either as well.\n\nThe marketplace is a great way to monetize your unique digital assets and identities. Do you have any questions about how to use the marketplace?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that sounds straightforward. What about Verus Vault? How does it protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows you to protect funds on a VerusID, even in the event of private key theft. When you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. You can also still receive funds. Note that enabling revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities require you to have one primary identity, and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.\n\nVerus Vault adds an extra layer of security to your funds, and gives you peace of mind even if your private key is compromised. Do you have any questions about how to use Verus Vault?", "qa_tuples": [["What are the different ways to use the `setidentitytimelock` command in Verus?", "There are three ways to use the `setidentitytimelock` command in Verus:\n\n1. `verus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":1796500}' (returntx)`: This will lock the ID until the specified block.\n2. `verus setidentitytimelock '{\"setunlockdelay\":1440}' (returntx)`: This will set a 1440 block unlock delay, requiring you to wait before spending funds controlled by the ID after unlocking the ID (about one day unlock time).\n3. `verus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":0}' (returntx)`: This will unlock an ID that has been locked with an unlock delay, and the unlock time will be set to the block height at which the ID was unlocked + the originally set unlock delay."], ["What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does it work?", "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where you can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) directly on-chain.

If the block specified is in the past, the ID will not be locked. The second example will set a 1440 block unlock delay, which will be needed to wait before spending funds controlled by the ID after unlocking the ID (about one day unlock time). The third example will unlock an ID that has been locked with an unlock delay, and the unlock time will be set to the block height at which the ID was unlocked + the originally set unlock delay.## Verus ID and NFT Marketplace Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.## Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}
{"conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm still learning about Verus. Can you tell me more about VerusID and its key features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusID is a protocol that enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. This means that VerusID allows users to create their own identities with friendly names, which can be used as cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. Would you like to know more about VerusIDs or move on to another topic?\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What is Verus Vault, and how does it protect users' funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a staking-capable time-locking and theft prevention mechanism that enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice if someone has compromised their keys. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID, enabling a virtually theft-proof workflow. Do you have any further questions about Verus Vault?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. I have another question, though. What is the significance of the Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe significance of the Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets is that it enables the creation of decentralized, community-driven liquidity pools that can be used for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. This allows for the creation of a decentralized, trustless, and permissionless financial system that is integrated into the Verus network. Would you like to know more about DeFi on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nNot right now, thanks. One last question. What is the benefit of using VerusID for cryptocurrency addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe benefit of using VerusID for cryptocurrency addresses is that it provides a friendly name strong identity that is simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. This means that users have full control over their identities and funds, and can easily recover their identities in case of key compromise or loss. It's a great way to manage your cryptocurrency addresses in a secure and convenient way.

The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems. ## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. ## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets - Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols. ## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decent", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm having some trouble running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution. Can you tell me what causes these error messages?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThese error messages are caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default on the Linux distribution.

What's going on with your wallet?\n\n**User:**\nMy wallet is stuck on a specific block number and no longer synchronizes properly. What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDon't worry, I'm here to help! If your wallet is stuck, first check if your wallet's block height is significantly lower than the current block height on the Verus explorer (more than 10 blocks behind). If it is, follow this procedure: close your wallet, add nodes to your `VRSC.conf` file, save and exit, remove the `peers.dat` file, and then restart your wallet. If the problem persists, refer to the Verus wiki for further troubleshooting. Have you tried that already?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I haven't tried that yet. But before I do, I'm not sure where to find my wallet files. Where are the standard locations for Verus wallet files on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe standard locations for Verus wallet files are:\n\n* Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC`\n* Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`\n* OS independent through Verus Desktop: Click `help`, `Show Verus data folder (default)`\n\nYou should be able to find your files in one of those locations. Now, about those nodes... do you need help getting an updated list of working nodes for your wallet?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that would be great. How can I get an updated list of working nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEasy one! You can get an updated list of working nodes by messaging `/peerinfo` in the #tipbot channel on the Verus Discord. You'll get a list of nodes that are currently working properly.\n\n**User:**\nGreat, thanks for the help! Before I start troubleshooting, is there anything I should avoid doing?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen troubleshooting your Verus wallet, make sure not to remove any files or folders other than `peers.dat`, or you may need to bootstrap your wallet. That's a good rule of thumb to keep in mind. Now, go ahead and try the troubleshooting steps I mentioned earlier, and let me know if you need any further assistance!", "qa_tuples": [["What should I do if my Verus wallet is stuck on a specific block number and no longer synchronizes properly?", "If your wallet is stuck, first check if your wallet's block height is significantly lower than the current block height on the Verus explorer (more than 10 blocks behind).

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been following the recent public network upgrade and testing. What was the outcome of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe outcome of the recent upgrade and testing on the public network was a significant learning experience, which led to the hardening of the mainnet release. Although it may have caused a delay, the learning and consequent hardening will ensure a more secure mainnet release.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to hear. What are the next steps after upgrading and testing Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe next steps are to upgrade auto-notarization to be resilient to similar issues in the future, and to prepare for the mainnet release.

Can you tell me more about those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the additional capabilities of Verus include on-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, as well as on-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, and interoperable blockchains without programming. Verus also supports on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. Can you explain how that works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. Users can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, with the option to use transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about Verus Vault. How does that protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows users to protect funds on a VerusID, even in the event of a private key being stolen. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the funds cannot be spent until it is unlocked. While locked, the funds can still be staked on the Verus network to earn rewards.

We\u2019ve learned a great deal from this upgrade, and although it may feel like a delay that we took the time to learn and address it in place on the public network before moving on, this learning and consequent hardening will ensure the mainnet release will be more hardened than ever. Next steps are to upgrade auto notarization to be resilient to anything like this level of buildup over weeks automatically and prepare the mainnet release. Join us in testing everything in the #pbaas-development channel. Contribute as you learn and build, and let's all make history together! ### Additional Verus Capabilities - On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs - On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming - On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.#### Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

For decentralized currencies, fees are burned, which on a liquidity basket, puts them into the liquidity pool for all LPs to share in earnings, and for a standard token, reduces the supply and available future registrations on that currency. On the other hand, for centralized currencies, the fee for registration is sent directly to the identity of the currency. This means that centralized currencies can collect fees, whereas decentralized currencies burn them.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What happens when an identity is registered on a centralized currency in version 1.0.1?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an identity is registered on a centralized currency in version 1.0.1, the fee for the registration is not burned into the currency, but sent directly to the identity of the currency. This is true for both token and liquidity basket currencies. This allows centralized currencies to collect fees for registrations, giving them more control over their ecosystem.", "qa_tuples": [["What new capabilities will be included in version 1.0.1 of the PBaaS protocol?", "Version 1.0.1 of the PBaaS protocol will include new capabilities that extend the idea of a centralized currency to include the ability to launch temporarily centralized currencies, including those that can issue identities.

The capabilities basically extend the idea of a centralized currency to include the ability to launch temporarily centralized currencies, including those that can issue identities. This is achieved by setting the \u201cendblock\u201d on a centralized currency launch of either a token or liquidity basket, enabling:  1) Minting of currency on demand by the identity of the currency as part of the `sendcurrency`command.  2) Burning a liquidity basket currency, but instead of affecting the supply/reserve ratio as normal burns do, the identity of a centralized currency can also burn currency to affect the reserve ratio weights of the currency.  3) Registering identities on a currency. When an identity is registered on a centralized currency, the fee for the registration is not burned into the currency, but sent directly to the identity of the currency. This is true for token or liquidity basket currencies. For decentralized currencies, fees are burned, which on a liquidity basket, puts them into the liquidity pool for all LPs to share in earnings, and for a standard token, reduces the supply and available future registrations on that currency.  4) In v1.0.1, setting the endblock of a centralized currency causes all centralized capabilities of the same ID to end, converting it in whatever state it currently is in a decentralized currency with no special control over it after that occurs by any identity on the network.  5) v1.0.0 did not allow a decentralized non-liquidity token to register identities. v1.0.1 does.Thanks to ejuliano#8606 for suggesting the initial idea that led to the realization that these features could be added quite easily and with very little protocol risk. All of these new capabilities have had full coverage testing and validation over the past week thanks to @Asherda\u2019s leadership on that front.Meanwhile, @alexenglish, @monkins1010, @asherda, quipacorn#5205, and others have been working on the Ethereum bridge deployment in preparation for this release. The testnet will transition to the v1.0.1 protocol with no reset required, Monday, May 8, 2023 4:00:00 PM, UTC. ### Additional Verus Capabilities - On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs - On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming - On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles", "source_filename": "./raw_txt_input/release_notes.md"}

What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to send VRSCTEST to an address on a PBaaSChain using Verus. Do you know how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST to an address on a PBaaSChain using the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\",\"amount\":10, \"exportto\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\"}]'\n```\n\nThis command will send 10 units of VRSCTEST to the specified address on the PBaaSChain. Do you have any other questions about sending currency with Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. How can I convert VRSCTEST to a new token called \"NEWCOIN\" using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to a new token called \"NEWCOIN\" using the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\n\nThis command will convert 10 units of VRSCTEST to NEWCOIN and send it to the specified address. Do you have any other questions about converting currencies with Verus?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. I do have a question about defining currencies with Verus, though. What does the `OPTION_ID_STAKING` flag do when defining a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_ID_STAKING` flag, when set to 4, enables equal staking for all IDs on the chain, rather than value-based staking. This means that each ID has an equal weight in the staking process, regardless of the amount of currency held.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. What about the `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` flag? What does that do when defining a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` flag, when set to 1, allows reserve conversion using base calculations. This means that the currency can be divided into fractional units, and conversions can be performed using these base calculations.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about Verus or its features!", "qa_tuples": [["How can I send VRSCTEST to an address on a PBaaSChain using Verus?", "You can send VRSCTEST to an address on a PBaaSChain using the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\",\"amount\":10, \"exportto\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\"}]'\n```"], ["How can I convert VRSCTEST to a new token called \"NEWCOIN\" using Verus?", "You can convert VRSCTEST to a new token called \"NEWCOIN\" using the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```"], ["What does the `OPTION_ID_STAKING` flag do when defining a currency?", "The `OPTION_ID_STAKING` flag, when set to 4, enables equal staking for all IDs on the chain, rather than value-based staking.
