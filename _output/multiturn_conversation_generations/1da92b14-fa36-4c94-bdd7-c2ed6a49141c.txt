    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    What does the `definechain` command do in Verus, and how is it used?


    **ANSWER:**

    The `definechain` command in Verus is used to define a new chain and its properties.
    It takes a JSON object as an argument, which specifies the chain''s name, payment
    address, premine amount, initial contribution, conversion rate, and other parameters.
    This command is used to create a new chain with specific settings and rules.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the purpose of the `premine` parameter in the `definechain` command?


    **ANSWER:**

    The `premine` parameter in the `definechain` command specifies the amount of native
    chain currency that will be emitted to the payment address at the launch of the
    chain. This is essentially a pre-mine of the chain''s currency, which can be used
    for various purposes, such as funding the chain''s development or providing initial
    liquidity.



    **QUESTION:**

    How does the conversion process work when contributing to a chain in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    When contributing to a chain in Verus, the contribution is converted to the native
    chain currency at a 1:1 conversion price. The converted amount is then added to
    the chain''s reserve deposits. The more contributions made to the chain, the higher
    the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met,
    the chain will fail to start, and all contributions can be spent back to the original
    contributors.



    **QUESTION:**

    How does the reserve ratio affect the price of a currency in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    The reserve ratio in Verus affects the price of a currency by determining the
    volatility of the price when converting to or from reserves. A currency with a
    reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its
    reserve, while a currency with a lower reserve ratio (e.g., 0.1 or 10%) will experience
    more price volatility when converted to or from its reserve. This means that the
    price of a currency will rise or fall depending on the amount of conversion relative
    to the total currency reserves on deposit.



    **QUESTION:**

    How do I connect to a defined chain in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    To connect to a defined chain in Verus, you can use the command `./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN`,
    replacing `SOMECOIN` with the name of the chain you want to connect to. This will
    create a local config file on first connection, and you will not need to run VRSCTEST
    to connect again. However, VRSCTEST will still be needed to merge mine.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the purpose of the `definechain` command in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    The `definechain` command is used to define a new chain in Verus, specifying its
    properties and parameters. This command is used to create a new chain with its
    own set of rules, such as payment addresses, premine amounts, conversion rates,
    and node configurations.



    **QUESTION:**

    What are some common parameters that can be specified when defining a new chain
    in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    Some common parameters that can be specified when defining a new chain in Verus
    include:


    * `name`: The name of the chain

    * `paymentaddress`: The address that will receive payment for transactions on
    the chain

    * `premine`: The amount of currency that will be premined to the payment address

    * `initialcontribution`: The initial contribution amount for the chain

    * `conversion`: The conversion rate for contributions to the native chain currency

    * `minpreconvert` and `maxpreconvert`: The minimum and maximum amounts that can
    be converted to the native chain currency

    * `launchfee`: The fee for launching the chain

    * `billingperiod`: The billing period for the chain

    * `notarizationreward`: The reward for notarizing blocks on the chain

    * `eras`: An array of era definitions, specifying the block reward, decay, halving,
    and end of each era

    * `nodes`: An array of node definitions, specifying the network addresses and
    payment addresses for each node



    **QUESTION:**

    What happens if the minimum contributions are not met when defining a new chain
    in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    If the minimum contributions are not met when defining a new chain in Verus, the
    chain will fail to start, and all contributions can be spent back to the original
    contributors.



    **QUESTION:**

    How can I connect to a defined chain in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    To connect to a defined chain in Verus, you can use the command `./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN`,
    where `SOMECOIN` is the name of the chain you want to connect to. On first connection,
    a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect.
    However, it will be needed to merge mine.



    **QUESTION:**

    How can I define a new chain using Verus, and what are the main properties of
    a chain definition?


    **ANSWER:**

    You can define a new chain using Verus by running the `definechain` command with
    a JSON object that specifies the chain''s properties. Here''s an example:

    ```

    ./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain ''{"name":"RESERVEWITHPREMINE","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM","premine":50000000000000,"initialcontribution":5000000000000,"conversion":100000000,"minpreconvert":45000000000000,"maxpreconvert":100000000000000,"launchfee":0,"billingperiod":14400,"notarizationreward":100000000000,"eras":[{"reward":5000000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0,"eraoptions":1}],"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"ipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"},
    {"networkaddress":"2ndipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"}]}''

    ```

    The main properties of a chain definition include:

    1. `name`: The name of the chain.

    2. `paymentaddress`: The address that will receive premine and fees.

    3. `premine`: The amount of premine for the chain.

    4. `initialcontribution`: The initial contribution required to start the chain.

    5. `conversion`: The conversion rate from the contribution currency to the native
    chain currency.

    6. `minpreconvert` and `maxpreconvert`: The minimum and maximum amounts that can
    be converted to the native chain currency.

    7. `launchfee`: The fee for launching the chain.

    8. `billingperiod`: The billing period for the chain.

    9. `notarizationreward`: The reward for notarizing blocks on the chain.

    10. `eras`: An array of objects defining the reward schedule for each era of the
    chain.

    11. `nodes`: An array of objects defining the nodes on the chain, including their
    network addresses and payment addresses.



    **QUESTION:**

    How can I connect to a chain once it''s defined, and what''s the role of the local
    config file?


    **ANSWER:**

    Once a chain is defined, you can connect to it by running the command `./verusd
    -chain=SOMECOIN`, replacing `SOMECOIN` with the name of the chain. The first time
    you connect to a chain, a local config file is created in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME`
    directory, which is the home directory for the PBaaS chain. The presence of a
    correct config file enables the chain to load as an independent chain. After the
    initial connection, you don''t need to run VRSCTEST to connect to the chain, but
    you will need it to merge mine.



    **QUESTION:**

    What''s the purpose of the `premine` and `initialcontribution` properties in a
    chain definition, and how do they affect the chain''s operation?


    **ANSWER:**

    The! `premine` property specifies the amount of premine for the chain, which is
    the initial allocation of native chain currency to a specific address. The `initialcontribution`
    property specifies the initial contribution required to start the chain. If the
    minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start, and all contributions
    can be spent back to the original contributors. The more contributions on this
    chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. The initial price in reserve
    at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the
    early blocks that will come in as reserve currency.'

    You can define a new chain using Verus by running the `definechain` command with
    a JSON object that specifies the chain''s properties. Here''s an example:

    ```

    ./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain ''{"name":"RESERVEWITHPREMINE","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM","premine":50000000000000,"initialcontribution":5000000000000,"conversion":100000000,"minpreconvert":45000000000000,"maxpreconvert":100000000000000,"launchfee":0,"billingperiod":14400,"notarizationreward":100000000000,"eras":[{"reward":5000000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0,"eraoptions":1}],"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"ipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"},
    {"networkaddress":"2ndipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"}]}''

    ```

    The main properties of a chain definition include the chain name, payment address,
    premine amount, initial contribution, conversion rate, minimum and maximum pre-convert
    amounts, launch fee, billing period, notarization reward, era definitions, and
    node definitions.


    **User:**

    How can I connect to a chain once it''s defined, and what''s the role of the local
    config file?


    **AI Assistant:**

    Once a chain is defined, you can connect to it by running the command `./verusd
    -chain=SOMECOIN`, replacing `SOMECOIN` with the name of the chain. The first time
    you connect to a chain, a local config file is created in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME`
    directory, which is the home directory for the PBaaS chain. The presence of a
    correct config file enables the chain to load as an independent chain. After the
    initial connection, you don''t need to run VRSCTEST to connect to the chain, but
    you will need it to merge mine.


    **User:**

    What''s the purpose of the `premine` and `initialcontribution` properties in a
    chain definition, and how do they affect the chain''s operation?


    **AI Assistant:**

    The `premine` property specifies the amount of premine for the chain, which is
    the initial allocation of native chain currency to a specific address. The `initialcontribution`
    property specifies the initial contribution required to start the chain. If the
    minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start, and all contributions
    can be spent back to the original contributors. The more contributions on this
    chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. The initial price in reserve
    at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the
    early blocks that will come in as reserve currency.'
