    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    How do I define a currency in Verus, and what are some of the key properties that
    I need to specify?


    **ANSWER:**

    To define a currency in Verus, you can use the `definecurrency` command. Some
    of the key properties that you need to specify include:


    * `name`: The name of the currency.

    * `options`: An integer that specifies various options for the currency.

    * `currencies`: An array of currencies that the new currency can be converted
    to.

    * `conversions`: An array of conversion ratios between the new currency and the
    currencies specified in the `currencies` array.

    * `minpreconversion`: The minimum amount of the currency that needs to be preconverted
    to launch the currency.

    * `preallocations`: An array of preallocations of the currency to specific IDs.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the relationship between an ID and a currency in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    In Verus, to create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same
    name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that
    name, and they can only do so once.



    **QUESTION:**

    How can I convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    To convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency in Verus, you can use the `sendcurrency`
    command. You can park your conversion until the token launches, and once it launches,
    you will either receive the converted amount of the new currency or have your
    VRSCTEST back. The command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, for example, would be:

    ```

    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]''

    ```



    **QUESTION:**

    What happens when I define a currency in Verus, and what are the requirements
    for launching a currency?


    **ANSWER:**

    When you define a currency in Verus, you need to fund the identity of the currency
    with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency
    launch. The currency launch will start at 50 blocks from when the transaction
    was made (default), and it must have a minimum amount of VRSCTEST preconverted
    to the new currency at a specified conversion rate in order to launch. The mining
    process earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting
    VRSCTEST to the new currency.



    **QUESTION:**

    How can I create a new token in Verus that can be converted to with either GOLD
    or VRSCTEST?


    **ANSWER:**

    To create a new token in Verus that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST,
    you can use the `definecurrency` command. You need to specify the name of the
    token, the options, the proof protocol, the currencies that the token can be converted
    to, and the minimum preconversion amounts. For example:

    ```

    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency ''{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest",
    "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000''

    ```

    In this example, the proof protocol is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID, allowing
    the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins.'
