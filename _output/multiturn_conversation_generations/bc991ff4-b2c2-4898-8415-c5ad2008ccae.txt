    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

    **QUESTION:**

    How do you define a PBaaS blockchain using the command line and Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    You can define a PBaaS blockchain using the `definecurrency` command in Verus.
    The command takes two JSON objects as arguments: one for the PBaaS blockchain
    definition and another for the overridable defaults of the bridge. Here''s an
    example:

    ```

    ./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency ''{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}''
    ''{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}''

    ```



    **QUESTION:**

    What is an important limitation to be aware of when creating a multi-currency
    setup in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    One important limitation to be aware of is that you cannot create a currency from
    an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated
    ID. This can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used, and is
    not supported for creating currencies. It is generally advised to avoid using
    an i-address as the name of an ID.



    **QUESTION:**

    What are the key components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    The key components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus include:


    1. `name`: The name of the blockchain.

    2. `options`: An integer specifying the blockchain''s options.

    3. `currencies`: An array of currencies that the blockchain''s native currency
    can be converted into.

    4. `conversions`: An array of conversion ratios between the blockchain''s native
    currency and each currency on the chain.

    5. `eras`: An array of era definitions, including block reward, reward decay,
    halving, and era end.

    6. `notaries`: An array of VerusIDs that will serve as notaries on the chain.

    7. `minnotariesconfirm`: An integer specifying the minimum number of notaries
    needed to confirm a block.

    identities.

    9. `gatewayconvertername` and `gatewayconverterissuance`: Settings for the bridge
    that connects the PBaaS chain to other chains.



    **QUESTION:**

    What are the limitations of creating a currency from an ID with a properly encoded
    i-address as its actual name in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    In Verus, creating a currency from an ID with a properly encoded i-address as
    its actual name is not supported and can cause problems. This is because an i-address
    is used to calculate the ID based on its name registration, and using an i-address
    as a currency name can lead to confusion and errors. It is generally advised to
    avoid using i-addresses as currency names.



    **QUESTION:**

    Why is it recommended to avoid using i-addresses as currency names in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    Using an i-address as a currency name can lead to confusion and errors, as an
    i-address is used to calculate the ID based on its name registration. This can
    cause issues whenever an i-address or name may be used, and is not supported for
    creating currencies. To avoid user confusion, Verus is expanding the set of characters
    that will not be allowed for currency registrations.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the purpose of the `definecurrency` command in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    The `definecurrency` command is used to define a new PBaaS blockchain and its
    properties, such as its name, options, currencies, conversions, eras, notaries,
    nodes, and gateway converter settings.



    **QUESTION:**

    What are the components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    A PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus consists of several components, including:

    on the chain, as well as their IDs

    9. `gatewayconvertername`: the name of the bridge converter

    10. `gatewayconverterissuance`: the initial issuance of the bridge converter



    **QUESTION:**

    What is a limitation to be aware of when creating a currency from an ID in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    One limitation to be aware of is that you will not be able to make a currency
    from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated
    ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only
    be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address
    calculated based on its name registration. It is generally not recommended to
    create an ID with an i-address as its name, as it can cause problems in various
    cases and will not be supported for creating currencies.'

    Hey there! I''m here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What''s
    on your mind today?


    **User:**

    Hi! I''m trying to set up a PBaaS blockchain in Verus. Can you walk me through
    the key components of a PBaaS blockchain definition?


    **AI Assistant:**

    The key components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus include:


    1. `name`: The name of the chain.

    2. `options`: An integer value that configures the chain''s properties.

    3. `currencies`: An array of currencies that the chain''s native currency can
    be converted into.

    4. `conversions`: An array of conversion ratios between the chain''s native currency
    and each currency on the chain.

    5. `eras`: An array of objects defining the block reward, reward decay, halving,
    and end of each "era" in the chain''s lifecycle.

    6. `notaries`: An array of VerusIDs that serve as notaries on the chain.

    7. `minnotariesconfirm`: An integer value specifying the minimum number of notaries
    needed to confirm a block.

    8. `nodes`: An array of objects describing the network addresses and IDs of the
    nodes on the chain.

    9. `gatewayconvertername`: The name of the bridge converter.

    10. `gatewayconverterissuance`: The initial issuance of the bridge converter''s
    native token.


    Does that help? Do you have any further questions about PBaaS blockchain definitions?


    **User:**

    Yeah, that helps a lot! What are the override defaults for the bridge definition
    in a PBaaS blockchain?


    **AI Assistant:**

    The override defaults for the bridge definition in a PBaaS blockchain include:


    1. `currencies`: An array of currency tickers that the bridge supports.

    2. `initialcontributions`: An array of initial liquidity values for each currency
    in the bridge.

    3. `initialsupply`: The initial supply of the bridge''s native token.


    These defaults can be overridden when defining the bridge. Do you have any more
    questions about bridge definitions or PBaaS blockchains?


    **User:**

    What''s a limitation to be aware of when creating a multi-currency in Verus?


    **AI Assistant:**

    One limitation to be aware of when creating a multi-currency in Verus is that
    you cannot make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as
    its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when
    referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency
    or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.
    It is generally not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name,
    as it can cause problems in various cases and will not be supported for creating
    currencies.'
