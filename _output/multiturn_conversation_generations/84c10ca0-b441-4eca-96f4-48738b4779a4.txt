    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

    Hi! I''m here to help you with any Verus-related questions you might have. What''s
    on your mind today?


    **User:**

    I''ve been mining and I want to make sure all my rewards go to a single wallet.
    How can I direct all my mined rewards to a single Verus wallet?


    **AI Assistant:**

    To direct all your mined rewards to a single Verus wallet, follow these steps:
    You can set the `stakingaddress` parameter in your `VRSC.conf` file to the address
    of the wallet where you want to receive your rewards. This will ensure that all
    your mined rewards are sent to that specific wallet.


    **User:**

    Thanks for that! I''ve been having some issues with my wallet, actually. Sometimes
    I get an error saying my wallet.dat is not matching the blockchain. What should
    I do if I encounter this error?


    **AI Assistant:**

    To resolve this error, restart the wallet with the `-reindex` parameter. This
    will force the wallet to re-index the blockchain, which should resolve any inconsistencies
    between your wallet.dat file and the blockchain.

    **User:**

    I''m also having trouble distinguishing between staked and mined coins in my Verus
    wallet. How can I distinguish between staked and mined coins in my Verus wallet?


    **AI Assistant:**

    In your Verus wallet, staked coins are labeled as "Stake" and mined coins are
    labeled as "Mint". You can also use the `gettransaction` command in the Verus
    CLI to get more information about a specific transaction, including whether it
    was staked or mined.


    **User:**

    What should I do if I end up on my own fork because of a network issue or having
    an old version of the wallet?


    **AI Assistant:**

    If you end up on your own fork, you should stop your wallet and delete the `blocks`
    and `chainstate` directories. Then, restart your wallet with the `-reindex` parameter.
    This should force your wallet to re-sync with the main blockchain and abandon
    the fork.


    **User:**

    What are some useful Verus CLI commands that I should know about?


    **AI Assistant:**

    Some useful Verus CLI commands include `getinfo`, `getbalance`, `sendtoaddress`,

    check your balance, and perform transactions.


    **User:**

    How can I tell if a block was minted, and what does it mean for my staking reward?


    **AI Assistant:**

    When a block is minted, it means that a new block has been added to the blockchain,
    and the miner who minted the block has received a staking reward. To check if
    a block was minted, you can use the `getblock` command in the Verus CLI to view
    the block''s details. If you were the one who minted the block, you should receive
    a staking reward, which will be credited to your wallet.'
