    "What is an important consideration when using friendly-name private addresses with z-addresses in Verus?",
    "When using friendly-name private addresses with z-addresses in Verus, it is important to consider that due to the zero-knowledge nature of z-addresses, if you revoke and recover an ID, funds held on a private address or endpoint may not be redirected to the newly recovered ID unless you still have control over the z-address itself. This is a fundamental limitation of zero-knowledge privacy.",
    "**NOTE:** Due to the zero knowledge nature of z-addresses, a z-address is an endpoint in your VerusID which can be changed if you revoke and recover an ID, funds held on a private address or endpoint are not able to be redirected to the newly recovered ID unless you still have control over the z-address itself. Transparent funds controlled by an ID are recovered when the ID is revoked and recovered, even if you have lost the keys. This is a fundamental limitation of zero-knowledge privacy, not an error and not something to be fixed. Please consider this when using friendly-name private addresses as funds and not just message endpoints.## The Verus DeFi Testnet -- THERE IS NO TESTNET RESET All new 'sendcurrency' features described above now work on both mainnet and testnet. In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well.This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever released, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it\u2019s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel. You can use this link as an invite to the Verus Discord: https://discord.gg/gecZsCf- **DeFi and cross-currency liquidity integrated with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm** - This is a massive set of platform capabilities that take DeFi further than any project in crypto today. We will list it here and describe it below. Using it is simple. Understanding the implications of what such a protocol can do when rent free and integrated in a truly decentralized public blockchain is a process of realizations that is likely to be similar to layers of an onion. We will do our best to explain below.",
