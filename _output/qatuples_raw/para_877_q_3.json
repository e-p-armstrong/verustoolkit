    "What should I do if my antivirus software flags the software as malicious?",
    "If your antivirus software flags the software as malicious, it may be a false positive. Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program) because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. You can review the resources linked in the text to learn more about these false positives.",
