    "What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace?",
    "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain. It allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, with the option to pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address.",
    "We will leave the current testnet running and fully functional, as we prepare the next release, which we expect to be ready for a mainnet PBaaS activation. We will effectively abandon this testnet and leave it running long enough to overlap with the next and final testnet instance before PBaaS release. You should be able to actually send currencies over from the first testnet to the second via Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet, even map some VRSCTEST-CLASSIC or something else through the bridge, but we do not intend to update that daemon again, or continue to run nodes or notaries on the old test network for more than a couple weeks after the new testnet goes live.Thanks for all your help and contributions, both already made and those to come for this historic upcoming release!### Additional Verus Capabilities - On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs - On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming - On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.#### Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.",
