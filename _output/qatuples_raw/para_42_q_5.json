    "How do I specify a public key to receive mining and staking rewards using the Verus command line?",
    "You can specify a public key to receive mining and staking rewards using the `-pubkey` option followed by the hexadecimal public key. For example, `-pubkey=0xf09...` would set the public key to `0xf09...`.",
