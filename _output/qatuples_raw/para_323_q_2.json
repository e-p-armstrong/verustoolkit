    "What issues were encountered with the auto-notarization protocol on TestNet?",
    "Two issues were encountered: a notarization bug that caused notarizations to fork, and a problem with the protocol taking too long and generating too large proofs. These issues have been addressed and will be optimized in the next few days.",
    "This release also includes an important update of the OpenSSL library, which Verus uses for encrypted node connections and addresses a buffer overflow vulnerability in that library.#### What\u2019s New for TestNet This release re-enables cross-chain notarization, and represents the completion of a great deal of learning from the first roll out of auto notarization. Basically, we encountered two issues:1) There was a notarization bug in a significantly updated approach that caused notarizations to fork, effectively simulating a worst case, unmitigated attack on the notarization system. While that did not cause the system to fail per se, it resulted in the generation of many perceived, although not real, notarization forks on the network.2) Due to our effort to err on the side of more evidence than we believed was sufficient with auto notarization, then optimize to reduce the proofs required, the protocol was simply taking too long and generating too large proofs to be reasonable, required, or what we need on mainnet in any real scenario.As a result, we will take a few days to change some parameters in the auto notarization protocol that will both reduce the total and maximum amount of proof required, as well as provide a sufficient level of cryptographic proof, similar in strength to the current proof model with more efficient and selective proof choices. We don\u2019t expect this important step to take long, and until then, we will leave testnet on the pre-PBaaS to mainnet preparatory state.The good news is that since we have the new Verus Notification Oracle technology, we can enable everyone running on the current testnet to remain connected as all cross-chain transactions to and from PBaaS chains will resume flowing. We are still seeing an error in BridgeKeeper, but since this release includes a mainnet security update and addresses all other known issues on testnet, we\u2019ll release this immediately and update Bridgekeeper as soon as possible. In order to merge mine PBaaS chains with Verus or the Ethereum bridge to Goerli going forward, you will need to update to v0.9.9-2, which everyone should run for mainnet anyhow.Once you update, please feel free to resume merge mining all PBaaS chains and Verus. You will need to wait for the BridgeKeeper update to be able to merge mine and stake with Ethereum\u2019s Goerli.",
