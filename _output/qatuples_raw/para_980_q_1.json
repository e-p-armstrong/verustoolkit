Please note that this is a test release intended to use for testing and development with public blockchains as a service (PBaaS). Although this version does also work with Verus mainnet, it does not support PBaaS on mainnet and is not an official release. As always, use at your own risk. Do not use as main wallet**Sample chain definition**: ``` ./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [{\"reward\" : 10000000000}], \"notarizationreward\" : 1440000000, \"billingperiod\" : 1440, \"nodes\" : [{\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2500\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"\"}, {\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2501\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"RDyDzC5JB66Y29fzBkamywqEn1PJXTzj8B\"}]}' ``` Maximum of 3 eras Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations. Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization. VRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:** ``` ./verusd-chain=SOMECOIN ``` On first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
