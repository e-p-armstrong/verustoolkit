    "What is the basic structure of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus?",
    "A PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus consists of two main parts: the blockchain definition and the bridge definition. The blockchain definition includes properties such as:\n\n* `name`: the name of the chain\n* `options`: an integer specifying the chain's options\n* `currencies`: an array of currencies that can be converted to the chain's native currency\n* `conversions`: an array specifying the conversion ratios between the chain's native currency and each currency on the chain\n* `eras`: an array defining the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each \"era\" in the chain's lifecycle\n* `notaries`: an array of VerusIDs serving as notaries on the chain\n* `minnotariesconfirm`: an integer specifying the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block\n* `nodes`: an array describing the network addresses of the nodes on the chain, as well as their IDs\n* `gatewayconvertername`: the name of the bridge\n* `gatewayconverterissuance`: the initial issuance of the bridge's native token\n\nThe bridge definition includes properties such as:\n\n* `currencies`: an array of currencies supported by the bridge\n* `initialcontributions`: an array specifying the initial liquidity for each currency in the bridge\n* `initialsupply`: the initial supply of the bridge's native token",

(GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.",
