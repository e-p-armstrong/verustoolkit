    "What issues does v0.9.9 fix on the testnet, and what benefits can I expect from upgrading to this version?",
    "v0.9.9 fixes all known testnet issues, including syncing and cross-chain operation issues. Upgrading to this version will allow you to sync fully and resume all cross-chain operations on the Verus test network. Additionally, auto-notarization will be enabled on testnet when the testfork executes, and all witnessed cross-chain operations should be able to resume without difficulty.",
    "1. **Preparing for #LaunchPBaaS**: v0.9.9 is MANDATORY, meaning that you will need to upgrade to this release ASAP to stay reliably connected to mainnet after the first preparatory PBaaS upgrade is triggered, both for testnet and mainnet. While the current deadline for being upgraded is in 1 week, it is a soft fork that we would like to activate as soon as possible, and if we can believe that we have more than 50% of the validating network updated earlier than 1 week, we will trigger the activation with our Oracle Notification Technology described in 2. **(Mainnet + Testnet)**2. **Enabling Seamless Decentralized Network Upgrades**: This release includes a Verus invention of consensus-capable oracle notifications built into the core protocol, which enable dynamic coordinated consensus changes that can be triggered at a time decided after the actual release which enables them, all without any compromise on decentralization. The Verus Community may decide that we are ready to go earlier than one week on this upgrade and activate it, even before its scheduled time. The good news is that this first test upgrade will primarily affect testnet and prepare for the mainnet PBaaS upgrade, so it is a perfect test case for a mainnet test run before we #LaunchPBaaS. This release actually has the ability to upgrade mainnet to PBaaS, but we believe it is prudent to have at least some time on this new protocol on testnet before the v1.0 release, which will upgrade mainnet. If we make no additional changes to the protocol in this release, which we do not intend to do at this time, this version may be able to follow the v1.0 upgrade. If we determine that it cannot, the oracle upgrade technology will enable the daemon to recognize that it is not capable and request that the user upgrade to a newer version without requiring a bootstrap for the upgrade. **(Mainnet + Testnet)**3. **This upgrade fixes all known testnet issues with no reset**: Using v0.9.9, you should be able to sync fully and resume all cross-chain operations on the Verus test network, if you were not able to perform cross-chain operations or sync to the network on the prior version. As mentioned, someone seems to have mined with an intermediate version along the way on testnet and made the network unavailable without a bootstrap on the older daemon. This version should fix that issue as well as any cross-chain difficulties. Auto-notarization will be enabled on testnet in sync when the testfork executes. Until then, all witnessed cross-chain operations should be able to resume, if they have had difficulty. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**",
