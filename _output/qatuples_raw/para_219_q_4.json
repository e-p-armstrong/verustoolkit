    "What is Verus Vault and how does it protect funds on a VerusID?",
    "Verus Vault is a feature that allows users to protect funds on a VerusID even from theft of a private key. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the user cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. However, the user can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. To enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities, users need to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.",
