However, the algo is carefully designed for CPUs, and they still substantially outrange GPUs. ARM mining works in general, but although fairly efficient, without high hashrates. FPGAs can mine this coin, but don't outperform CPUs by much.##### Miners: Besides solo-mining with Verus Desktop or CLI wallet, you can use: ccminer for CPU (efficient for most modern CPUs) or GPU https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer/releases; nheqminer https://github.com/VerusCoin/nheqminer/releases (for Windows, Linux, and MacOS);",
