    "How can I use the `getbalance` command in Verus to get the total available balance in my wallet?",
    "You can use the `getbalance` command in Verus to get the total available balance in your wallet by running the following command:\n```\nverus getbalance\n```\nThis will return the total amount in VRSC received for your default account. You can also specify an account by replacing the `*` with the account name, like this:\n```\nverus getbalance \"*\"\n```\nAdditionally, you can specify the minimum number of confirmations required for the balance by adding a second argument, like this:\n```\nverus getbalance \"*\" 6\n```\nThis will return the total amount in VRSC received for your default account, with at least 6 confirmations.",
