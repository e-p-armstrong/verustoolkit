    "What kind of warnings may I encounter when installing the software on my system?",
    "Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). These warnings are triggered because the software is related to mining, which can be used to exploit a system if installed by a third party. However, these warnings are false positives, and the software is safe to use.",
