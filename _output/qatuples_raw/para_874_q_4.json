    "What are some limitations of traditional blockchain-based signature systems?",
    "Traditional blockchain-based signature systems, such as those used in Bitcoin, lack critical capabilities to make them suitable as an actual identity. Some of these limitations include:\n\n* The inability to recover from loss or theft of private keys\n* Lack of friendly name aliases\n* Limited multi-sig signing capabilities\n* No support for updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.\n\nVerus ID addresses these limitations by providing a more comprehensive identity management system.",
    "## Verifying Downloads A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, is included for each download. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". 1) Extract downloaded archive 2) Verify signature for the extracted archive using the extracted textfile. 3) Extract archive to desired directory ### CLI examples **Verifying file directly** ``` ./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" ATPPDgABQR/xBtY9wU+RmBJqX5Y6AWdPlw9nJShSAFpyGzu50ufFR3pTC1s1Wyk96zGTCZqMUzaurrbtu4ysrKZNr7FUq/O/ /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.6.4-3-amd64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.6.4-3-amd64.tar.gz ``` **Verifying using a checksum** ``` ./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" ATPPDgABQR/xBtY9wU+RmBJqX5Y6AWdPlw9nJShSAFpyGzu50ufFR3pTC1s1Wyk96zGTCZqMUzaurrbtu4ysrKZNr7FUq/O/ 3e5cc7bea46c6869545a0a886d66fdbf21fb2800761e3dca6f626046681ee26e ```**The result will be true if the signature is valid.** ``` true ``` ## New in v0.6.4-1 - Added `convertpassphrase` api, allowing wif key exports of electrum wallet passphrases# Verus CLI v0.6.4-1### Worldwide Verifiable Digital Signatures for All! Verus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer the first worldwide verifiable, decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft.Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables. It is also the foundation upon which many new applications and additional capabilities can be built.",
