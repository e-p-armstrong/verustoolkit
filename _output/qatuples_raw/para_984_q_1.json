Please note that this is a test release intended to use with test chains. We do not advise using it for main net. Do not use as main wallet**Sample chain definition**: ``` ./komodo-cli -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [{\"reward\" : 10000000000}], \"notarizationreward\" : 1440000000, \"billingperiod\" : 1440, \"nodes\" : [{\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2500\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"\"}, {\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2501\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"RDyDzC5JB66Y29fzBkamywqEn1PJXTzj8B\"}]}' ``` Maximum of 3 eras Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations. Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization. VRSCTEST are not paid out yet, but they are needed them in wallet to make a chain.**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:** ``` ./komodod -chain=SOMECOIN ``` On first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
