It also includes the ability to export an ID from one chain to another, using the \u201cexportid\u201d:true parameter in sendcurrency, enabling cross-chain use of VerusIDs. With this release, we will be resetting the Verus testnet. To use the new testnet, you must make sure to delete the vrsctest and .verustest/pbaas or VerusTest\\pbaas folders beforehand.In addition to being prepared for the Ethereum bridge launch, this release adds some new testnet capabilities, including the ability to send to IDs cross chain and export IDs from chain to chain using the `\u201cexportid\u201d:true` parameter with `sendcurrency`. IDs only need to be exported once and can then be used and managed directly as a forked ID on the destination chain.## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain  ```  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'  ```",
