    "What is meant by \"private\" in the context of VerusIDs?",
    "In the context of VerusIDs, \"private\" refers to the fact that each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses. These private addresses can be used as endpoints for various purposes such as messaging, financial transactions, or voting. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, which can be used to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity, once quantum secure signatures are available.",
    "* Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available. * Powerful - Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of M multisig controls for its primary addresses.",
