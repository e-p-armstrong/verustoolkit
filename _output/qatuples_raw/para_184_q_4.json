    "# Release Notes## v1.0.7 Announcing v1.0.7 - UPGRADE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET, MANDATORY FOR CONTINUED TESTNET USEALL PBAAS AND DEFI FUNCTIONS HAVE NOW RESUMED ON MAINNET. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING v1.0.6 OR LATER AT THIS TIMETESTNET USERS SHOULD UPGRADE ASAP, AS USUAL. THERE WILL BE A FORKING CHANGE ON TESTNET THAT WILL ACTIVATE TO RE-ENABLE ZERO EMISSION PBAAS CHAIN CHALLENGES TOMORROW, AFTER 19:00 UTCThis release marks the completion and full resolution of the investigations that led to the PBaaS and DeFi pauses. As mentioned, all LP fees from exiting a DeFi basket\u2019s primary currency will now be properly burned into those currencies before conversion operations take place.Shortly before this announcement, all oracle notarizations that were suppressing DeFi, currency sub-ID registrations, and PBaaS chain launches were lifted from the network. That means all PBaaS functions are now live and fully operational!Please note: Though the last mandatory upgrade was v1.0.6, and this is not technically a mandatory upgrade, it does address the known and understood issue only affecting zero reward PBaaS chains that can create issues with cross-chain challenges.Until everyone is known to be on v1.0.7 or later, and we announce that such PBaaS configurations are well supported on the network, we recommend that no one launch a PBaaS chain that has zero block reward emissions. If you choose to do so anyhow, your chain should properly launch, but for about the next month, you may have issues with cross-chain function, unless you understand and plan appropriately. If launching a chain with zero emissions is important to you, and you seriously can\u2019t wait, please discuss with someone in development or support to understand your options. We don\u2019t believe that this is a critical early use case, so we actually don\u2019t expect it to be an issue for anyone.Our next step is the testnet rollout of the Ethereum bridge, and after a few days of that proving out in final testing and review, we will deploy it on mainnet as soon as we believe it is ready for permanent use. Once the Ethereum bridge is live on mainnet, if we do ever need a contract upgrade, we will announce and coordinate with network validators, as each Ethereum contract upgrade will be independently subject to Verus miner and staker approval.Thanks everyone for upgrading as soon as you are able!### Additional Verus Capabilities - On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs - On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming - On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
