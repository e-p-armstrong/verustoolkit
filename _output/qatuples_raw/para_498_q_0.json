    "What new feature is being launched as part of the Verus release, and what does it enable for currency definitions?",
    "The new Ethereum bridge is being launched, which enables full use of Ethereum mapped currencies on the Goerli Ethereum testnet. This makes it easy for any currency definition to become a fully decentralized, auditable stable coin by mapping to DAI, USDT, USDC, or another stable coin on Ethereum.",
    "As part of this release, we will be launching the new Ethereum bridge and enable full use of Ethereum mapped currencies on the Goerli Ethereum testnet (note that we were previously using Rinkeby). This makes it easy for any currency definition to become a fully decentralized, auditable stable coin, simply by mapping to DAI, USDT, USDC, or another stable coin on Ethereum. In addition, the new website for Metamask support and use from Ethereum now displays all mapped currency options, even those added when someone exports a currency definition to Ethereum, either as a mapped currency or for using any Verus or PBaaS currency as an ERC20.This release also resolves an issue with setting max preconversion amounts on currency launches and addresses a number of minor protocol issues found as a result of the active community testing support we are seeing on testnet.v0.9.3 RESETS TESTNET AND ADDRESSES ALL KNOWN ISSUES FOUND DURING TESTING ON THE NETWORK. FROM HERE, WE HOPE ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS WILL JOIN IN TRYING OUT ALL FEATURES OF TESTNET TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE FINAL MAINNET RELEASE, WHICH WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS AS SOON AS IT IS CONSIDERED READY AND HARDENED, WILL BE BOTH SMOOTH AND WORLD-CHANGING.IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED TESTNET WITH VERSIONS PRIOR TO v0.9.2, MAKE SURE TO DELETE AND CLEAR ANY EXISTING TESTNET DATA FOLDERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.## Platform Support - Debian 9 (Stretch) is no longer supported ## PROTOCOL RELEASE CANDIDATE RC1 With v0.9.3, The Verus PBaaS protocol, including networking, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi, is considered release candidate RC1 for the coming mainnet upgrade. The core developer focus now remains on protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets as well as merge mining for pool servers.## NEW PBAAS CAPABILITIES All PBaaS capabilities, including for application development, are available now on the new Verus testnet. Now would be a good time for development capable projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus\u2019s transformative technologies to do a deep dive on the Verus testnet. These new capabilities in v0.9.3, as well as all those we are familiar with, available nowhere else, will be on mainnet SOON(\u2122):",
