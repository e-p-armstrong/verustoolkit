    "What are the main components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus?",
    "A PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus consists of several components, including:\n\n1. `name`: The name of the PBaaS chain.\n2. `options`: An integer that specifies the options for the chain.\n3. `currencies`: An array of currencies that can be used on the chain.\n4. `conversions`: An array of conversion ratios between the chain's native currency and other currencies.\n5. `eras`: An array of objects that define the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each era in the chain's lifecycle.\n6. `notaries`: An array of VerusIDs that serve as notaries on the chain.\n7. `minnotariesconfirm`: The minimum number of notaries required to confirm a block.\n8. `nodes`: An array of objects that describe the network addresses and identities of the nodes on the chain.\n9. `gatewayconvertername`: The name of the gateway converter.\n10. `gatewayconverterissuance`: The initial issuance of the gateway converter's native token.",

(GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# Disclaimer",
