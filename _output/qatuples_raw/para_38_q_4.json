    "What are the connection options available in Verus, and what do they do?",
    "The connection options in Verus include:\n\n* `-addnode=<ip>`: Adds a node to connect to and attempts to keep the connection open.\n* `-banscore=<n>`: Sets the threshold for disconnecting misbehaving peers.\n* `-bantime=<n>`: Sets the number of seconds to keep misbehaving peers from reconnecting.\n* `-bind=<addr>`: Binds to a given address and always listens on it.\n* `-connect=<ip>`: Connects only to the specified node(s).\n* `-discover`: Discovers own IP addresses.\n* `-dns`: Allows DNS lookups for `-addnode`, `-seednode`, and `-connect`.\n* `-dnsseed`: Queries for peer addresses via DNS lookup, if low on addresses.\n* `-externalip=<ip>`: Specifies your own public address.\n* `-forcednsseed`: Always queries for peer addresses via DNS lookup.\n* `-listen`: Accepts connections from outside.\n* `-listenonion`: Automatically creates a Tor hidden service.",
    "`-prune=<n>`    Reduce storage requirements by pruning (deleting) old blocks. This mode    disables wallet support and is incompatible with `-txindex`.    **Warning** Reverting this setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain.    (default: 0 = disable pruning blocks, >550 = target size in MiB to use    for block files)`-reindex`    Rebuild block chain index from current blk000??.dat files on startup`-sysperms`    Create new files with system default permissions, instead of umask 077    (only effective with disabled wallet functionality)## Index options:`-addressindex`    Maintain a full address index, used to query for the balance, txids and    unspent outputs for addresses (default: 1)`-idindex`    Maintain a full identity index, enabling queries to select IDs with    addresses, revocation or recovery IDs (default: 0)    !!! Activating requires reindexing, not compatible with bootstrap!!!`-timestampindex`    Maintain a timestamp index for block hashes, used to query blocks hashes    by a range of timestamps (default: 0)    !!! Activating requires reindexing, not compatible with bootstrap!!!`-spentindex`    Maintain a full spent index, used to query the spending txid and input    index for an outpoint (default: 1)`-insightexplorer`    If enabled, forces addressindex, spentindex and timestampindex to enabled    If disabled, forces timestampindex to disabled    (default: 0)    !!! Activating requires reindexing, not compatible with bootstrap!!!## Connection options:`-addnode=<ip>`    Add a node to connect to and attempt to keep the connection open`-banscore=<n>`    Threshold for disconnecting misbehaving peers (default: 100)`-bantime=<n>`    Number of seconds to keep misbehaving peers from reconnecting (default:    86400)`-bind=<addr>`    Bind to given address and always listen on it. Use [host]:port notation    for IPv6`-connect=<ip>`    Connect only to the specified node(s)`-discover`    Discover own IP addresses (default: 1 when listening and no -externalip    or -proxy)`-dns`    Allow DNS lookups for -addnode, -seednode and -connect (default: 1)`-dnsseed`    Query for peer addresses via DNS lookup, if low on addresses (default: 1    unless -connect)`-externalip=<ip>`    Specify your own public address`-forcednsseed`    Always query for peer addresses via DNS lookup (default: 0)`-listen`    Accept connections from outside (default: 1 if no -proxy or -connect)`-listenonion`    Automatically create Tor hidden service (default: 1)",
