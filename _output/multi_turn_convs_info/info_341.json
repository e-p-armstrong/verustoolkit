            "What is Verus PBaaS, and what features does it offer?",
            "Verus PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) is a powerful and interoperable currency, blockchain, and ERC20 launch, scale, and MEV-resistant DeFi platform. It offers a range of features, including:\n\n* Provable or pseudonymous, identity-based currency, liquidity pool, NFT, and multi-blockchain, fully decentralized network.\n* On-chain 100% decentralized launches with fair launch and/or crowdfunding options, on-chain auto-refund option for missed targets, automatic Ethereum ERC20 contract deployment, auto-created, MEV-resistant, liquidity baskets, and even auto-bridged, merge mineable, fully independent rent-free PBaaS blockchain launches.\n* All DeFi AMM conversions are verified via mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol.\n* All currencies and identities are primitives at L1 and are validated and verified on UTXO transactions, which check all inputs and outputs just as single currency L1.\n\nThese features enable users to launch and manage their own decentralized applications and services on the Verus network.",
