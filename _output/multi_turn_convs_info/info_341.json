            "What should I do if my Verus wallet is stuck on a specific block number and no longer synchronizes properly?",
            "If your wallet is stuck, first check if your wallet's block height is significantly lower than the current block height on the Verus explorer (more than 10 blocks behind). If it is, follow the procedure outlined: close your wallet, add nodes to your `VRSC.conf` file, save and exit, remove the `peers.dat` file, and then restart your wallet. If the problem persists, refer to the Verus wiki for further troubleshooting.",
