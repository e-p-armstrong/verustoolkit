            "What is a Verus DeFi fractional basket currency, and how does it work?",
            "A Verus DeFi fractional basket currency is a type of currency that is backed by one or more asset currencies at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. This means that the liquidity pool backing the currency is composed of a combination of different assets, with each asset contributing a certain percentage to the pool.\n\nThe Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers.",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.
