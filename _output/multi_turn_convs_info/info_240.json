            "Why do some antivirus software flag Verus downloads as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?",
            "Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag Verus downloads as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because they detect that the software is related to cryptocurrency mining. This is a false positive, and it's a warning that you are installing mining software, which could potentially be used by a third party to exploit your computer.",
