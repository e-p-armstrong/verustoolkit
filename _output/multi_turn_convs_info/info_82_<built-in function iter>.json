            "What is the importance of updating to Verus v0.9.5 or later by November 19th, 2022?",
            "It is crucial to update to Verus v0.9.5 or later by November 19th, 2022, to reliably stay synchronized to the Verus mainnet. The Komodo notaries will be updated to season 6, with an activation height of 2291830, at approximately 11:00 PM UTC, Saturday, November 19th, 2022. Failing to update may cause synchronization issues.",
            "As with the last release, this release updates the Komodo notaries to season 6, with an activation height of 2291830, at approximately 11:00 PM UTC, Saturday, November 19th, 2022. YOU MUST BE UPDATED TO v0.9.5 OR LATER BY THEN TO RELIABLY STAY SYNCHRONIZED TO THE VERUS MAINNET. WHILE THERE MAY BE A MAINNET PBAAS UPGRADE BEFORE THAT DATE, WE RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT UPGRADED YET, THAT YOU DO SO NOW.Please make sure that if you do choose to wait for the possibility of a mainnet PBaaS upgrade before this activation that you do upgrade to the latest release before Saturday, November 19th.## What\u2019s New For mainnet, this release has no material changes over v0.9.5, but is still considered critical, as mainnet users should be upgraded to v0.9.5+ before block 2291830.For testnet, v0.9.5-1 fixes an issue discovered on testnet where duplicate ID exports blocked cross-chain processing temporarily and also introduces a protocol improvement designed to make the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol even more resistant than what we believe was already the leading algorithm to multi-block attempts at MEV. The protocol change makes the following adjustments:Conversions and cross-chain transfers still roll-up into exports that are collected from one or more blocks of transfer transactions, but to determine when a block is the last of the prior export or first in the next requires a random bit pulled from later blocks. The last miner or staker to complete a block of an export retroactively receives 10% of all fees from processing that export, including all conversions, once the rollup is processed as an import. This reward used to go to the miner or staker who processes the export, which is no longer the case. Import transactions can now include up to n/2 arbitrage transactions, where n is the number of reserves in a liquidity basket currency.These changes together serve to disincentivize any miner or staker from attempting to exclude a large set of transactions from a block and front run all of them, as they will have an even chance of having all of those excluded transactions put back in with their transaction, turning potential gain into potential loss. They would be better off saving their working capital to arbitrage imports by joining transactions, bringing them close to market, and earning money without risk of loss. In addition, if they do end up putting more value of transactions in a block that caps the export rollup, they will reliably earn meaningful rewards without risk of loss in that way as well.",
