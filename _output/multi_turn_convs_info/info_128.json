            "How does Verus compare to other blockchain platforms in terms of its features and capabilities?",
            "Verus has a distinct advantage over other blockchain platforms due to its geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform. This allows for the creation of use cases that are not possible on other platforms, making Verus a superior choice for building on.",
            "For those who actually understand the challenges actual users have in crypto today, this release represents a historic move forward in public cryptographic networks and credibly and actually neutral infrastructure for society-wide human and AI collaboration and learning. As a community, this version really does realize the vision laid out in the original Verus Vision Paper, and at the same time provides much more than was described there. We are a community of individuals, and it is only because that is what we are that we have all arrived here together. The rest of the world is stuck on their Munchausen\u2019s protocols, trying to figure out how to share the front-running and back-running spoils taken from users, but Verus activation gives them a better path forward.As always, we do not promise, we describe a vision and welcome contributors from everywhere. Now that we, as a community, have delivered on the original phases of the vision together, it is time for all of us to consider what we might want to build over this incredible, geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform. Our next efforts across the community should be to realize the promise of this network in the use cases we create, use cases that we will have an advantage creating on Verus over any other platform because it really is that much better.### Additional Verus Capabilities - On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs - On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming - On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary.

It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.",
