The core developer focus now is protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets as well as merge mining for pool servers.## NEW 3D CROSS-CHAIN LIQUIDITY NETWORK VISUALIZER (GUI FOR TESTNET) In v0.9.2 Verus Desktop, there is a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on chain and cross-chain, with the ability to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions. To access the visualizer, click on \u201cVisualize Network\u201d on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop.
