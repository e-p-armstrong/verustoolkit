            "The Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology allows Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash. This means that multiple chains can earn rewards and be powered simultaneously, providing increased flexibility and scalability to the Verus network.",

When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously.
