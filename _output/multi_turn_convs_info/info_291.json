            "What is Verus Vault, and what kind of protection does it offer?",
            "Verus Vault is a feature that provides a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery for VerusIDs, NFTs, and other assets. It offers protection against common forms of crypto loss or theft, and allows for the recovery of funds in case of an unauthorized access. Additionally, Verus Vault provides time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.
