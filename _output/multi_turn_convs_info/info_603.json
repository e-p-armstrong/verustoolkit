            "What are some limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus?",
            "There are two limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus:\n\n1. You cannot make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n2. In the GUI, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.",
