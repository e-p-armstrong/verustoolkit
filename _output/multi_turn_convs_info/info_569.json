            "To verify the integrity of a downloaded Verus package, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. The package has been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\".\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command in the Verus CLI to verify the signature.",
