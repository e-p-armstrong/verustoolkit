            "Verus coin launches offer several advanced features, including:\n\n1. Pre-conversions with network fees deducted\n2. Maximum participation in one or more currencies\n3. Pre-launch discounts\n4. Price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies\n5. Price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds\n6. Pre-launch discounts for early participants\n7. Vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs\n\nThese features provide a high degree of customization and flexibility for coin launches on the Verus network.",

The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. #### Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}' ``` - **Time Delay:**  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}' ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ### Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g. BTC ETH:** ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth ``` Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.#### Sending and Converting Currency **Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**The `sendcurrency` ",

            "The launch options in Verus provide a way to configure the launch of a new currency or token. They offer features such as maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs. Additionally, they allow for price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds and pre-launch discounts for early participants.",
            "und of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. #### Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}' ``` - **Time Delay:**  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}' ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ### Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g. BTC ETH:** ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth ``` Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.#### Sending and Converting Currency **Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**The `sendcurrency` ",
