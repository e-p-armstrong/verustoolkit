            "What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does it work?",
            "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. It allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, without the need for intermediaries, and can be paid for or offered from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses.",

If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.",
