            "What is Verus ID, and what are its key features?",
            "Verus ID is a decentralized identity technology that provides a secure, quantum-ready, fully decentralized, and self-sovereign digital identity system. It includes built-in privacy through the integration of zk-SNARKs and offers several benefits, such as:\n\n* Recovery of lost funds after losing keys\n* Security against identity and key theft\n* Ability to prove certain information without revealing more than necessary\n* Transfer of assets to heirs as part of an estate",
            " improvement to the FPGA-equalizing hash algorithm, and a revolutionary, new decentralized identity technology, Verus IDs, that will disrupt today\u2019s centralized systems with the most secure, quantum ready, fully decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity system in the world. ## Verus ID Verus ID includes built-in privacy at the core through integration of zk-SNARKs, and provides a revolutionary improvement to blockchain address security, making it possible to actually recover your money after losing your keys, secure against identity and key theft, prove things about yourself without having to show more details than needed, and transfer assets to heirs as part of your estate. This release also introduces a new smart transaction technology that is unique to the Verus network and replaces its use of Komodo compatible crypto-conditions. The Verus ID system was made possible through the use of Verus Smart Transactions, which will be available for everyone to use on their own blockchains in the upcoming PBaaS network upgrade. Verus Smart Transactions use standard Bitcoin style serialization rather than the ASN.1 used in crypto conditions, which makes support on lite or mobile wallets simpler to implement than the crypto-condition protocol, which is still used on the Verus network for Stake Guard. ## VerusHash 2.1 VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# Verus ID - A Better Blockchain Identity Technology If you\u2019ve been around crypto for even a little while, you\u2019ll start to hear things like \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d, \u201close your keys, lose your coins\u201d. If you lose your keys, no one will ever be able to recover your money.",
