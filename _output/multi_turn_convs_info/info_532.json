            "If your antivirus software flags the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", it's because the software is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning. You can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives.",
