            "What are some common false positives that antivirus software may flag when downloading Verus software?",
            "Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). These warnings are generated because Verus software is capable of mining cryptocurrencies, and some antivirus programs may incorrectly identify it as malicious.",
