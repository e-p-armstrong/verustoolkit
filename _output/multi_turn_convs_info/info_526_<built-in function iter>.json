            "When registering an identity using the `registeridentity` command in Verus, there are several optional parameters that can be specified:\n\n1. `privateaddress`: a shielded address associated with the VerusID being made.\n2. `revocationauthority`: an ID that will be able to disable the created ID in case of loss or theft.\n3. `recoveryauthority`: an ID that will be able to revive the created ID if it is revoked.\n4. `returntx`: a boolean parameter that, if set to `true`, returns a transaction for additional signatures rather than committing it. The default value is `false`.\n5. `feeoffer`: the amount to offer the miner/staker for the registration fee. If missing, the standard price is used.\n6. `sourceoffunds`: an optional address to use for the source of funds. If not specified, the transparent wildcard `\"*\"` is used.",
