            "What does it mean when `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new token?",
            "When `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new token, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID, which means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.",
            "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level. First, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' ``` of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches. After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]' ``` that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
