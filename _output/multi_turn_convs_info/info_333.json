So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address, so it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`.## Procedure 1. Open your `VRSC.conf` file for editing. 2. Add a line to `VRSC.conf` containing  (mac or linux)  `exportdir=/home/<username>/`  (or on windows)  `exportdir=c:\\Users<username>\\Desktop\\` 3.

To make the backup just copy it to another directory, make sure to leave the original there for the time being. 5. Now restart your wallet by launching Verus Desktop, Agama or running verusd for the CLI. 6.
