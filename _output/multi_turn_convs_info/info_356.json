            "What is Verus Vault, and how does it protect funds on a VerusID?",
            "Verus Vault is a feature that allows you to protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key. When you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. To use Verus Vault, you need to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock.",
