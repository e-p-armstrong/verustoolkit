            "The update is considered CRITICAL, but not mandatory. This is because the issue fixed by this update does not expose any funds to theft or counterfeit, but rather fixes a vulnerability that an attacker may exploit to probe for information regarding a specific node's control over private keys.",
            "In addition, this version also includes updates to Sapling functionality, including the Sprout to Sapling migration APIs added to the Zcash protocol up to and including version 2.0.7-3 of Zcash. The issue fixed by this update does not expose any funds to theft or counterfeit, but it does fix a vulnerability that an attacker may exploit to probe for information regarding a specific node's control over private keys. Since the issue resolved does not put funds directly at risk, this update is considered CRITICAL, not mandatory. We recommended that all users upgrade to this version of the Verus CLI or GUI wallet immediately and discontinue use of previous wallets.# Notable Changes - Integrated Zcash updates from Sapling release to 2.0.7-3 - Added Sprout to Sapling upgrade API - Including support for PBaaS multi-chain test network with permissionless blockchain launches, reserve currency conversion protocols, merge mining, and easy cross-chain transactions.# Testnet Reset The testnet will be deleted and relaunched for this release. **IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY LAUNCHED VRSCTEST, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:** **Linux:** ``` ~/.komodo/VRSCTEST ~/.verustest ```**MacOS** ``` \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest```**Windows** ``` %APPDATA%\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST %APPDATA%\\VerusTest ```# Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and Verus Reserve cross-chain currency conversion technology -- Technology PreviewThe Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume.
