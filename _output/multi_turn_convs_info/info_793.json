            "The Verus testnet has several unique capabilities, including:\n\n* Self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities\n* Ability to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.\n\nThese capabilities are not found in other cryptocurrency platforms, making Verus a pioneering platform in the crypto space.",
