            "What was the issue with the cross-chain VRSC currency launch that led to the notification oracle technology being triggered?",
            "The issue was that a numeric function used in cross-chain challenges was calculated incorrectly for mainnet due to the original launch including deprecated time-locked rewards. This would have caused cross-chain challenges on mainnet to fail and block a bridge until the calculation was corrected and the network was upgraded.",
            "While preparing the cross-chain VRSC currency launch and as part of continual review, we determined that one numeric function that is used in the cross-chain challenges and is calculated differently for mainnet, due to the original launch that included the deprecated time locked rewards, was incorrect. This had never been hit, as it would have been calculated incorrectly only if multiple chains experienced a challenge of two competing forks, but in that case, it would falsely reject any challenge proof. That would mean cross-chain challenges on mainnet, even though they were fine and fully tested on testnet, could fail and block a bridge until that calculation was made correct and the network upgraded.Because we have the notification oracle technology, we triggered a rip-cord notification selectively for cross-chain that made all nodes listening to the oracle, which we expect to be near 100%, disallow cross-chain operations without affecting same chain operations. That means that all functions on the Verus network, except launching PBaaS chains or Ethereum bridges are fully functional and unhampered in any way at this time. If someone tries to launch a PBaaS chain while this oracle notification is active, all nodes following the oracle will reject such an action without incident until the notification is removed.This release, v1.0.5, properly calculates the aptly named \u201cmagic number\u201d for each chain, in the correct way on the mainnet network, and as long as the notification is set, is fully compatible with current versions on the network.Once everyone has had a chance to upgrade to v1.0.5, the network/community should agree to remove the notification from the oracle and allow PBaaS launches without false rejection of cross-chain challenges. Once we do that, and when someone launches a PBaaS chain that issues such a challenge, the network would become incompatible with Verus versions prior to 1.0.5.From our perspective, we are not aware of urgent efforts to launch a PBaaS chain in the next few days by anyone who cannot wait. All things considered, we believe that we can at least wait until the community discussion on Saturday, and that a strawman deadline would be **Monday, May 29th, at 19:00 UTC** for everyone to have upgraded. If you are urgently wanting to launch a PBaaS chain, have a plan, and are prepared to do so sooner, we invite you to join the community meeting on Saturday at 19:00 UTC and let everyone know.",
