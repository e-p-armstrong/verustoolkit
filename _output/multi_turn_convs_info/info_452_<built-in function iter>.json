            "VerusIDs offer the benefits of being quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses, allowing users to receive and send funds with control over the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. Additionally, VerusIDs are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms, and will soon be able to be made retroactively quantum resistant with the integration of a quantum secure signature scheme.",

            "VerusIDs are quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses because they are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum-resistant signatures for transactions, the VerusIDs themselves are quantum-ready. A quantum-secure signature scheme is being integrated, which will make it possible to change an ID and have all funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.",
            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.
