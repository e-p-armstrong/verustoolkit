Each blockchain is independent and connected through the Verus Reserve protocol. # Notable Changes - Added command `refundfailedlaunch` to refund all contributions made to PBaaS chain to VRSCTEST after a failed chain start block.- Fixed wallet scan issue that could prevent a wallet from recognizing reserve coins sent to it on a PBaaS chain.
