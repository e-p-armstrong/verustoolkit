            "On Verus, blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches allow for the creation of new blockchains with minimum participation requirements. If the minimum participation levels are not met by the launch time, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations, and vesting schedules.",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees.

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.

There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.
