All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.The initial price in reserve at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the early blocks that will come in as reserve currency. All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve. A currency with a reserve of 0.1 or 10% will rise or fall fairly quickly when converted to or from, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit.**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:** ``` ./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN ``` On first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect.
