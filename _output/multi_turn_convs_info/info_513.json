            "What are the limitations of creating a multi-currency PBaaS chain?",
            "There are two limitations to be aware of when creating a multi-currency PBaaS chain:\n\n1. You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n2. In the GUI, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for the testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.",

Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies.

            "A PBaaS blockchain definition consists of several components, including:\n\n1. `name`: The name of the PBaaS chain.\n2. `options`: An integer that defines various properties of the chain.\n3. `currencies`: An array of currencies that can be converted to the chain's native currency.\n4. `conversions`: An array of conversion ratios between the chain's native currency and each currency on the chain.\n5. `eras`: An array of objects defining the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each era in the chain's lifecycle.\n6. `notaries`: An array of VerusIDs that serve as notaries on the chain.\n7. `minnotariesconfirm`: An integer that specifies the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block.\n8. `nodes`: An array of objects describing the network addresses and IDs of the nodes on the chain.\n9. `gatewayconvertername`: The name of the bridge converter.\n10. `gatewayconverterissuance`: The initial issuance of the bridge converter's native token.",
