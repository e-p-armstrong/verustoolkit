            "How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download using the command line?",
            "You can verify the authenticity of a Verus download using the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands with the Verus CLI. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Extract the text file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature.\n3. Use the `verifyfile` command with the signer's identity (\"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\") and the path to the extracted archive file.\n\nExample: `./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" /path/to/extracted/archive.tar.gz`\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `verifyhash` command with the signer's identity and the sha256 file checksum.\n\nExample: `./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" 444d2c231e9d76bcff47c0f3da6822aab7c39567a2c313642675a35fcd484f7f`\n\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.",
