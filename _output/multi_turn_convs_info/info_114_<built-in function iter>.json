            "If you end up on your own fork because of a network issue or having an old version of the wallet, you can solve the problem in two ways: either by installing the latest bootstrap file (less work, big download) or by searching manually for the forked block and invalidating that block (time-consuming, no download needed).",
            "# Question: What should I do if I end up on my own fork because of a network issue or having an old version of the wallet?This solution can be solved in 2 ways: you can simply install the latest bootstrap file (less work, big download) or search manually for the forked block and invalidate that block (time-consuming, no download needed.)## Procedure 1 (Easy, installing bootstrap)For all GUI or CLI users. 1. Stop the wallet/mining process by cleanly shutting down the program. 2. Update your wallet if necessary. 3. Follow the procedure in [HOW-TO Backup, Install or Update and Bootstrap your wallet.md](#!how-to/how-to_bootstrap.md) to efficiently rectify the problem. 4. Do not be dismayed if it seems that your mining rewards suddenly seem to come to a halt. Remember, when you mine to the wrong chain rewards can come in very quickly, but they are worth nothing.## Procedure 2 (Time consuming, no extra download)### Verus-Desktop 1. The commands are **all** entered in the *Native Client Terminal* that is located under `Settings`, `Coin Settings`. 2. Search for the **earliest** block that not matches the blockchain:   `run getblockhash <suspected blocknumber>` will show you the blockhash for the blocknumber you filled in   The response shown in the *Native Client Terminal* will be similar to this:   `5cc7844973fb95ef17f1772ea4aba579f0d8273fb0ee6064cd8e707d1056c646` 3. Check the blockhash your command gave you against the blockhash the [explorer](https://explorer.verus.io) shows. 4. If the blockhash from the explorer is different than yours, repeat steps 2 & 3 until you find the earliest block that is different. 5. Use the **earliest incorrect blockhash** from your system to invalidate that block:   `run invalidateblock <earliest incorrect blockhash>`   The *Native Client Terminal* will not give feedback on this command. 6. Now use the **correct blockhash** that the explorer gave you for the block you just locally invalidated:   `run reconsiderblock <correct blockhash>`   Again the *Native Client Terminal* will not give feedback on this command. 7. Once your wallet connects to a node that is on the correct chain, it will quicly synchronize.   If needed you can either restart your wallet to force new connections or manually disconnect bad nodes.",
