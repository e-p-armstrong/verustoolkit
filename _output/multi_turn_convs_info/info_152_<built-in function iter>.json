            "Version v0.7.1-4 of the Verus protocol has several key features and enhancements, including:\n\n1. Increased scale over previous versions.\n2. The ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency.\n3. Price-neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies.\n4. A new \"burn\" parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API, which allows for the official removal of a currency from its supply, increasing the on-chain price for all holders.",
            "# Enhancements to TestNet Protocols for Increased Scale, Currency Burn Functions, and Centralized Fractional Currencies Version v0.7.1-4 is not yet considered hardened for mainnet, but has increased scale over previous versions in addition to the ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency. This allows price neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. This version also enables a new parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API called \"burn\". If \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent, which must be a token or fractional currency is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.# An end to front running Conversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.# The Best Way to Launch a Currency Currency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!",

            "How does the conversion process work in Verus, and what fees are associated with it?",
            "In Verus, conversions are processed in groups of transactions, and all transactions in a group are solved simultaneously in all currency conversion directions. This means that all conversions are done at the same rate, with no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. There is a fee of 0.025% for conversions, which goes to miners and stakers. Additionally, an implied volatility fee is planned to be implemented, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers' risk with earnings from implied volatility fees.",
