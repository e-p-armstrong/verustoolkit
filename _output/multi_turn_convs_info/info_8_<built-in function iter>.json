            "How do I reset my testnet after the latest testnet reset?",
            "To reset your testnet, make sure Verus is closed and no testnet daemon is running. Then, delete the following directories:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`\n* On Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`\n* On Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\VRSC\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`\n\nAfter deleting these directories, restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native).",
            "1. Testnet reset with fixes for all reported PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID user issues. If you had reported issues, please verify that the issues you reported are addressed in this release. 2. Support for the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge, which has been testing on private networks and which we hope to launch within a day or two after first vetting it on the release testing network with community test volunteers. 3. Support for the new `getvdxfid` RPC call, used along with your ID and published names to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys, which community members used to create the world\u2019s first self-sovereign, completely decentralized, rent-free, non-cancelable social media profiles as can be seen here: https://luckpool.net/profile/identity/mike.vrsc . Work is underway to document the VDXF keys defined and used for profiles as well as the process of setting up your own. While the capability is already extremely powerful, we should remind everyone that Verus is a platform, not a social network. The core technology is exciting, but what will be even more exciting is when businesses and entrepreneurs leverage it to enable new, self-sovereign user experiences, applications, and accompanying businesses to enable the future, truly decentralized web. 4. Fix for the Electron certificate issue in the GUI wallet, which has been affecting prices and preventing BTC fee calculation. 5. Support for some additional, popular ERC20 currencies, in anticipation of more usage after release of the ETH bridge. 6. Fix in GUI for calculated balances of specific addresses sometimes showing lower than actual, even though wallet balance displayed correctly. 7. Additional hardening, fixes and improvement focused on mainnet and the Ethereum bridge.To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest` - Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest` - Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain  ```  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'  ```",
