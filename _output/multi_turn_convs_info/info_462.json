            "Tokenized ID control is a feature that allows an ID to be treated like a super NFT over all copies of the source ID on all chains that were exported to other chains after the currency was created. This enables NFTs to be upleveled with ID powers, being cryptographically bound as an ID's permanent control token that can be sent to any chain or to Ethereum and back.",
