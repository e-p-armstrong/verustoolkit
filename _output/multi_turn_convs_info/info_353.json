            "To engage in pool mining on a Raspberry Pi-like device, you need:\n\n1. A 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled.\n2. A 64-bit operating system (Raspbian is standard 32-bit, so you'll need an alternative).\n3. An ARM release of a mining software like CCMiner or NHEQminer.\n4. Low latency internet connectivity.\n5. A public address to mine to.\n6. A public mining pool to connect to.",
