            "What is a bridge converter liquidity pool in Verus, and how does it work?",
            "A bridge converter liquidity pool in Verus is a decentralized or centralized pool that enables the conversion of assets between different blockchains. It is defined as part of creating a new blockchain and runs on that blockchain. The fees generated from cross-chain conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no fees going back to the Verus blockchain. This provides seamless connectivity between blockchains.",

There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. ## Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**   The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'   ``` - **Time Delay:**   The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the fla",
