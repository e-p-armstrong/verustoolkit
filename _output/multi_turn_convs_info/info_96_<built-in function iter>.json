            "You can send unconverted VRSCTEST to an address on another chain for later conversion to/from the native coin using the following command: `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000}'`.",
            "The initial price in reserve at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the early blocks that will come in as reserve currency. All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve. A currency with a reserve of 0.1 or 10% will rise or fall fairly quickly when converted to or from, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit.**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:** ``` ./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN ``` On first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.## Here are a few examples of cross-chain operations using the command line:**Participating in a blockchain launch and converting from reserve before the chain has started (refund address is optional and will default to paymentaddress):** ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"preconvert\": 1}' ```**Sending unconverted VRSCTEST to an address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain for later conversion to/from the native coin.** ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000}' ```**Sending reserve to another chain and converting a coin from reserve to that chain's native currency at the current market price.** ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}' ```",
