            "What was the outcome of the recent public network upgrade and testing, which aimed to harden the mainnet release?",
            "The outcome of the recent upgrade and testing on the public network was a significant learning experience, which led to the hardening of the mainnet release. Although it may have caused a delay, the learning and consequent hardening will ensure a more secure mainnet release.",
            "Thanks for all your testing! We\u2019ve learned a great deal from this upgrade, and although it may feel like a delay that we took the time to learn and address it in place on the public network before moving on, this learning and consequent hardening will ensure the mainnet release will be more hardened than ever. Next steps are to upgrade auto notarization to be resilient to anything like this level of buildup over weeks automatically and prepare the mainnet release.
