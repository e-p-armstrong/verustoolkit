            "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain. It allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. The platform enables transactions to be executed in a completely decentralized way, without the need for intermediaries. Users can pay or offer to pay from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, and accept payment to either, while still maintaining the ability to audit transactions.",

            "How does Verus Vault protect against unauthorized access to locked funds, and what is the concept of a \"5 dollar wrench attack\"?",
            "Verus Vault protects against unauthorized access to locked funds by allowing users to set a predetermined unlock time, which can be used in conjunction with a revocation/recovery ID to revoke and recover the funds in case of an unauthorized unlock. This provides a decentralized solution to the \"5 dollar wrench attack\", where an attacker uses physical force or coercion to gain access to a user's private keys. With Verus Vault, even if an attacker gains access to the private keys, they will still need to wait for the unlock time to expire before they can spend or access the funds.",

            "What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does it work?",
            "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. It allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the blockchain for everyone to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, with the option to use transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses. This means that users can pay or offer to pay from a private address, while still being able to audit the transaction.",

Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.### Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",

            "Verus Vault is a feature that allows users to protect funds on a VerusID, even if their private key is stolen. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the user cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. While locked, the user can still stake their funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. Funds can still be received, but they cannot be spent. The lock can be revoked and recovered by the revocation and recovery authority identities, which provides an additional layer of security.",

            "How does Verus Vault prevent unauthorized access to funds, and what is the \"5 dollar wrench attack\"?",
            "Verus Vault prevents unauthorized access to funds by allowing users to set a delay between unlocking their VerusID and being able to spend funds. This delay can be set to a predetermined time, such as 24 hours. During this time, the revocation and recovery authority identities can detect any unauthorized unlock attempts and revoke the unlock. This provides protection against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\", where an attacker uses physical force or coercion to gain access to a user's private keys.",
