            "When installing Verus software, you may see warnings from antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky, flagging the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). These warnings are triggered because Verus software includes mining capabilities, which could be exploited by third parties to use your PC for their own gain. However, these warnings are false positives, and you can learn more about them by reviewing resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky.",
