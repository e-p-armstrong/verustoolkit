            "How can currency launches on Verus raise funds, and what is the effect on the currency's price?",
            "Currency launches on Verus can raise funds in three ways: pre-launch discount, pre-launch carve-out, and pre-allocation. These fundraising options create a currency that is not 100% backed and has a price that responds to market forces. The price of the currency will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it.",
            "i-currency capable networks (currently other independent PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s). - Currencies on Verus can also be defined as \"mapped currencies\", which map 1:1 to an existing currency on Ethereum (eg. DAI), and can then be sent from Ethereum with simple transactions and received and used as the new \"mapped currency\", or sent back to Ethereum and used there as the original currency. - Currency launches can raise funds in 3 ways. Each of these fundraising options creates a currency that is not 100% backed, and has a price that responds to market forces. 100% backed currencies do not change their relative price to the underlying basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, whether time-locked or not, take their funding from a percentage of the reserve backing. Except in the case of a new blockchain launch, which creates new native currency for operating the proof of stake of the blockchain, any currency that uses fundraising options will be a fractionally backed currency which will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it. If a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options that are not met, no fundraising is received:  - Pre-launch discount - all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency. This is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live. - Pre-launch carve-out - this enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch. - Pre-allocation - this enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods.## Testnet Reset To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):",
