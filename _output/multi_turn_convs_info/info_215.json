            "What is Verus, and how does it differ from a traditional blockchain?",
            "Verus is more than just a single blockchain; it's an entire ecosystem of interconnected blockchains that operate decentralized and at the protocol level. Verus introduces Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service), a true publicly notarized blockchain as a service with an easy-to-use built-in wallet UI. This allows anyone to create their own full-fledged cryptocurrency, as long as it can be funded or supported by miners.",
            "Put simply, Verus is much more than any single ordinary blockchain; more of an entire ecosystem of **interconnected blockchains that all operate decentralized and at the protocol level**. Verus introduces Verus PBaaS (__**Public Blockchains as a Service**__), a true publicly notarized blockchain as a service with an easy to use built in wallet UI, designed to make it so that now anyone can start their very own full-fledged cryptocurrency so long as it can be funded or supported by miners. Newly created chains are just as secure as Verus itself and have the ability to be merge mined (up to __22x__ at once\\!)Benefiting both the user and the miners, self-strengthening the ecosystem and ensuring minimal fees (no room for middlemen to take a cut). Reserve backed currencies are also possible with __fractional reserve__ capabilities and since interoperability is paramount, exchanging currencies in __cross-chain transactions__ is as simple as sending coins from one wallet to a different coin\u2019s wallet. __Conversions__ are handled by a built in market maker that automatically determines price based on a predetermined curve and issues orders fairly to all buy/sells within a block, with zero spread and the added benefit of eliminating the well- established problem of front-running, just some amount of slippage based on the net buy/sell.. With reserve currencies, buyers can make buys without even needing sellers (and vice versa). Amazingly, everything is done at the __protocol level__ on a decentralized network, meaning Verus and it's associated chains can't be censored or stopped.## Getting started: ### Important links:Website: [*https://verus.io*](https://verus.io) Wallet: [*https://verus.io/wallet*](https://verus.io/wallet) GitHub: [*https://github.com/veruscoin*](https://github.com/veruscoin) Explorer: [*https://explorer.verus.io*](https://explorer.verus.io) Discord: [*https://verus.io/discord*](https://verus.io/discord) Check [https://youtu.be/YVOfIMjRf30](Human Verification) if you only see one empty channel.
