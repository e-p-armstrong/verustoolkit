            "There are two limitations to be aware of:\n\n1. You should not create an ID with an i-address as its name, as this can cause problems when using i-addresses or names. This is not prevented by the protocol, but it will cause issues and is not supported for creating currencies.\n2. (GUI only) If a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.",
