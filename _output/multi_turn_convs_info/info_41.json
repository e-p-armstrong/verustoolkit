With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities On the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",

            "What is Verus Vault technology, and how does it enhance VerusIDs?",
            "Verus Vault technology is an advanced time lock capability that extends the features of VerusIDs, which are already revocable, recoverable, and provable. This technology enables the implementation of various use cases such as vesting, trusts, and theft-proofing funds, while also simplifying estate planning. With Verus Vault, users can manage their identities, funds, and estate planning in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the assurance of protection from lost or stolen private keys.",

            "Verus Fee Pooling technology addresses the concerns raised by Vitalik Buterin regarding the sustainability of mining and staking fee and revenue models in cryptocurrencies like ETH and ETH 2.0. This technology preserves the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time. In the fee pooling model, all fees from transactions in a block are gathered and added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees. The current block miner or staker then takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.",
