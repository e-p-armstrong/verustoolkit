            "What is Verus Fee Pooling technology, and how does it address concerns about blockchain security and fee distribution?",
            "Verus Fee Pooling technology is a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model that strengthens blockchain security while preserving an immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees. It works by gathering all fees from transactions in a block, adding them to a common pool, and allowing the current block miner or staker to take up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool. This model addresses legitimate concerns about fee distribution and blockchain security, such as those expressed by Vitalik Buterin regarding ETH and ETH 2.0.",

In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities On the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
