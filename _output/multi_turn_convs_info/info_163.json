            "A VerusID is a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides a decentralized identity system. It is not controlled by a corporation and offers various benefits such as quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses, full decentralization, and opportunities for identity applications.",

If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys.

When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.* Recoverable -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.",
