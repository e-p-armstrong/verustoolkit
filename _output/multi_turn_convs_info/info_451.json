            "How can I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the testnet and mainnet?",
            "To sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency`.\n2. Get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency` and use it with `verus z_getoperationstatus` to get the raw hex transaction data.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using `verus signrawtransaction`.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.",
