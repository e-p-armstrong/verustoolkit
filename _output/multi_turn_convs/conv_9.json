    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm happy to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the testnet release, and I was wondering about a limitation I've encountered. What is a limitation of the current testnet release regarding PBaaS chain names?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the current testnet release, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop (such as BTC or ETH), you will not be able to use those same names for a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata and will be resolved before mainnet availability. We're working on ironing out these kinds of issues before the mainnet launch.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering, what kind of warranty or liability does the software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! The software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. We're open-source, so it's important to understand that you're using the software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nI've also had some issues with my antivirus software flagging the Verus software. Why might some antivirus software flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it includes mining software, which could potentially be used by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can find more information about it by reviewing the resources provided. We're working on getting whitelisted by these antivirus software providers to prevent these kinds of false alarms.",
