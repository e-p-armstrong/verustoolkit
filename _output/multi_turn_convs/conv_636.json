    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been looking into the flags you can set on a Verus chain. Can you tell me about the OPTION_PBAAS flag?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_PBAAS flag, set to 256, indicates that the chain is a PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) chain definition. Do you have any other questions about Verus chain flags?\n\n**User:**\nI was also looking at OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER. What does that flag do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER flag is set on a Verus chain, it means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices. Do you have any more questions about Verus chain flags?\n\n**User:**\nWhat about OPTION_ID_STAKING? What does that flag do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_ID_STAKING flag, set to 4, indicates that all IDs on the chain stake equally, rather than using value-based staking. Do you have any more questions about Verus chain flags?\n\n**User:**\nI saw OPTION_ID_REFERRALS in the list of flags. What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the OPTION_ID_REFERRALS flag is set on a Verus chain, it means that the chain supports referrals. Do you have any more questions about Verus chain flags?\n\n**User:**\nI noticed there's also an OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED flag. What's the difference between those two?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOPTION_ID_REFERRALS (set to 8) indicates that a Verus chain supports referrals, while OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED (set to 16) means that the chain requires referrals. Do you have any more questions about Verus chain flags?\n\n**User:**\nWhat does the OPTION_TOKEN flag indicate when set on a Verus chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the OPTION_TOKEN flag is set on a Verus chain, it indicates that the chain is a token, rather than a native currency. Do you have any more questions about Verus chain flags?\n\n**User:**\nWhat about OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY? What does that flag do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY flag, set to 64, is used for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to a single currency. Do you have any more questions about Verus chain flags?\n\n**User:**\nI saw OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER in the list of flags. What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER flag, set to 1024, determines whether top-level ID and currency registration happen on the launch chain or not. When not set on a gateway, top-level ID and currency registration happen on the launch chain. Do you have any more questions about Verus chain flags?\n\n**User:**\nWhat about OPTION_NFT_TOKEN? What does that flag do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_NFT_TOKEN flag, set to 2048, indicates that the token is a single satoshi NFT token, which tokenizes control over the root ID. Do you have any more questions about Verus chain flags?\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I was curious about the OPTION_GATEWAY flag. What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the OPTION_GATEWAY flag is set on a Verus chain, it means that the chain routes external currencies. I'm glad I could help clarify all these flags for you! Do you have any more questions about Verus or its chain flags?",
