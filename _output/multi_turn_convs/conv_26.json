    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any issues you might be experiencing with Verus. What seems to be the problem today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to move some coinbase coins, but I keep getting the error \"Your wallet.dat is not matching the blockchain\". Do you know what might be causing this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, I can help you with that. This error can occur when trying to move coinbase coins directly, without shielding them through a private address (zaddress) first, which is a requirement of the Verus blockchain rules.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, I didn't shield them first. How can I resolve this error and move my coinbase coins?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo resolve this error, you need to shield your coinbase coins through a private address (zaddress) first. Here's a step-by-step procedure:\n\nYou can start by going to the \"Receive\" screen and creating a new private address (starting with `zs`) if you don't already have one. Then, copy the new private address to your clipboard.\n\nNext, go to the \"Mining\" screen, select Verus, and select \"Shield Rewards\". Leave \"All unshielded funds\" as the source and paste the new zaddress into the destination.\n\nClick on \"Continue\" and wait until you have a private balance showing on the Wallet screen. Finally, send the coins again, this time from your private address to any normal transparent receive address that you have.\n\nIf you follow these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and move your coinbase coins successfully. Do you have any questions about these steps or need further clarification?",
