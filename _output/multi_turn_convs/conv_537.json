    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `setminingdistribution` command, but I'm not sure how to set multiple mining outputs. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `setminingdistribution` command by providing a JSON object with destination addresses and their corresponding relative values. For example:\n```\nverus setminingdistribution {\"myaddress\":0.5, \"otheraddress\":0.5}\n```\nThis command sets the mining distribution to split rewards 50/50 between \"myaddress\" and \"otheraddress\". Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about using `setminingdistribution`?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. What happens when I submit a block using the `submitblock` command? What are the possible results?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe possible results of submitting a block using the `submitblock` command are:\n* \"duplicate\" - node already has a valid copy of the block\n* \"duplicate-invalid\" - node already has the block, but it is invalid\n* \"duplicate-inconclusive\" - node already has the block, but has not validated it\n* \"inconclusive\" - node has not validated the block, it may not be on the node's current best chain\n* \"rejected\" - block was rejected as invalid\n\nThese results indicate whether the block was accepted, rejected, or if there's an issue with validation. Do you have any more questions about submitting blocks?\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing. What's the purpose of the `setminingdistribution` command in Verus, anyway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `setminingdistribution` command sets multiple mining outputs with amounts that will be used to calculate relative outputs to each address for any reward. It allows you to specify a JSON object with destination addresses and their corresponding relative values, which will be used to distribute mining rewards. This way, you can customize how your mining rewards are distributed among different addresses. Does that make sense?",
