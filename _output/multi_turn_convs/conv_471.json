    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been looking into the Verus software and I was wondering, what are the links to VirusTotal for the Verus software on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe links to VirusTotal for the Verus software are:\n- MacOS: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/8a7f7bf3df09fa352979b1b92b3eea99fc802bce41f4349cfdeb3f25792233ce/detection\n- Linux-AMD64: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/de2961c3d4c0a00ce565989721d25b3abcf1e9e70b511c5cdb4e343005b13cc4/detection\n- Windows: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/74bbe68954498821f079a9a611cf6b8b8f8deb10f9a6e2feb594deba5c5ed7b1/detection\n\nThese links will give you an idea of the software's safety and legitimacy.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks! I've also been seeing some warnings from my antivirus software. Why may Avast and Kaspersky flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAvast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it includes mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. These warnings are false positives. The Verus software is safe and legitimate, and you don't need to worry about these warnings.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that there's an upcoming deadline for upgrading to the new Verus software. What's the importance of upgrading to the new Verus software by December 15th?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUpgrading to the new Verus software by December 15th is mandatory to remain on the Verus mainnet. The Verus mainnet protocol will hardfork at block 800200, and failing to upgrade may require resynchronizing the blockchain if you are running in native mode. Make sure to upgrade before the deadline to avoid any issues!",
