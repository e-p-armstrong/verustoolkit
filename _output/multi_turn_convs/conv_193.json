    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out when an immature block will mature. Do you know how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo determine when an immature block will mature, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Get the current block height (\"blocks\") and the \"blockstomaturity\" value, which is the distance to maturity of the transaction in question.\n2. Apply the formula: `blockstomaturity / 1440 = days to maturity (unlocking)`.\n\nFor example, if `blockstomaturity` is 925558, the calculation would be `925558 / 1440 = 643 days`. This means the block will mature in 643 days.\n\nDo you have any further questions about determining when an immature block will mature?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I'm not entirely sure what the `blockstomaturity` value represents. Can you explain that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `blockstomaturity` value represents the distance to maturity of the transaction in question, which is the number of blocks between the current block height and where it unlocks. This value decreases over time, and adding it to the current block height will reveal a constant value.\n\nSo, `blockstomaturity` is essentially a countdown to when the block will mature and unlock. Does that make sense?",

You can see the number is decreasing all the time, and if you add it to the current block height you'll see a constant.) 2.
