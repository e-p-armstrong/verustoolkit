    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you with any Verus-related questions. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand where my Verus wallet and data are stored. Can you tell me where they're located on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus wallet and data are stored in the following locations on different operating systems:\n\n* Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC`\n* Mac OS: `/Users//Library/Application Support/komodo/VRSC`\n* Windows: `%AppData%\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`\n\nSo, depending on the operating system you're using, you can find your Verus wallet and data in one of these locations. Do you have any other questions about Verus or its storage?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question, actually. I'm running a Verus Enhanced Agama installation, and I'm trying to find the CLI binaries. Where are they located?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn a Verus Enhanced Agama installation, the CLI binaries are located in the following locations:\n\n* Windows:\n\t+ Verus binaries: `resources\\app\\assets\\bin\\win64\\verusd\\` (contains `verusd` and `verus`)\n\t+ Komodo (and asset chains) binaries: `resources\\app\\assets\\bin\\win64\\` (contains `komodod` and `komodo-cli`)\n* Linux:\n\t+ Verus binaries: `resources\\app\\assets\\bin\\linux64\\verusd` (contains `verusd` and `verus`)\n\t+ Komodo (and asset chains) binaries: `resources\\app\\assets\\bin\\linux64\\` (contains `komodod` and `komodo-cli`)\n\nSo, depending on your operating system, you should be able to find the CLI binaries in one of these locations. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
