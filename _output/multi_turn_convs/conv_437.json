    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm about to install Verus, but I want to make sure it's safe. Can you give me the links to VirusTotal for the Verus software on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nHere are the links to VirusTotal for the Verus software on different operating systems:\n\n* MacOS: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/8d9a74da37c9b1be5f416c2f2f92f772b086da01770d8ed6a118778f87a7e568/detection\n* Linux-AMD64: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/27aa9d8d4a89dadf1a87928664eef7dc70ef92624d62596ee6e699b064f17daa/detection\n* Windows: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/e8f9b060d37e7028714d8c078705c8d6ceaef51b0d6f4c121cfbe40ab781b16f/detection\n\nYou can check the detection rates for each operating system to ensure the software is safe to install. Do you have any other questions about Verus or the installation process?\n\n**User:**\nWhat about warnings I might see during installation? What do they mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen installing Verus software, you may see warnings from antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky, flagging the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). These warnings are triggered because Verus software includes mining capabilities, which could be exploited by third parties to use your PC for their own gain. However, these warnings are false positives, and you can learn more about them by reviewing resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky.\n\nDon't worry, Verus is safe to install and use. These warnings are just a precautionary measure by your antivirus software. Do you have any other questions about the installation process or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nWhat's new in the latest Verus software release, X.X.X?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis release includes several notable changes, including:\n\n* Alleviation of peer banning behavior\n* Staking enhancements\n* Activation support for VerusID\n* Adjustments to the CPU and FPGA-equalizing VerusHash 2.1 Algorithm\n\nThese changes aim to improve the overall user experience and provide more features for Verus users. Do you have any specific questions about these changes or how they affect you?\n\n**User:**\nYou mentioned VerusID. What is it, and what benefits does it provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusID is a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides more than just an ID system. It is decentralized, with no corporation involved, and offers opportunities for identity applications. Specifically, VerusID provides:\n\n* Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\n* Fully decentralized protocol, allowing anyone to create an ID with complete, self-sovereign control\n* Ability to revoke, recover, inherit funds in existing UTXOs, which is unique to the Verus ecosystem\n\nVerusID offers a range of benefits, including privacy, security, and decentralization. It's a powerful tool for managing your digital identity and assets. Do you have any other questions about VerusID or how it works?",
