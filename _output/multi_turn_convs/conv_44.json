    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to send money to another Verus identity using the command line.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send money to another Verus identity using the `z_sendmany` or `sendtoaddress` commands. For example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ '[{\"address\":\"alice@\", \"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100\n```\n\nDo you have any more questions about sending money with Verus?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that helps. I was also curious about how the registration fee for a new identity in Verus is distributed.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without a referral or 80 VRSC with a referral, is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows: 20 VRSC to the referrer's ID, 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's ID, 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID, and 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined. 100% of all funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What are the two steps involved in making a Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe two steps involved in making a Verus ID are:\n\n1. Committing to a friendly name: This step registers your commitment to a name, but keeps the name secret until you register it and reveal your commitment.\n2. Registering the name: This step requires paying a fee of 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST with a referral) and reveals your commitment to the name.\n\nDo you have any more questions about creating a Verus ID?\n\n**User:**\nWhy are the two-step process of committing and registering a name necessary?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe two-step process is designed to prevent \"name front running\", where a selfish miner could replace your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead.\n\n**User:**\nI see. How does the referral system work when creating a Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen creating a Verus ID, you can use a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the registration fee is reduced to 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. The referral funds are distributed as follows:\n\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined\n\nAll funds not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to the funds that are not paid to referrers when registering a Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n100% of the funds that are not paid to referrers go to the miners or stakers of the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the benefit of having a Verus identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nHaving a Verus identity makes it easier to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. This means that you can use a name like \"bob@\" instead of a long, complicated address.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I make a new Verus identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMaking a new Verus identity requires two steps: committing to a name and registering the name. Committing to a name registers your commitment to a specific name, but keeps the name secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. Registering a name requires paying a fee of 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity, in which case the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of committing to a name before registering it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of committing to a name before registering it is to prevent \"name front running\", where a selfish miner could replace your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead.\n\n**User:**\nHow are the funds distributed when registering an identity with a referral?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen registering an identity with a referral, the funds are distributed as follows: 20 VRSC to the referrer's ID, 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's ID, 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID, and 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined. The remaining funds go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nHow much does it cost to register an identity, and how is the cost affected by having a referral?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRegistering an identity costs 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST without a referral, and 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST with a referral. The funds for a referral are distributed among the referrer, the referrer's referrer, the referrer's referrer's referrer, and the miner of the block in which the ID is mined.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",

Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows:- 20 VRSC to the referrer\u2019s ID - 20 VRSC to the referrer\u2019s referrer\u2019s ID - 20 VRSC to the referrer\u2019s referrer\u2019s referrer\u2019s ID - 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined100% of all funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.## To create an identity:",

Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ \u2018[{\u201caddress\u201d:\u201dalice@\u201d, \u201camount\u201d:100}]\u2019 ``` or ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100 ``` Making a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead.
