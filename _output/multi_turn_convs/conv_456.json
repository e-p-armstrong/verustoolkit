    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about ID registrations in fully decentralized fractional currencies. How are they paid for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, which reduces the supply and raises the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Can the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies be set in a reserve currency, such as USDC or DAI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves, such as USDC or DAI.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the deal with referral support in ID registration?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nReferral support in ID registration allows for multiple levels of referral (up to 5 levels), which can reduce the ID registration fee. When an ID is registered with a referral, the fee is divided evenly among past referrers, and the remaining amount is either burned for decentralized currencies or sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the differences between Native IDs and IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies. What can Native IDs do that the others can't?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNative IDs, registered directly from a blockchain, can launch currencies on that blockchain and have more capabilities. IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies, on the other hand, cannot launch currencies but are still valuable as revocation and recovery IDs, and can be used for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses, identity and NFT features, proofs, brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login. They can also cross-prove common ownership with other IDs.\n\n**User:**\nWait, I thought you said IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies can't launch currencies. Is there an exception?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is an exception. The *.veth gateway IDs, available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter, can create Ethereum mapped currencies.",

For fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone.

Each currency, either centralized and/or fractional, can have multiple levels of referral support (limit of 5 levels), meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies, or be sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.While Native IDs, those registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, will be able to launch currencies on that blockchain, and if on Verus, actual independent blockchains, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, but will still be valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features, for proofs, for brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login, and will have the ability to cross-prove common ownership with other IDs as well.The exception to non-native IDs creating currencies, is that *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter and will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies.
