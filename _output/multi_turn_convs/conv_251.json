    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was trying to use the Verus CLI, but I'm not sure about the format for entering commands on different operating systems. Can you help?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe format for entering Verus CLI commands varies depending on the operating system. On Windows, the commands should be entered without surrounding quotation marks. On Linux and MacOS, the commands should be preceded by `./` without surrounding quotation marks. Does that clarify things for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! How do I get a new public address using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo get a new public address using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus getnewaddress`. Simple and easy!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. How do I list my available public addresses using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo list your available public addresses using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus listaddressgroupings`. Give it a try!\n\n**User:**\nWhat about importing a VRSC private key of a R-address into my wallet using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo import a VRSC private key of a R-address into your wallet using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus importprivkey \"<PRIVATE_KEY>\"`, replacing `<PRIVATE_KEY>` with your specific private key.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I get my current VRSC balance using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo get your current VRSC balance using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus getbalance`. Alternatively, you can use `verus z_gettotalbalance` for more information, or `verus z_getbalance \"<z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>\"` for the balance of a specific address.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about sending VRSC coins from my Verus wallet to another VRSC address using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo send VRSC coins from your Verus wallet to another VRSC address using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus sendtoaddress \"<VRSC_address>\" <AMOUNT> \"<Some comments here>\"`, replacing `<VRSC_address>` with the recipient's address, `<AMOUNT>` with the amount to send, and `<Some comments here>` with optional comments.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I shield reward coins from all public addresses using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo shield reward coins from all public addresses using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\" \"<z-ADDRESS>\"`, replacing `<z-ADDRESS>` with the address to shield to.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about transferring VRSX from any address to any other address using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo transfer X VRSX from any (P-, i- and z-) address to any (P-, i- and z-) address using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus z_sendmany \"<z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>\" '[{\"amount\":<X>, \"address\":\"<Z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>\"}]'`, replacing `<z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>` with the source address, `<X>` with the amount to transfer, and `<Z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>` with the destination address.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question - how do I check the operation status of my `z_sendmany` or `z_shieldcoinbase` command using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo check the operation status of your `z_sendmany` or `z_shieldcoinbase` command using the Verus CLI, you can use the command `verus z_getoperationstatus`.",

So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address, so it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`.##### General remarks on CLI wallet: On Windows command line enter the commands as shown without the surrounding quotation marks In Linux shell preceed the commands without surrounding quotation marks with ./ In MacOS shell preceed the commands without surrounding quotation marks with ./ for example the windows version verus listtransactions transforms in Linux or MacOS to ./verus listtransactions.#####General remarks on Windows command line formatting: The CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS.
