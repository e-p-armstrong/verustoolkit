    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nHi! I heard about the upcoming Mainnet PBaaS Activation and I'm a bit concerned. What is the mandatory upgrade requirement for this event on May 21, 2023?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe mandatory upgrade requirement is to upgrade to v1.0.0 or a later version v1.0.0-x before May 21, 2023, to stay reliably connected to the mainnet. Make sure to upgrade to avoid any issues!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks! I've also been hearing about the Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP). Can you tell me more about it and how it differs from other cross-chain protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP) is a fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology that uses cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state. According to Verus, VIP is superior to and more decentralized than other cross-chain protocols like LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, and Thorchain. VIP offers a more secure and reliable way to interact between different blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds impressive! What new capabilities do VerusIDs gain with the PBaaS upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs gain the capability of VerusID Content Multimaps, which allows for unlimited provable data storage and can be used for various applications such as social networking, voting, oracles, publishing information, provable attestations, ratings, and more. This opens up a lot of possibilities for users!\n\n**User:**\nI see. And what's the significance of VerusID Content Multimaps in the context of AI and human data?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe scalability of PBaaS and VerusID Content Multimaps together make the Verus PBaaS network the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world. This is particularly important given the recent rise of AI. The possibilities for AI development and human-AI interaction are vast with this technology!",

            "The mandatory upgrade requirement is to upgrade to v1.0.0 or a later version v1.0.0-x before May 21, 2023, to stay reliably connected to the mainnet.",
            "1) **Mainnet PBaaS Activation MAY 21, 2023, EXPECTED BLOCK #2546600**: v1.0.0 is MANDATORY, meaning that you will need to upgrade to this release or a later version v1.0.0-x, before MAY 21, 2023 to stay reliably connected to mainnet. Testnet will also be reset within the next day, and this release will allow you to connect to the new testnet, which we see as a core development platform and staging area for the Verus PBaaS network and have no plans to reset in any foreseeable future.2) **Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP) - Layer 0 Multichain and Inter-chain Protocol**: To our knowledge, the VIP protocol is the only fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology available on any network that is based on cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state. From what we\u2019ve been able to learn about LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, Thorchain or others, VIP is different from (though closest in some ways to LayerZero), superior to, and more decentralized than all other cross-chain protocols we have seen. We can of course get into any level of discussion on the topic, but expect more descriptions and educational material to follow, now that the protocol was originally conceived of 5 years ago, and has been developed and tested/hardened for years.3) **VerusID Content Multimaps - Unlimited Provable Data for Every VerusID**: With the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs gain a powerful new capability that can be used for social networking, voting, oracles, publishing any information, various forms of provable attestations, ratings, and much, much more. With the scalability of PBaaS and VerusID content multimaps together, the Verus PBaaS network becomes the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world. We don\u2019t believe anything else even comes close, and with the recent rise of AI, it feels great to have this come together as a core original goal at a very appropriate and important time in history.",
