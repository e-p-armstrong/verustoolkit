    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some of the options in Verus. Can you tell me about the OPTION_ID_STAKING option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_ID_STAKING option, with a value of 4, allows all IDs on the chain to stake equally, rather than using value-based staking. This means that every ID has an equal opportunity to participate in the staking process, regardless of the value associated with it.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the OPTION_ID_REFERRALS option? What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_ID_REFERRALS option, with a value of 8, enables support for referrals on the chain. This allows IDs to refer other IDs and enables the referral system on the chain.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what's the difference between OPTION_ID_REFERRALS and OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_ID_REFERRALS option, with a value of 8, enables support for referrals on the chain, while the OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED option, with a value of 16, requires referrals on the chain. In other words, if OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED is set, an ID must have a referral to be valid, whereas with OPTION_ID_REFERRALS, referrals are supported but not required.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these options or Verus in general?",
