    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm having some issues with my wallet and I need some help with pruning spent transactions. How can I prune spent wallet transactions using the `prunespentwallettransactions` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `prunespentwallettransactions` command is used to remove spent transactions from your wallet. To use it, simply run the command in the Verus CLI. If you want to prune a specific transaction, you can pass the transaction ID as an argument to the command. For example:\n\n```\nverus prunespentwallettransactions \"1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d\"\n```\n\nThis will remove the specified transaction from your wallet. Do you have any other questions about pruning transactions or wallet maintenance?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for that! Another thing I'm having trouble with is my wallet's transaction history. I think I need to rescan the entire chain. How can I initiate a rescan of the entire chain using the `rescanfromheight` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo initiate a rescan of the entire chain, you can run the `rescanfromheight` command without specifying a height. This will rescan your wallet from the genesis block, which can be useful for recovering missing transactions or fixing wallet issues. Here's an example:\n\n```\nverus rescanfromheight\n```\n\nKeep in mind that this command can take a significant amount of time to complete, especially for very large wallets. Do you have any other questions about rescanning your wallet or transaction history?\n\n**User:**\nI was also looking at some old commands and saw `sendfrom`. What is the `sendfrom` command used for in Verus, and why is it deprecated?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendfrom` command is used to send an amount from an account to a VRSC address. However, it's deprecated and should not be used. Instead, you should use the `sendtoaddress` command for sending funds to a VRSC address. The `sendfrom` command is no longer supported and may cause issues with your wallet or transactions.\n\n**User:**\nI also saw the `rescanfromheight` command. What is it used for in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `rescanfromheight` command is used to rescan the current wallet from a specified height. This can be useful for recovering missing transactions or fixing wallet issues. You can specify a particular height to start the rescan from, or run the command without specifying a height to rescan the entire chain. As I mentioned earlier, this command can take a significant amount of time to complete, especially for very large wallets.",
