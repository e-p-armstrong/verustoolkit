    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` command, and I was wondering about the `returntxtemplate` option. What's the result if I set it to true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf `returntxtemplate` is set to true, the result of the `sendcurrency` command will be a JSON object containing the transaction template with all specified outputs and no inputs. The object will have two properties: `outputtotals` and `hextx`. This allows you to review and customize the transaction before actually sending it.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful. Another option I saw is `preconvert`. What's the purpose of that option in the `sendcurrency` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `preconvert` option in the `sendcurrency` command is used to convert the currency to the destination currency at the current market price. This option only works if the transaction is mined before the start of the currency. It's a convenient way to ensure that the transaction is processed correctly, taking into account the current market rates.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the `sendcurrency` command or Verus in general?",
