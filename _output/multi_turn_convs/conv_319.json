    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI need to update my Verus wallet and install the bootstrap. Can you guide me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUpdating your Verus wallet and installing the bootstrap is a straightforward process. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Make sure your wallet is not active.\n2. Backup essential files, including `wallet.dat` and `VRSC.conf`, to a safe location.\n3. Ensure you have the latest version of the Verus Wallet installed by downloading it from the provided link, verifying the SHA256 checksum and signature, and extracting the file to a suitable location.\n4. Install the bootstrap by downloading it from the provided link, verifying the checksum and signature (optional), removing all files and folders from the `VRSC Wallet Location` except `wallet.dat`, `debug.log`, `VRSC.conf`, and `VRSC-bootstrap.*`, and extracting the downloaded archive to the `VRSC Wallet Location`.\n5. If you had a VRSC wallet running before, restore essential files by copying `wallet.dat` from your safe location back to the `VRSC Wallet Location`.\n6. Start your wallet.\n\nDo you have any questions about these steps or would you like me to clarify anything?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I'm not sure how to verify the integrity of the downloaded Verus Wallet installer and bootstrap archive.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerifying the integrity of the downloaded files is an important step. You can do this by checking their SHA256 checksum and signature. This ensures that the files have not been tampered with during the download process. It's a good practice to always verify the integrity of downloaded files to ensure their authenticity.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! And what about the extracted `blocks` and `chainstate` folders after downloading the bootstrap archive? What should I do with them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter downloading the bootstrap archive, you should extract the `blocks` and `chainstate` folders to the `VRSC Wallet Location`. Make sure they are extracted to the correct folder and not to a different folder, such as a `VRSC-bootstrap` folder. If they are extracted to a different folder, move them to the `VRSC Wallet Location`. This will ensure that your wallet uses the correct bootstrap data.\n\nI hope that helps! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.",
