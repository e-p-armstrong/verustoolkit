    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm working on a Verus currency definition and I came across an option called `OPTION_GATEWAY`. What does it do when set?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `OPTION_GATEWAY` is set to 128 in a Verus currency definition, it means that this currency routes external currencies. In other words, it acts as a gateway for other currencies, allowing them to be used within the Verus ecosystem.\n\nDo you have any more questions about `OPTION_GATEWAY` or Verus currency definitions in general?",
