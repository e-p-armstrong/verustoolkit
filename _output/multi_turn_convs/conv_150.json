    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand more about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the implied volatility fee. What is it, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe implied volatility fee is a fee that will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions. It's intended to ensure that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers' risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. The fee will be higher for blocks that change the price of a currency significantly, and lower for currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How does Verus make it easy to launch a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus makes it easy to launch a new currency by providing a Kickstarter-like system with minimums to activate or automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations. All of these features are specified in easy-to-understand commands and parameters, with no programming necessary.\n\n**User:**\nWhat features are available for currencies launched on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrencies launched on the Verus network can accept a range of other currencies and can be launched with or without fractional reserve capabilities. Additionally, the Verus import/export protocol makes it easy to integrate with other blockchains, and external bridges are in progress to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens.\n\n**User:**\nI was still curious about the implied volatility fee. What is its purpose, and how will it be charged?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe implied volatility fee is intended to offset the potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers' risk. It will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee. This fee will be used to ensure that relatively volatile currency baskets offset the risk with earnings from implied volatility fees, while less volatile currency baskets will have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers.\n\n**User:**\nHow can a currency be launched on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA currency can be launched on the Verus network with a Kickstarter-like minimum to activate, or if not met, automatically refund. The launch process includes dynamic currency launch pricing based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy-to-understand commands and parameters, with no programming necessary.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the fee for conversions on the Verus network, and where does it go?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe fee for conversions on the Verus network is 0.025%. 100% of this fee goes to miners and stakers.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the future of merge mining and multi-chain technology on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology, which was previously running on testnet, will soon be available on the mainnet. This technology will enable Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies.",
