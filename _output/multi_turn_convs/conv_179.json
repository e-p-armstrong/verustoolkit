    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating a new currency on the Verus network, and I was wondering what features can be enabled when launching a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen launching a new currency on the Verus network, it can be configured to accept a range of other currencies and with or without fractional reserve capabilities. Additionally, the Verus import/export protocol makes it easy to integrate with other blockchains, and there are already bridges in progress to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard about the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology. What's the significance of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology allows Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously. This technology enables all network blockchains to provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies. It's a really powerful feature!\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `sendcurrency` API, and I was wondering, how can I convert VRSCTEST to another currency using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to another currency using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"TESTCOIN\"}]'\n```\nGive it a try and see how it works!\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. What if I want to preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency before it is active using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency before it is active using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\nJust keep in mind that you need to specify the `preconvert` option and provide a refund address.\n\n**User:**\nI've got it. How can I send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nJust specify the source address, destination address, and amount, and you're good to go!\n\n**User:**\nOne last question: How can I send VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to multiple recipients using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to multiple recipients using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nJust use the `*` wildcard to specify all wallet funds, and provide a list of recipients with their respective amounts.",
