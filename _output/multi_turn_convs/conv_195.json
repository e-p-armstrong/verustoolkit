    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been wondering about immature blocks. How can I determine when an immature block will mature (unlock)?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo determine when an immature block will mature, follow these steps:\n\n1. Get the current block height (\"blocks\") and the \"blockstomaturity\" value, which is the distance to maturity of the transaction in question.\n2. Apply the formula: `blockstomaturity / 1440 = days to maturity (unlocking)`.\n\nFor example, if `blockstomaturity` is 925558, the calculation would be `925558 / 1440 = 643 days`. This means the block will mature in 643 days. Do you have any questions about this process or would you like more information about blocks in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I'm a bit unclear about what the `blockstomaturity` value represents. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `blockstomaturity` value represents the distance to maturity of the transaction in question, which is the number of blocks between the current block height and where it unlocks. This value decreases over time, and adding it to the current block height will reveal a constant value. Think of it as a countdown to when the block will mature. Does that make sense?",
