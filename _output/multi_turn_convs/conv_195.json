    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you with any questions you may have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been using VRSCTEST for a while, but I've updated to a new version. What should I do if I have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release, you should delete the following directories before running this new update:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST` and `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\VerusTest`\n\nThis will ensure a clean start with the new version. Do you have any other questions about VRSCTEST?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, how do I launch the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch the testnet, you can run the command `./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST`. Simple as that!\n\n**User:**\nAlso, what's the disclaimer for using this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nImportant to know! This software is experimental and unfinished, and should be used at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\n**User:**\nI've noticed that my antivirus software is flagging this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and you can find more information about it at the provided links: https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/ and https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/. Don't worry, it's just a false alarm!",
