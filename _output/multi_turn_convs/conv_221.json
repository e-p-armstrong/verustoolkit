    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about Verus DeFi. Can you tell me about Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies, and how they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi fractional basket currencies are a type of currency that is backed by one or more asset currencies, with a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. These currencies are part of the Verus DeFi protocol, which ensures that all currency conversions using a particular liquidity pool and mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers. Would you like me to explain more about how Verus DeFi addresses MEV and front-running?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that would be great. How does the Verus DeFi protocol address the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This prevents miners from exploiting price differences across different liquidity pools and ensures a fair and transparent conversion process. It's an innovative solution that creates a more equitable and secure DeFi environment. Do you have any other questions about Verus DeFi?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. What is the significance of simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches allow for the creation of a new blockchain and a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool at the same time. This enables the new blockchain to have its own liquidity pool, with fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool earned on the new blockchain, without any rent going back to the Verus blockchain. It's a game-changer for blockchain creation and liquidity pool management. Do you have any questions about crowdfunding currency launches in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I do. How do blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches work in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches allow for the creation of new currencies with minimum participation or automatic refunds. Creators can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. It's a flexible and user-friendly way to launch new currencies and bring innovation to the blockchain space. Do you have any more questions about Verus or Verus DeFi?",
