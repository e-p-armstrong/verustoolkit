    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, so I've been using an older version of VRSCTEST. What should I do before running the new update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you've been using a version of VRSCTEST prior to the latest release, you should delete certain directories before running the new update. The directories to delete depend on your operating system. On Linux, you'll need to delete `~/.komodo/vrsctest`. On MacOS, delete `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`. And on Windows, delete `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`. Doing this will ensure a smooth transition to the latest release.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks! I'm also curious, what kind of disclaimer does the software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software comes with a disclaimer stating that it is experimental and unfinished, and that you use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the software is provided \"as is\", without any express or implied warranties. So, please be aware of that before using the software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. One more thing - my antivirus software is flagging the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDon't worry, that's likely a false positive warning! Your antivirus software might be flagging the software because it's mining software, which can sometimes be installed by third parties to exploit your PC. You can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives. It's just a precautionary measure to ensure your system's security.",
