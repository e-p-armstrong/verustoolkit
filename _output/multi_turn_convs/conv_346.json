    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about verifying downloads. What's included in the txt file for verifying downloads?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe txt file for verifying downloads includes the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". Do you have any more questions about verifying downloads?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what's the result of a successful verification using the CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of a successful verification using the CLI is simply `true`. You'll know it's been verified correctly if you see that output. Do you have any more questions about the CLI or verification?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I was curious about some of the new features in Verus CLI v0.6.4. Can you tell me about those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the new features in Verus CLI v0.6.4 include estimated active staking supply displayed in output from `getmininginfo`, average block fees for last 100 blocks displayed in `getmininginfo` output, immature coins, including time-locked coins displayed in `coinsupply` output, eligible staking balance, with consideration for all disqualifying factors displayed in `getwalletinfo` output, `z_exportwallet` as wallet backup now accepts boolean parameter to remove all addresses with no UTXOs or Identities in the backup, staking performance is improved, and a fixed rare condition of improper ID wallet synchronization of transferred or revoked IDs.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really cool! I was also wondering, what's unique about Verus digital signatures?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer the first worldwide verifiable, decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft. This is unique compared to traditional blockchain signatures, which lack critical capabilities such as friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. How can I verify a file directly using the CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify a file directly using the CLI with the following command:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AcFjDQABQSDvcPZH+EBJHnQR491hRjINjwGtaVf3S8wFwNAY0KwYF1Qj3z0kndcLIJKqDCVKWj5RarHjCApwUGbjYK4x29Uc /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.6.4-amd64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.6.4-amd64.tar.gz\n```\nJust replace the file path and details with your own, and you're good to go!",
