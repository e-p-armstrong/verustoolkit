    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the warranty or liability that comes with the Verus software. Is there any kind of protection or guarantee?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. So, essentially, you use the software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I was also wondering about using a currency name for a PBaaS chain in the Verus Desktop. Is there a limitation to that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, currently, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. However, this limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability. So, you'll have more flexibility with PBaaS chains in the future.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. One more thing, I was trying to install the Verus software, and my antivirus software flagged it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Is that something I should be concerned about?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it includes mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. These warnings are false positives, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about them. You're safe to ignore those warnings and continue with the installation.",
