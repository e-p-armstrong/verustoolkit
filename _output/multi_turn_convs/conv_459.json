    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm a bit concerned about using the Verus software. What kind of risks are associated with using experimental and unfinished software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a valid concern! This software is experimental and unfinished, and its use comes with no warranty. You use it at your own risk, and the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from its use. It's essential to understand that you're using this software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nSo, are there any warranties or guarantees provided with this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. You should be aware that there are no guarantees or warranties associated with using this software.\n\n**User:**\nI've noticed that my antivirus software flags this software as a potential threat. Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, these warnings are false positives, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about them. Don't worry, it's just a false alarm!\n\n**User:**\nFinally, are there any conditions for using, copying, modifying, or distributing this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. Otherwise, there are no restrictions on using, copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, sublicensing, or selling copies of the software. Just make sure to include the copyright notice and permission notice, and you're good to go!",
