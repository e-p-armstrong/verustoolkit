    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nYeah, so I've been looking at using Verus, but I want to make sure I understand the risks. What is the disclaimer for using this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer for using this software is that it is experimental and unfinished, and you use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. It's essential to understand this before moving forward with using Verus.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I've been using VRSCTEST for a bit, but I think I need to update. What should I do if I have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this new update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this new update, you need to delete certain directories before running this new update. The directories to delete depend on your operating system. For Linux, you'll need to delete `~/.komodo/vrsctest`. For MacOS, it's `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`. And for Windows, you'll need to delete `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`. Be sure to delete these directories before running the new update to avoid any potential issues.",
