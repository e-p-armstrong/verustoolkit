    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been hearing about VerusHash, and I was wondering, what's the main change introduced by VerusHash 2.1 compared to VerusHash 2.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which is expected to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been using the Verus Desktop software, and I noticed a disclaimer when I installed it. What does it say?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer states that this is experimental and unfinished software, and users should use it at their own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about VerusIDs and how they're supposed to be private and powerful. Can you tell me more about the zero-knowledge private addresses and content map of key-value hashes in a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe zero-knowledge private addresses and content map of key-value hashes in a VerusID are used for private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity. They can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and are intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies. Additionally, when quantum secure signatures become available, these private addresses and content maps will be attested to with them.\n\n**User:**\nGoing back to VerusHash, what was the goal of the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm, and how did it achieve it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe goal of the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was to equalize the dominance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) over CPUs (Central Processing Units) on the Verus network. VerusHash 2.0 achieved this goal by developing an algorithm that explicitly equalized FPGAs and modern CPUs, keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU.",

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU.

Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network. # DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
