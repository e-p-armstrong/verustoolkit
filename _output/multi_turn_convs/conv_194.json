    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to set up the Verus mining software, but my antivirus software keeps flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question! Antivirus software may flag the Verus mining software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This warning does not necessarily mean that the software is malicious, but rather that it has the potential to be used for malicious purposes if installed by an unauthorized party. It's just a precautionary measure to alert you to the potential risks.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I've also been seeing some updates to the Verus software. What's the significance of upgrading to version 0.5.5 or greater?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUpgrading to version 0.5.5 or greater of the Verus software is important because it introduces a portability fix for a fault on some CPUs that did not support optimized mining. This allows mining on CPUs that don't support optimizations, although they will be relatively slow. It is recommended to upgrade to 0.5.5 or greater as soon as possible to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What kind of warranty or liability does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. So, where can I find more information about these false positive warnings from antivirus software for the Verus mining software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about the false positive warnings from antivirus software for the Verus mining software by reviewing the following resources: https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/ and https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/.
