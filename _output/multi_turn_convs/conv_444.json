    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to check if a coin is staked or mined using Verus Desktop. Do you know how I can do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus Desktop, you can check if a coin is staked or mined by going to the Mining Dashboard, entering Verus details, and scrolling down to the bottom of the page, where rewards are listed as `mined` or `minted` in green, and TXIDs that staked the minted rewards are shown in blue. That should give you the information you need!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's helpful. What if I'm using the Verus CLI instead? How can I distinguish between staked and mined coins using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo distinguish between staked and mined coins using the Verus CLI, you can follow these steps: use the `listtransactions` command to check the last 10 transactions, copy the blockhash of the received award, and add the blockhash to the end of `https://explorer.verus.io/api/getblock?` to check if the coin is minted or mined.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I think I understand now. But what's the purpose of the VerusExplorer in all this? How does it help me determine if a coin is staked or mined?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusExplorer, accessible at `https://explorer.verus.io/`, is a tool that helps determine if a coin is staked or mined by providing information about the blockhash of a transaction. By adding the blockhash to the end of `https://explorer.verus.io/api/getblock?`, you can check if the coin is minted or mined. So, in essence, the VerusExplorer is a useful resource that helps you verify the origin of a coin. Does that make sense?",
