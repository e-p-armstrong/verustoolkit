    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in launching a currency on Verus. What features are available for doing so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides various features for launching a currency, including: automatic refunds if minimum participation is not met, maximum participation limits in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds, pre-launch discounts for early participants, and vesting schedules for pre-allocations using VerusIDs. These features should give you a good degree of control over your currency launch. Do you have any questions about how these features work, or would you like to know more about a specific one?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard about \"locking\" an ID on Verus. What's that all about, and how do I do it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLocking an ID on Verus involves setting a time lock or time delay on the ID using the `setidentitytimelock` command. This can be done using the `unlockatblock` parameter to define the unlock height of the identity, or the `setunlockdelay` parameter to define a delay in blocks before the ID unlocks. This allows you to control when an ID can be used or modified. Do you have any questions about how to use this feature, or scenarios where it might be useful?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What happens when an ID is revoked on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an ID is revoked on Verus, its locked status is cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height that may have been set. So, even if you had set a lock on an ID, revoking it will immediately clear that lock. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nOne last thing: how does Verus handle minimum participation for crowdfunding currency launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus allows for setting a minimum level of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimum is not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, less network fees. This way, you can ensure that your currency launch has sufficient support before it begins. Do you have any other questions about Verus or currency launches?",

            "nt going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity. ### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge) - Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. #### Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**  The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\": <Unlock block height>}' ``` - **Time Delay:**  The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"setunlockdelay\": <Unlock block delay>}' ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ### Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g. BTC ETH:** ``` verus",
