    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use Verus Desktop with non-Verus chains, but I'm not sure what to do first. Can you help me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBefore executing a command in Verus Desktop for non-Verus chains, you must select the appropriate coin in the top right corner of the Verus Desktop interface. This is an important step to ensure you're working with the correct chain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! I'm also trying to figure out where the base directories are located for Komodo and Komodo asset chains on different operating systems. Do you know?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe base directories for Komodo are:\n* Linux: `~/.Komodo`\n* Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo`\n\nFor Komodo asset chains, the directory is a folder within the `komodo` base directory, with the official coin designation (e.g., `komodo/PIRATE`). So, for example, if you're working with the PIRATE asset chain, you'd find it in `~/.Komodo/PIRATE` on Linux.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!",
