    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about the Verus software and its warranty or liability. What kind of warranty or liability does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. Do you have any further questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I've had some issues with antivirus software flagging the Verus software. Why might antivirus software like Avast or Kaspersky flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question! The antivirus software might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it includes mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and the software is not malicious. Don't worry, it's just a precautionary measure by the antivirus software.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about an update to the Verus mainnet protocol. What update was made to the Verus mainnet protocol at block 800200?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAt block 800200, the Verus mainnet protocol was updated to include VerusID. That's a big milestone for Verus!\n\n**User:**\nWhat is VerusID, and how is it different from other blockchain ID implementations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusID is a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. VerusIDs provide opportunities for identity applications and offer features such as revocability, recoverability, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses. It's a game-changer for digital identity and asset management! Do you have any more questions about VerusID or Verus in general?",
