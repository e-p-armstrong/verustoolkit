    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to assist you with any Verus-related questions. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to set up Verus on my ARM Linux system, and I need to know where the standard locations for some files are. Where are the standard locations for Verus `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata, and `VRSC.conf` files on an ARM Linux system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn an ARM Linux system, the standard locations for Verus `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata, and `VRSC.conf` files are in the `~/.komodo/VRSC` directory. However, due to the size of the blockchain, this directory is usually stored on a mounted external hard drive, which has its own file path that was specified when the drive was mounted. Do you have any other questions about setting up Verus on your ARM Linux system?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. How do I navigate to the directory that contains the Verus daemon binary file?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo navigate to the directory that contains the Verus daemon binary file, you can use the command `cd verus-cli` (assuming the default location is in the home directory, i.e., `~/verus-cli`). This should take you to the directory where the Verus daemon binary file is located. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nI'm still setting up Verus, and I need to download the latest ARM64 version of the Verus CLI wallet. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can download the latest ARM64 version of the Verus CLI wallet by using the command `wget https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/download/v0.7.3-10/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tgz` (replace v0.7.3-10 with the latest version number). This will download the latest version of the Verus CLI wallet for ARM64 systems. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nThat worked! Now I need to unpack/unzip the downloaded file. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can unpack/unzip the downloaded file using the command `tar -xvf Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tgz`. This will extract the contents of the downloaded file, and you should see the Verus CLI wallet files in the resulting directory. Do you have any other questions about setting up Verus?\n\n**User:**\nFinally, how do I check if the Verus daemon is running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo check if the Verus daemon is running, you can use the command `top`. This will display a list of processes, and you should see `verusd` in the list. If it's not running, you can start it using the command `./verusd`. That should get the Verus daemon up and running! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
