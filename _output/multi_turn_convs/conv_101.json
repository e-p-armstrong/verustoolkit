    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus or Linux. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm actually trying to improve the security of my Linux system. How can I disable login with the Root User?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDisabling Root User login is a great security measure. To do so, you'll need to edit the SSH configuration file. Here's how:\n\nFirst, open the SSH configuration file using `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`.\n\nNext, find the line `PermitRootLogin yes` and set it to `PermitRootLogin no`.\n\nFinally, apply the new settings by restarting the SSH service using `sudo systemctl restart sshd`.\n\nBy doing this, you'll prevent anyone from logging in directly as the Root User, which reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your system. Do you have any other questions about Linux security or Verus?",
