    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about ID registration fees. Can the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies be set in a reserve currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself, or in one of its reserves, such as USDC or DAI. That way, you have flexibility in choosing the currency you want to use for ID registration.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What happens to the ID registration fee for fully decentralized fractional currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFor fully decentralized fractional currencies, the ID registration fee is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone. This way, the community benefits from the registration process.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been wondering about the differences between Native IDs and IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies. Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNative IDs, registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, can launch currencies on that blockchain, while IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, but will still be valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs. So, Native IDs have more capabilities, but both types of IDs are useful in their own ways.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! I also had a question about referral support for ID registration. Is there a limit on the number of levels of referral support?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is a limit of 5 levels of referral support for ID registration, meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. This encourages people to refer others to register IDs, which benefits the community.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a great incentive. I also had a question about non-native IDs creating currencies. Are there any exceptions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe exception is that *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter and will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. So, while non-native IDs can't create currencies in general, there's an exception for these specific IDs.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, how can fractional and centralized currencies issue IDs using their own currency as the payment currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFractional and centralized currencies can issue IDs using their own currency as the payment currency through a decentralized operation, with options for price, referrals, and permission from the currency identity required. This allows these currencies to have more control over their ID registration process.",
