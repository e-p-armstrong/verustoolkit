    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! We were discussing VerusIDs earlier. Now, I'd like to move on to tokens in the Verus network. Do you have any questions about how they work?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. How can tokens be used in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies. They can also be used for various purposes, such as payment models, tickets, point systems, etc. Additionally, tokens can be controlled by the blockchain or be partially blockchain controlled, centralized tokens, with currencies that are mintable at any time by the ID behind them.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What happens if the minimum participation is not met by the currency's start block during a token launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the minimum participation is not met by the currency's start block during a token launch, all participation will be refunded, less a minimal transfer/network fee, which was already allocated to miners/stakers. This ensures that participants aren't left with losses if the minimum participation isn't met.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What's the significance of the controlling ID behind a token?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe controlling ID behind a token can receive aggregated outgoing transactions to external systems that both burn coins and pass account data in the process. This allows applications to control currency supplies on the public network, whether these applications are external, decentralized networks or centralized custodial systems. It gives the controlling ID a lot of flexibility and control over the token.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really powerful. What's the advantage of using tokens in the Verus network for various use cases, such as club coins, game tokens, token launches, etc.?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe biggest advantage is that no programming is required to use tokens in the Verus network for various use cases, such as club coins, game tokens, token launches, etc. This makes it really easy to create and manage tokens for different purposes, without needing to be a developer or have extensive technical knowledge.",

Tokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies as well. Token launches can accept multiple other coins or tokens for conversion to the new token with payment to the token ID.
