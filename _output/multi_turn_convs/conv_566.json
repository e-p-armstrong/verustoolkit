    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about ID registration fees for fractional and centralized currencies. Can they be reduced, and if so, how?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, ID registration fees can be reduced for fractional and centralized currencies. This can be achieved through referral support, which means that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred, and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies or sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What are the limitations of IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies compared to Native IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, unlike Native IDs, which are registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent. However, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies are still valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs, as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features.\n\n**User:**\nIs there an exception to the rule that IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot create currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is an exception. *.veth gateway IDs, which are available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter, will be able to create Ethereum-mapped currencies. Registration of.veth IDs will be priced at a level to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the key difference in ID registration for decentralized fractional currencies versus centralized currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe key difference is that for fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves. For centralized currencies, the ID registration fee is sent to the currency ID.\n\n**User:**\nHow can the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies be set?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves, such as USDC or DAI.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of referral support for ID registration fees?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nReferral support allows for multiple levels of referral support (up to 5 levels), which means that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. This incentivizes referrals and promotes the adoption of currencies.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the limit on the number of levels of referral support for ID registration?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is a limit of 5 levels of referral support for ID registration, meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers.\n\n**User:**\nHow are ID registrations paid for in fully decentralized fractional currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, which reduces the supply and raises the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the significance of referrals in ID registration for fractional and centralized currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nReferrals play a role in ID registration for fractional and centralized currencies, where the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred, and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. This can lead to a reduction in the ID registration fee for users who are referred by existing IDs.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the differences between Native IDs and IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNative IDs, registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, can launch currencies on that blockchain, whereas IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies. However, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies are still valuable as revocation and recovery IDs, and can be used for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with various features.\n\n**User:**\nHow can fractional and centralized currencies with a `proofprotocol` of 2 issue IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFractional and centralized currencies with a `proofprotocol` of 2 can issue IDs as a decentralized operation. They can also sell IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, and permission from the currency identity required.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to the ID registration fee for fully decentralized fractional currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFor fully decentralized fractional currencies, the ID registration fee is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, which reduces the supply and raises the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves. The minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the difference between Native IDs and IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNative IDs, registered directly from a blockchain, can launch currencies on that blockchain, while IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies. However, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies are still valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs and have various other use cases, such as personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses, proofs, brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the exception to non-native IDs creating currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe exception is that *.veth gateway IDs, available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter, will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. Registration of.veth IDs will be priced at a level to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity.\n\n**User:**\nCan the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies be set in a reserve currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself, or in one of its reserves, such as USDC or DAI.",
