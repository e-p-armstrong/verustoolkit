    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been looking into VerusPay and I'm curious about the process. What happens to an order when it is submitted via the VerusPay gateway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an order is submitted via the VerusPay gateway, it is placed \"on-hold\" while awaiting payment from the customer. The customer has a limited time to send the payment, and the store monitors the wallet/address to confirm payment received before releasing the order and redirecting the customer to the Thank You page. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. I was also wondering, how does VerusPay communicate with the blockchain explorer and the veruspay.io API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusPay uses limited API functionality for Manual Mode to communicate with the blockchain explorer in verifying payments and with the veruspay.io API to get up-to-date price data. The API's do not receive any private data about the store owner, store, or customer. Would you like me to explain further?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's clear. What kind of data is sent to the blockchain explorer API and the VerusPay.io API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe only data sent to the blockchain explorer API is the public/transparent blockchain transaction and address used. For VerusPay.io API price data, only the store-set currency is sent to retrieve the current fiat exchange rate for Verus Coin.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I'm also interested in contributing to the Verus project. How can I help spread the word about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can contribute to the Verus project by submitting graphical or textual content that can be used to help support the upcoming mainnet launch. You can also help spread the word by posting and utilizing social media tools to generate new interested users. Every bit counts!\n\n**User:**\nI see. And speaking of the mainnet launch, what's the significance of it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe upcoming Verus mainnet release has the potential to revolutionize both the financial and technical sides of fintech and send shockwaves across many industries. It's a very exciting time for Verus and its community!",
