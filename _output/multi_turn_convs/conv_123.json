    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nSo, I've been using VRSCTEST for a while, but I haven't updated in a bit. What do I need to do if I have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release, you need to delete the following directories before running this new update:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nThis will ensure a smooth transition to the new version. Do you have any other questions about VRSCTEST or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I was wondering, what kind of software is Verus Desktop, and what kind of risk am I taking by using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Desktop is experimental and unfinished software, and you use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage. You should be aware that there are no guarantees of the software's performance or security. It's essential to keep this in mind when using the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What are the terms and conditions of using this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I've also noticed that some antivirus software flags this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can find more information about it on the Malwarebytes and Kaspersky blogs. Don't worry, it's a common issue with mining software, and Verus Desktop is safe to use.",
