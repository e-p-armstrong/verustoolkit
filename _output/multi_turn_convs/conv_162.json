    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to send multiple transactions at once using the `sendmany` command. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendmany` command allows you to send multiple transactions at once. The syntax is as follows:\n```\nverus sendmany \"fromaccount\" {\"address\":amount,...} ( minconf \"comment\" [\"address\",...] )\n```\nFor example:\n```\nverus sendmany \"\" {\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\":0.01, \"anotheraddress\":0.02} 6 \"donation\" [\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\", \"anotheraddress\"]\n```\nThis will send 0.01 VRSC to `RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV` and 0.02 VRSC to `anotheraddress`, with a minimum of 6 confirmations. Do you have any other questions about using the `sendmany` command?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that helps a lot. But I also have a question about sending VRSC using the `verus` command. How do I send 0.01 VRSC from the default account to a specific address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the following command to send 0.01 VRSC from the default account to a specific address:\n```\nverus sendfrom \"\" \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 0.01\n```\nThis will send 0.01 VRSC from the default account to the address `RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV`. Do you have any questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's clear. But what's the purpose of the `minconf` argument in the `sendfrom` and `sendmany` commands?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `minconf` argument specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for the transaction to be considered valid. This means that the transaction will only be sent if the account has a balance confirmed at least `minconf` times. It's a way to ensure that the transaction is sent only when the account has a sufficient confirmed balance. Do you have any more questions about using Verus?",
