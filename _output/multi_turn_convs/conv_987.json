    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the RPC calls, and I was wondering, what is the `getvdxfid` RPC call used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getvdxfid` RPC call is used to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys, which can be used to create self-sovereign, decentralized, rent-free, non-cancelable social media profiles and other applications. Do you have any plans for using VDXF keys in a project?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I'm trying to export an ID to a PBaaS chain. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nThis command exports the ID \"IDNAME@\" to the PBaaS chain \"PBaaSChainName\" with an amount of 100 VRSCTEST. Let me know if you have any issues with the command!\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I've also heard that there was a recent testnet reset. What are the key features in the latest testnet reset?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe latest testnet reset includes the following key features:\n\n1. Fixes for all reported PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID user issues.\n2. Support for the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge.\n3. Support for the new `getvdxfid` RPC call for generating VDXF keys.\n4. Fix for the Electron certificate issue in the GUI wallet.\n5. Support for additional popular ERC20 currencies.\n6. Fix for calculated balances of specific addresses sometimes showing lower than actual.\n7. Additional hardening, fixes, and improvements focused on mainnet and the Ethereum bridge.\n\n**User:**\nSounds like a big update! How do I reset my testnet after the latest update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your testnet, make sure Verus is closed and no testnet daemon is running. Then, delete the following directories:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`\n* On Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`\n* On Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\VRSC\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`\n\nAfter deleting the directories, restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native).",

            "1. Testnet reset with fixes for all reported PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID user issues. If you had reported issues, please verify that the issues you reported are addressed in this release. 2. Support for the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge, which has been testing on private networks and which we hope to launch within a day or two after first vetting it on the release testing network with community test volunteers. 3. Support for the new `getvdxfid` RPC call, used along with your ID and published names to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys, which community members used to create the world\u2019s first self-sovereign, completely decentralized, rent-free, non-cancelable social media profiles as can be seen here: https://luckpool.net/profile/identity/mike.vrsc . Work is underway to document the VDXF keys defined and used for profiles as well as the process of setting up your own. While the capability is already extremely powerful, we should remind everyone that Verus is a platform, not a social network. The core technology is exciting, but what will be even more exciting is when businesses and entrepreneurs leverage it to enable new, self-sovereign user experiences, applications, and accompanying businesses to enable the future, truly decentralized web. 4. Fix for the Electron certificate issue in the GUI wallet, which has been affecting prices and preventing BTC fee calculation. 5. Support for some additional, popular ERC20 currencies, in anticipation of more usage after release of the ETH bridge. 6.
