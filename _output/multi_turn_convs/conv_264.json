    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the licensing terms of Verus. What kind of license does this software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis software comes with a permissive free software license, which grants users the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software, without restriction. Do you have any further questions about the license or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! But what about warranties or liabilities? Does the software provider offer any kind of warranty or liability protection?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nI understand. I've also noticed that my antivirus software is flagging Verus as a potential threat. Why might that be?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYour antivirus software might flag this software as a potential threat because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is mining software and could be used maliciously.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for clarifying that! Where can I find more information about these false positives reported by my antivirus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about the false positives reported by your antivirus software by reviewing the resources provided, such as the Malwarebytes blog post about PUP.Optional.BitcoinMiner and the Kaspersky blog post about \"not-a-virus\" software. These resources should give you a better understanding of why your antivirus software is flagging Verus and how to handle it. Do you have any more questions about Verus or antivirus software?",
