    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering, where are the VRSCTEST data files located on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VRSCTEST data files are located in the following directories:\n\n* Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST`\n* Mac OS: `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSCTEST`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST\\`\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nThanks! I've also been having some trouble with formatting commands for the CLI wallet. What's the difference between Windows and Linux/MacOS?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Windows, the CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS. To use these commands on Windows, you need to substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character, and substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters. That should do the trick!\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about joining the Verus testnet. What's the purpose of doing that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of joining the Verus testnet is to test the latest capabilities of Verus before they are released to mainnet, or to test if your goals are possible without spending VRSC (testnet coins hold no value). It's a great way to experiment and get familiar with the Verus ecosystem without risking any real assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. How do I join the Verus testnet using the Verus Desktop Wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo join the Verus testnet using the Verus Desktop Wallet, follow these steps:\n\n1. Start your Verus Desktop wallet.\n2. If you have never run Verus testnet on your system before, go to `settings` (cogwheel icon) and select `General Settings`.\n3. Select `Enable VRSCTEST`.\n4. Click `Save Changes` and restart Verus desktop.\n5. When logged in, click `Add Coin`, select `Verus Testnet` and click `Continue`.\n6. Select the startup parameters you desire (Native, Staking, mining, reindex blockchain, and/or rescan wallet) and click `Add Coin`.\n\nYou should now be connected to the Verus testnet! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
