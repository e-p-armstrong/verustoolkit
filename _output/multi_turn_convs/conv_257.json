    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind?\n\n**User:**\nI'm using Verus-Desktop in Lite Mode, but I want to switch to Native Mode. What do I need to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo switch from Lite Mode to Native Mode, you'll need a few files and links. Here's what you'll need:\n\n* Download the Verus Bootstrap from `https://bootstrap.verus.io`\n* Import your Lite wallet address in Verus Desktop native using the guide at `https://wiki.verus.io/#!how-to/how-to_convert-seed-to-wif.md`\n* Check the signature at `https://verus.io/verify-signatures`\n\nJust follow these steps, and you should be good to go!\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds relatively straightforward. But can you walk me through the process of importing my existing address into Verus-Desktop Native mode?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo import your existing address into Verus-Desktop Native mode, just follow the procedure described in the Verus wiki: [Import Lite wallet address in Verus Desktop native](https://wiki.verus.io/#!how-to/how-to_convert-seed-to-wif.md). It's a step-by-step guide that should help you import your address successfully.\n\n**User:**\nI'm not sure where to find some of the Verus files on my system. Can you tell me where the standard locations are for the `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata, and `VRSC.conf` files on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe standard locations for the Verus files vary depending on your operating system. Here's where you can usually find them:\n\n* On Linux, they're typically located at `~/.komodo/VRSC`\n* On Mac OS, you can find them at `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`\n* On Windows 10, they're usually at `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`\n* And if you're using Verus Desktop, you can find them by clicking `help`, then `Show Verus data folder (default)`\n\nKeep in mind that these are the default locations, and you might have changed them when you set up Verus. If you're still having trouble finding the files, feel free to ask!",
