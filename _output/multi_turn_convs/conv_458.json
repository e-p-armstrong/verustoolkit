    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been trying to figure out some commands in Verus, and I'm not sure what the `listidentities` command does. Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listidentities` command is used to list the identities associated with a Verus wallet. It's a way to see all the identities you have in your wallet.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Are there any optional arguments I can use with the `listidentities` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are three optional arguments you can use with the `listidentities` command: `includecanspend`, `includecansign`, and `includewatchonly`. These arguments can be used to filter the list of identities based on the level of control or access associated with each identity.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does the `includecanspend` argument do when used with the `listidentities` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `includecanspend` argument, when set to `true`, includes identities in the list for which the wallet has spend or authorization capabilities. This argument is set to `true` by default, so if you don't specify it, it will still include those identities. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about the `listidentities` command or Verus in general?",
