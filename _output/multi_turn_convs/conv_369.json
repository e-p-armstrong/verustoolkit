    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've got some questions about the software itself. What is the status of this software, and what kind of warranty or liability does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis software is experimental and unfinished. It comes with no warranty of any kind, and the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from its use. Keep that in mind when using the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What permissions are granted to users of this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsers are granted permission to deal in the software without restriction, including the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about conditions for using or distributing open-source software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that antivirus software might flag this software. Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAntivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky might flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus CLI download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus CLI download by using the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands with the signer's identity (\"Verus Coin Foundation@\") and the corresponding checksum or signature.",
