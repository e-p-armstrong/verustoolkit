    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about the Verus public testnet. What is it, and what features does it enable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus public testnet is a technology preview that enables anyone to create new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. It allows for cross-chain currency conversion and sending currencies between chains, with a standard protocol fee of 0.01% that goes to miners and stakers of the network. The conversions are fully decentralized, and the protocol calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a powerful tool. What kind of warranty or liability does the software provided by Verus come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software provided by Verus comes with no warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to download the Verus software, but my antivirus software keeps flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Is there something wrong with the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it includes mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC. These warnings are false positives, and users can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives. The Verus software is safe to use, and you can disregard these warnings.",
