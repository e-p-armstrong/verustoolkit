    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering, what is included in the `.txt` file that accompanies each Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `.txt` file includes the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. This information is important for verifying the authenticity of the downloaded archive. Do you have any further questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How do I verify the signature of a downloaded Verus archive?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the signature of a downloaded Verus archive, you need to:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted `.txt` file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the CLI to verify the signature. Would you like more information on how to use these commands?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands are used to verify the signature of a downloaded Verus archive or file. They take the signer's identity, signature, and file or hash as input and return `true` if the signature is valid. These commands are crucial for ensuring the authenticity of the downloaded archive. Do you have any more questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the significance of the release v0.9.4-3 of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe release v0.9.4-3 of Verus is a mandatory update for continued testnet use. It upgrades the testnet protocol to fix an issue with the Ethereum bridge and VRSCTEST mining and staking. It also fixes an issue with defining Ethereum NFT mapped tokens, which will allow users to define an Ethereum NFT as the token that controls revoke and recover for an ID. This update is essential for continued testnet functionality.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are NFT mapped tokens in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNFT mapped tokens in Verus are a new technology that allows users to define an Ethereum NFT as the token that controls revoke and recover for an ID. Once defined, the NFT can be sent from the Ethereum blockchain as a satoshi of that currency, exchanged trustlessly on the Verus on-chain P2P marketplace, and used to revoke and recover the ID which defined the token. This technology allows users to protect their NFTs with VerusID's revoke and recover technology, bind their NFT to the pseudonymous ID they use to log into applications, and extend and publish more than just the NFT.",

Similar to how you can define a token for tokenized ID control, an NFT mapped token, when defined, refers by contract and tokenid to a specific NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Once defined as the currency for a specific ID or sub-ID and linked to the Ethereum NFT, that NFT will be able to be sent over from the Ethereum blockchain as a satoshi of that currency, sent to any address or ID on the Verus blockchain, exchanged trustlessly on the Verus on-chain P2P marketplace, and used to revoke and recover the ID which defined the token. Once the contracts are updated, you will be able to mint NFTs on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet, and endow your Ethereum NFTs with all of the power of your specially named VerusID.
