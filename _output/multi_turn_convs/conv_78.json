    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out the `getcurrencybalance` command. What is the purpose of this command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencybalance` command is used to retrieve the total amount of VRSC received by a specific address. It can also be used to filter the results by the number of confirmations. It's a handy tool for keeping track of your VRSC balance.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I use the `getcurrencybalance` command to retrieve the total amount of VRSC received by an address with at least 5 confirmations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencybalance` command with the following syntax:\n```\nverus getcurrencybalance \"myaddress\" 5\n```\nThis will retrieve the total amount of VRSC received by the address \"myaddress\" with at least 5 confirmations. Just replace \"myaddress\" with the actual address you want to check, and you're good to go!",
