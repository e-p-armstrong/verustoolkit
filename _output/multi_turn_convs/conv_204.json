    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `z_mergetoaddress` command, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. Can you tell me more about its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_mergetoaddress` command is used to merge multiple UTXOs and notes into a single UTXO or note. It ignores protected coinbase UTXOs, which can be combined into a single note using `z_shieldcoinbase`. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really useful. But when I tried to use it, I got an error saying it was disabled. How do I enable the `z_mergetoaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable the `z_mergetoaddress` command, you need to restart verusd with the `-experimentalfeatures` and `-zmergetoaddress` command-line options, or add the following lines to the `VRSC.conf` file: `experimentalfeatures=1` and `zmergetoaddress=1`. Have you tried that?\n\n**User:**\nI'll give it a shot. But what happens to the UTXOs selected for merging when using `z_mergetoaddress`? Do they get destroyed or something?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe UTXOs selected for merging will be locked. If there is an error, they will be unlocked. You can use the RPC call `listlockunspent` to return a list of locked UTXOs. So don't worry, they're not destroyed, just locked temporarily.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Is there a way to limit the number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging using `z_mergetoaddress`? I don't want to merge too many at once.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can limit the number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging by setting the transparent limit and shielded limit parameters. If the transparent limit parameter is set to zero, and Overwinter is not yet active, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option will determine the number of UTXOs. After Overwinter has activated, `-mempooltxinputlimit` is ignored, and having a transparent input limit of zero will limit the number of UTXOs based on the size of the transaction. Any limit is constrained by the consensus rule defining a maximum transaction size of 100000 bytes before Sapling, and 2000000 bytes once Sapling activates.",
