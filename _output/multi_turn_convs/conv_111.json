    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to import an address with a lot of transactions into the GUI wallet, but it's taking forever. What should I expect when doing this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen importing an address with many transactions into the GUI wallet, you should expect a few things. First, the GUI wallet won't show any progress on the import, so it might seem like nothing is happening. You might also receive messages indicating that the RPC daemon is not reacting. Just be patient, as the import process will take a significant amount of time to complete in the background. It's a bit of a waiting game, but it'll get there eventually!\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, I guess. But why does importing a cryptocurrency address take so long to complete?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe import process takes a long time to complete because it has to process a large number of transactions associated with the address being imported. This can be a time-consuming process, especially if the address has a high transaction volume. It's like trying to sift through a huge pile of data, one transaction at a time! But trust me, it's worth the wait. Once the import is complete, you'll have full access to your address and its associated transactions.",
