    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand what's included in the txt file provided with each Verus download.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe txt file includes the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". This is an important step in verifying the authenticity of your download.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How do I actually verify the signature of a downloaded archive?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the signature of a downloaded archive, you need to:\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the result of a successful signature verification?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of a successful signature verification is simply `true`. It's a confirmation that the download is authentic and unaltered.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about Verus CLI v0.7.3-9. What are some of its key features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus CLI v0.7.3-9 includes features such as:\n* Improved bad node banning behavior\n* A fix for signrawtransaction that could sometimes result in failure of countersigning a multisig, ID-based raw transaction\n* Upgraded Verus multisig capabilities\n* Ability to issue \"sendcurrency\" commands with the source being a multisig ID, for which you do not have all the keys present in your wallet.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds impressive. How can I verify a file directly using the CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify a file directly using the CLI by running the following command:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <file_path>\n```\nReplace `<signature>` with the signature from the txt file and `<file_path>` with the path to the file you want to verify. This command will help you confirm the authenticity of the file.",

On mainnet, destinations for such a transaction can include IDs, private addresses with memos to a z-address or ID:private, and transparent addresses. On testnet, such transactions can include all that is possible on mainnet as well as multiple currencies, currency conversions, and cross-chain sends.To our knowledge, this release raises the industry standard for multisig capability and its support on public blockchain protocols to a new level, even before considering the multisig revocation and recovery capabilities.",
