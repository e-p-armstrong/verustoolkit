    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been playing around with some commands and I'm not entirely sure what one of them does. What is the result of the `signrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `signrawtransaction` command is a JSON object containing three properties: \"hex\" - the hex-encoded raw transaction with signature(s), \"complete\" - a boolean indicating if the transaction has a complete set of signatures, and \"errors\" - a JSON array of objects containing script verification errors (if any). Do you have any more questions about this command or its output?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! But I'm still not entirely sure why I'd use this command. What is the purpose of the `signrawtransaction` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `signrawtransaction` command is used to sign a transaction with a set of provided private keys. It takes four arguments: the transaction hex string, an optional array of previous dependent transaction outputs, an optional array of base58-encoded private keys for signing, and an optional signature hash type. This command is useful when you need to manually sign a transaction, for example, when creating a custom transaction or working with a wallet that doesn't support signing. Does that make sense?",
