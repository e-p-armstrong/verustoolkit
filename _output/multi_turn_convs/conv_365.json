    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get a better understanding of how Proof of Stake (PoS) works. How can I estimate the number of blocks I can expect to get on average from PoS with a certain amount of mature coins in my public address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use a staking calculator spreadsheet to estimate the number of blocks you can expect to get on average from PoS. The spreadsheet allows you to input your current block height and amount of coins you are staking, as well as a percentage for guessing how many coins are actually staking. This will give you an estimate of your average block reward. Have you tried using the spreadsheet already, or would you like more information on how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What about the block reward? When is the next halving, what is the block reward, and how long will it last?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the same staking calculator spreadsheet to find out when the next halving is, what the block reward will be, and how long it will last. The spreadsheet will show you how many days until the next halvings. It's a great tool for planning and understanding the block reward schedule.\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing. How can I find out how many timelocked coins have been unlocked and are mature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the staking calculator spreadsheet again to find out how many timelocked coins have been unlocked and are mature. The spreadsheet includes a calculation of timelocked coins being unlocked based on an average for the entire period, which should be fairly accurate. Just input your information, and the spreadsheet will do the rest. If you have any trouble using the spreadsheet, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you!",
