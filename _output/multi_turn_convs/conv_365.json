Additionally, the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for letting me know. I was also wondering, where can I find the virus scan results for the software on different platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find the virus scan results for the software on different platforms at the following links:\n* MacOS: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/08254d35e8693eb304b35d1cee55f03761b78ad76dc5e25d6e42b300fcdd4e50/detection\n* Linux-AMD64: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/aa4842153c54510626b171128265059da30ae2bbfca974ceecc4348abb67e544/detection\n* Linux-ARM64: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/8a23406c8726ccf2fced09a20f298590d334ea00dbbca02eeadfae3eb8349d95/detection\n* Windows: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/d274514424e2334a7695e74c20569e9267158f22303021539060da6d82ab482c/detection\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! One last question: what should I do if my antivirus software flags the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf your antivirus software flags the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", it's likely a false positive warning that you are installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. You can review the resources provided to learn more about these false positives and take appropriate action.",
