    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey, I was wondering about the `getlaunchinfo` command in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getlaunchinfo` command is used to retrieve information about the launch of a specific currency, including its definition, transaction ID, vout index of the launch notarization, partial transaction proof, launch notarization, and current notarization of the chain.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds useful. What exactly does the `getlaunchinfo` command return?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getlaunchinfo` command returns a JSON object containing the following information:\n\n1. `currencydefinition`: The full currency definition.\n2. `txid`: The transaction ID of the launch notarization.\n3. `voutnum`: The vout index of the launch notarization.\n4. `transactionproof`: A partial transaction proof of the launch transaction and output.\n5. `launchnotarization`: The final CPBaaSNotarization clearing launch or refund.\n6. `notarynotarization`: The current notarization of this chain.\n\nSo, it provides a comprehensive overview of the currency's launch details. Do you have any more questions about the `getlaunchinfo` command or Verus in general?",
