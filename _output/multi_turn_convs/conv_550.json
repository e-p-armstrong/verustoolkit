What is the purpose of the OPTION_ID_STAKING option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_ID_STAKING option, with a value of 4, allows all IDs on the chain to stake equally, rather than using value-based staking. This has implications for how the network is secured and maintained.

Do you have any more questions about gateways in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what is the purpose of the OPTION_PBAAS option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_PBAAS option, with a value of 256, indicates that the chain is a PBaaS chain definition. This option is related to how Verus defines and interacts with PBaaS chains. Would you like to know more about PBaaS in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What does the OPTION_GATEWAY option do in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_GATEWAY option, with a value of 128, indicates that the chain routes external currencies. This option is related to how Verus handles external currencies and gateway routing. Do you have any more questions about gateways in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do have a few more questions about options in Verus. What does the OPTION_NFT_TOKEN option do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_NFT_TOKEN option, with a value of 2048, allows for single satoshi NFT tokens, which tokenize control over the root ID. This option is related to how Verus handles NFTs and tokenization. Do you have any more questions about NFTs in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what is the purpose of the OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER option, with a value of 1024, controls top-level ID and currency registration on the launch chain when not set on a gateway. This option is related to how Verus handles gateway name controllers and registration. Would you like to know more about ID and currency registration in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What is the purpose of the OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY option, with a value of 64, allows PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to a single currency. This option is related to how Verus handles currency restrictions on PBaaS chains and gateways. Do you have any more questions about currency restrictions in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do have a few more questions about options in Verus. What does the OPTION_TOKEN option do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_TOKEN option, with a value of 32, indicates that the currency is a token, rather than a native currency. This option is related to how Verus handles tokens and native currencies. Do you have any more questions about tokens in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, one more question. What is the difference between OPTION_ID_REFERRALS and OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_ID_REFERRALS option, with a value of 8, enables support for referrals on the chain, while the OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED option, with a value of 16, requires referrals on the chain. So, the main difference is that one option enables referrals, while the other option makes them mandatory. Do you have any more questions about referrals in Verus?",
