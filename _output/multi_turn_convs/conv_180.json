    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I'm trying to use the Verus command line tool, and I was wondering how I can get a new shielded address for receiving payments?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get a new shielded address for receiving payments using the `z_getnewaddress` command. Here's an example:\n```\nverus z_getnewaddress\n```\nThis command returns a new Sapling address. You can also specify the type of address you want, such as \"sprout\" or \"sapling\":\n```\nverus z_getnewaddress sapling\n```\nDo you have any more questions about using the Verus command line tool?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How can I retrieve the result and status of an operation which has finished using the Verus command line tool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can retrieve the result and status of an operation which has finished using the `z_getoperationresult` command. Here's an example:\n```\nverus z_getoperationresult '[\"operationid\",... ]'\n```\nThis command returns a list of JSON objects containing the result and status of the operations with the specified ids. Do you have any more questions about using the Verus command line tool?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question, how can I export a wallet using the Verus command line tool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can export a wallet using the `z_exportwallet` command. Here's an example:\n```\nverus z_exportwallet \"test\"\n```\nThis command exports the wallet with the name \"test\". Do you have any more questions about using the Verus command line tool?\n\n**User:**\nOne last question, how can I get the balance of a specific address using the Verus command line tool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get the balance of a specific address using the `z_getbalance` command. Here's an example:\n```\nverus z_getbalance \"myaddress\"\n```\nThis command returns the total amount of KMD received by the address \"myaddress\". Do you have any more questions about using the Verus command line tool?",
