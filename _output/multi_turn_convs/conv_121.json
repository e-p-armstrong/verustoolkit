    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you with any questions about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey, I was wondering about listing transactions since a specific block hash using Verus. What arguments do I need to provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen listing transactions since a specific block hash using Verus, you'll need to provide the following arguments:\n\n1. \"blockhash\" (string, optional): The block hash to list transactions since.\n2. target-confirmations (numeric, optional): The confirmations required, must be 1 or more.\n3. includeWatchonly (bool, optional, default=false): Include transactions to watchonly addresses.\n\nDo you have any other questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. What kind of information will I get back when I list transactions since a specific block hash?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen listing transactions since a specific block hash using Verus, you'll get back the following information:\n\n1. \"transactions\": An array of transactions, each containing:\n\t* \"account\": The account name associated with the transaction (DEPRECATED).\n\t* \"address\": The VRSC address of the transaction.\n\t* \"category\": The transaction category (send, receive).\n\t* \"amount\": The amount in VRSC.\n\t* \"vout\": The vout value.\n\t* \"fee\": The amount of the fee in VRSC (only for send category).\n\t* \"confirmations\": The number of confirmations for the transaction.\n\t* \"blockhash\": The block hash containing the transaction.\n\t* \"blockindex\": The block index containing the transaction.\n\t* \"blocktime\": The block time in seconds since epoch.\n\t* \"txid\": The transaction id.\n\t* \"time\": The transaction time in seconds since epoch.\n\t* \"timereceived\": The time received in seconds since epoch.\n\t* \"comment\": Any comment associated with the transaction.\n\t* \"to\": Any comment to associated with the transaction.\n2. \"lastblock\": The hash of the last block.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing. What does the \"category\" field indicate in the transaction information returned by Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"category\" field in the transaction information returned by Verus indicates the type of transaction. It can be one of two values:\n\n* \"send\": Indicates a transaction with a negative amount, meaning VRSC was sent from the account.\n* \"receive\": Indicates a transaction with a positive amount, meaning VRSC was received by the account.\n\nNote that there is also a \"move\" category, which is used for transactions that move funds within the same account.",
