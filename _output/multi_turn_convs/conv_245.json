    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey! I'm trying to pool-mine on my MacOS and I keep hearing about deprioritizing the mining process. What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you deprioritize the mining process, you're preventing it from interfering with other processes running on your PC. This allows you to use CPU-heavy applications, like games, without the miner interfering. It's a way to ensure that your mining process doesn't hog all the system resources.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I'm using NHEQMINER, so how do I adjust the batchfile to run on low priority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo adjust the batchfile to run on low priority using NHEQMINER, you need to add `nice -n 19 ` in front of the command you normally use. For example: `nice -n 19./nheqminer -v -l pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -p x -t 6`. Make sure to replace the pool and address with your preferred pool and own address.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I think I've got it now.",

            "# MacOS pool-mining on low priority. Attention: Read it completely before use. ### Useful links for VRSC mining: [Miners download page](https://verus.io/get-vrsc) [Miner configuration guide](#!faq-macos\\mac-faq03-mining_guide.md) ## Procedure: In order to let your mining not interfere with other processes running on your PC, we'll need to deprioritize the mining process. This will result in your miner throttling down whenever your PC needs processing power. People have reported to be able to use CPU-heavy applications, like games, without the miner interfering, with this method. Because the Verus wallet (GUI and CLI) does a lot more than mining, it is not recommended to use this for a solo-mining setup. First thing you will need is pool-mining software. The link is supplied above this procedure. Download your preferred miner, extract it to your prefered location and configure the batchfile with the pool of your choice and your own mining address. Now we'll need to adjust the batchfile to run on low priority: #### NHEQMINER: - Run your miner as you normally would, with `nice -n 19 ` placed in front of the command you normally use,   for example:    `nice -n 19 ./nheqminer -v -l pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -p x -t 6`  - make sure you replace the pool (`pool.verus.io:9999`) with your prefered pool and the address   (`RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ`) with your own address. The address shown in this line is the veruscoin   foundation donation address. If desired change the identifier (`Donator`) to a name that easily identifies the   miner to you. Created by Oink.vrsc@.
