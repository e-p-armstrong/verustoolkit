    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related issues you might be experiencing. What's going on with your wallet?\n\n**User:**\nMy wallet is stuck on a specific block number and no longer synchronizes properly. What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDon't worry, I'm here to help! If your wallet is stuck, first check if your wallet's block height is significantly lower than the current block height on the Verus explorer (more than 10 blocks behind). If it is, follow this procedure: close your wallet, add nodes to your `VRSC.conf` file, save and exit, remove the `peers.dat` file, and then restart your wallet. If the problem persists, refer to the Verus wiki for further troubleshooting. Have you tried that already?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I haven't tried that yet. But before I do, I'm not sure where to find my wallet files. Where are the standard locations for Verus wallet files on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe standard locations for Verus wallet files are:\n\n* Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC`\n* Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`\n* OS independent through Verus Desktop: Click `help`, `Show Verus data folder (default)`\n\nYou should be able to find your files in one of those locations. Now, about those nodes... do you need help getting an updated list of working nodes for your wallet?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that would be great. How can I get an updated list of working nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEasy one! You can get an updated list of working nodes by messaging `/peerinfo` in the #tipbot channel on the Verus Discord. You'll get a list of nodes that are currently working properly.\n\n**User:**\nGreat, thanks for the help! Before I start troubleshooting, is there anything I should avoid doing?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen troubleshooting your Verus wallet, make sure not to remove any files or folders other than `peers.dat`, or you may need to bootstrap your wallet. That's a good rule of thumb to keep in mind. Now, go ahead and try the troubleshooting steps I mentioned earlier, and let me know if you need any further assistance!",
