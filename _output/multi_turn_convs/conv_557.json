What command do I need to run?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins of \"mycoin\" on the VRSCTEST chain, you need to run the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!\n\n**User:**\nI'm having some issues with the VRSCTEST testnet. What directories do I need to delete before launching it on Linux, MacOS, and Windows?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBefore launching the VRSCTEST testnet, you need to delete the following directories:\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST` and `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\VerusTest`\nMake sure to delete these directories and then try launching the testnet again.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I launch the VRSCTEST testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch the VRSCTEST testnet, you need to run the following command:\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST\n```\nThis should get the testnet up and running. Let me know if you have any further questions!\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand Verus Desktop a bit better. What kind of software is it, and what kind of risks are involved in using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Desktop is experimental and unfinished software, which means it's not yet fully developed or tested.
