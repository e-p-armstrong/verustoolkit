    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning about defining chains in Verus. What are the requirements for defining a chain in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a chain in Verus, there are a few requirements: a maximum of 3 eras are allowed, a minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations is required, and a minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization is required, and VRSCTEST must be present in the wallet to create a chain. Do you have any further questions about these requirements?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I do. How can I define a chain using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can define a chain using the `definechain` command with the following format:\n\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{\"name\":\"CHAINNAME\",\"paymentaddress\":\"ADDRESS\",\"premine\":AMOUNT,\"initialcontribution\":AMOUNT,\"conversion\":AMOUNT,\"minpreconvert\":AMOUNT,\"maxpreconvert\":AMOUNT,\"launchfee\":AMOUNT,\"billingperiod\":TIME,\"notarizationreward\":AMOUNT,\"eras\":[{\"reward\":AMOUNT,\"decay\":DECAY,\"halving\":HALVING,\"eraend\":END,\"eraoptions\":OPTIONS}],\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"ADDRESS:PORT\",\"paymentaddress\":\"ADDRESS\"}, {\"networkaddress\":\"ADDRESS:PORT\",\"paymentaddress\":\"ADDRESS\"}]}'\n```\n\nThis command defines a chain with the specified name, payment address, premine, initial contribution, conversion, minimum and maximum pre-conversion amounts, launch fee, billing period, notarization reward, eras, and nodes. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to contributions if the minimum contributions are not met when defining a chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the minimum contributions are not met when defining a chain, the chain will fail to start, and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors. No need to worry about losing your funds!\n\n**User:**\nAnd one last question. How can I connect to a defined chain using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can connect to a defined chain using the following command:\n\n```\n./verusd -chain=CHAINNAME\n```\n\nOn first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine. The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME`, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.",
