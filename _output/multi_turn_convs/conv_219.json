    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been trying to use the `z_shieldcoinbase` command, but I'm not really sure what arguments it requires. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required arguments for the `z_shieldcoinbase` command are:\n\n1. \"fromaddress\" (string, required) - The address is a taddr or \"*\" for all taddrs belonging to the wallet.\n2. \"toaddress\" (string, required) - The address is a zaddr.\n\nDo you have any further questions about this command or its arguments?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I think that helps a lot. But what does the command actually do, and what information does it provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `z_shieldcoinbase` command is a JSON object that provides the following information:\n\n* `remainingUTXOs`: The number of coinbase utxos still available for shielding.\n* `remainingValue`: The value of coinbase utxos still available for shielding.\n* `shieldingUTXOs`: The number of coinbase utxos being shielded.\n* `shieldingValue`: The value of coinbase utxos being shielded.\n* `opid`: An operation ID to pass to `z_getoperationstatus` to get the result of the operation.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that's really helpful. So, what's the purpose of this command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_shieldcoinbase` command is used to shield transparent coinbase funds by sending them to a shielded z-addr. This is an asynchronous operation, and the selected utxos will be locked during the process. If there's an error, they will be unlocked.\n\nDo you have any further questions about this command or its purpose?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I saw an optional \"fee\" argument in the command, but I'm not really sure what it's for or what its default value is.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe optional \"fee\" argument in the `z_shieldcoinbase` command is used to specify the fee amount to attach to this transaction. Its default value is 0.0001.\n\nDoes that help clarify things for you?",
