    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was wondering about liability. What kind of liability do the authors or copyright holders have for damages or other liability arising from the use of this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. This means that the authors or copyright holders are not responsible for any damages or liabilities that may arise from using the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I did have an issue with my antivirus software, actually. Why might some antivirus software flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Some antivirus software might flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit the user's PC. However, this is a false positive, and the software itself is not malicious.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What is the license under which this software is provided?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided under a permissive free software license, which grants the user the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software without restriction. This means that you have a lot of freedom to use and modify the software as you see fit.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about warranty? What kind of warranty is provided with this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo warranty of any kind is provided with this software. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that you use the software at your own risk, and the authors or copyright holders are not responsible for ensuring that it meets certain standards or works as expected.",
