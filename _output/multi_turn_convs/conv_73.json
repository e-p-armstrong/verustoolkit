    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Do you have any questions or concerns about using Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been using VRSCTEST and I just updated to the new release. What do I need to do now?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release, you need to delete the following directories before running this new update:\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST` and `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\VerusTest`\n\nThis will ensure that you can use the new version without any issues.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Now, how do I launch the testnet after updating?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch the testnet, you need to run the following command: `./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST`. This will get you up and running with the testnet.\n\n**User:**\nI've been using Verus Desktop, but I'm not entirely sure what it is or what the risks are. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Desktop is experimental and unfinished software. It's important to use it at your own risk, as no warranty is provided for any kind of damage. You are responsible for any potential risks or consequences of using this software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I did notice that my antivirus software flagged it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software may be flagged by antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it includes mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, this is a false positive, and the software is not malicious. You can review the resources provided to learn more about these false positives.\n\nDon't worry, it's just a false alarm!",
