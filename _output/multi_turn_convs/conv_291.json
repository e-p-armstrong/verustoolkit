    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some of the commands in Verus. Specifically, I want to know about the different ways to use the `setidentitytimelock` command.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `setidentitytimelock` command has three main uses. \n\n1. You can use `verus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":1796500}' (returntx)` to lock the ID until the specified block.\n2. You can use `verus setidentitytimelock '{\"setunlockdelay\":1440}' (returntx)` to set a 1440 block unlock delay, requiring you to wait before spending funds controlled by the ID after unlocking the ID (about one day unlock time).\n3. And you can use `verus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":0}' (returntx)` to unlock an ID that has been locked with an unlock delay, and the unlock time will be set to the block height at which the ID was unlocked + the originally set unlock delay.\n\nDo you have any questions about how to use this command or what it does?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. What about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace? How does that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where you can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) directly on-chain. You can advertise your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. You can pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, and accept payment to either as well.\n\nThe marketplace is a great way to monetize your unique digital assets and identities. Do you have any questions about how to use the marketplace?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that sounds straightforward. What about Verus Vault? How does it protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows you to protect funds on a VerusID, even in the event of private key theft. When you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. You can also still receive funds. Note that enabling revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities require you to have one primary identity, and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.\n\nVerus Vault adds an extra layer of security to your funds, and gives you peace of mind even if your private key is compromised. Do you have any questions about how to use Verus Vault?",
