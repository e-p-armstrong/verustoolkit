    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I just want to make sure I understand the risks. What is the disclaimer for using Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! The disclaimer states that the software is experimental and unfinished, and should be used at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The authors or copyright holders will not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. It's essential to keep this in mind when using Verus software.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for clarifying that. I've also been playing around with the Verus Desktop GUI, and I noticed something weird. What is a limitation of the Verus Desktop GUI regarding PBaaS chains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability. So, you'll need to keep that in mind when working with PBaaS chains in the GUI.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. And I've also been experimenting with creating currencies from IDs. What is a limitation of creating a currency from an ID in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. It is advised to avoid creating IDs with i-addresses as their names to prevent potential problems. So, be sure to keep that in mind when creating currencies from IDs.",
