    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a PBaaS blockchain using Verus. Can you tell me how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a PBaaS blockchain using Verus, you can use the `definecurrency` command with a JSON object that specifies the properties of the blockchain. Here's an example:\n\n```json\n./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"options\":330,\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\"],\"conversions\":[1],\"eras\":[{\"reward\":1200000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0}],\"notaries\":[\"Notary1@\",\"Notary2@\",\"Notary3@\"],\"minnotariesconfirm\":2,\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.111:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node1@\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.112:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node2@\"}],\"gatewayconvertername\":\"Bridge\",\"gatewayconverterissuance\":1000000}' '{\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\",\"PBaaSChain\",\"USD\"],\"initialcontributions\":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],\"initialsupply\":3000000}'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new PBaaS blockchain with the specified properties, including its name, options, currencies, conversions, eras, notaries, nodes, and gateway converter. Does that help? Do you have any questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I'm working with multi-currency in Verus, and I want to know what limitations I should be aware of.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are two limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus:\n\n1. **Avoid using i-addresses as names for IDs**: When creating a currency from an ID, you should not use an i-address as the actual name of the ID. This can cause problems when referring to the currency or identity, and is not supported.\n2. **Avoid using existing currency names for PBaaS chains**: In the Verus Desktop GUI, you cannot use the same name for a PBaaS chain as an existing supported currency, such as BTC or ETH. This limitation will be removed before mainnet availability.\n\nKeep these limitations in mind when working with multi-currency in Verus.\n\n**User:**\nWhy is it not recommended to use i-addresses as names for IDs in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt is not recommended to use i-addresses as names for IDs in Verus because it can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used. This is because an i-address will be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration, rather than the ID with the i-address as its name. To avoid user confusion, the naming system will also be expanded to disallow certain characters for currency registrations.",
