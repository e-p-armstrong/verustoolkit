    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the Verus command line interface on Windows, but I'm having trouble getting the commands to work. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using the native Windows command prompt (`cmd.com`), you need to make some formatting adjustments to get the commands to work correctly. Specifically, you need to:\n\n* Replace the single quote character (`'`) with a double quote character (`\"`)\n* Replace the double quote character (`\"`) with a backslash followed by a double quote character (`\\\"`)\n\nJust keep in mind that this formatting adjustment only applies when giving commands from the Windows command prompt. If you're using Verus Desktop, you can enter commands as listed in the CLI help without making any changes.\n\nDoes that help? Do you have any other questions about using the Verus CLI on Windows?",

            "When using the native Windows command prompt (`cmd.com`), you need to substitute the formatting characters as follows:\n\n* Replace the single quote character (`'`) with a double quote character (`\"`)\n* Replace the double quote character (`\"`) with a backslash followed by a double quote character (`\\\"`)\n\nNote that this formatting adjustment only applies when giving commands from the Windows command prompt.

            "# Remarks on Windows command line formatting: The CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS. On the native windows command prompt (`cmd.com`) the formatting is different. * For windows substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character. * For windows substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters. Note: this only applies to giving commands from the windows command prompt. Verus Desktop will accept commands as listed. Created by Oink.vrsc@ Note: last revision date 2020-03-02.",
