    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the software itself. What kind of warranty or liability does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for clarifying. What kind of permissions are granted to users of the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files, to deal in the software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so. Do you have any questions about that?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. My antivirus software flagged the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThese warnings are likely false positives, indicating that you are installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC.
