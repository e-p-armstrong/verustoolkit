    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm still trying to understand VerusIDs. What's the benefit of the zero-knowledge private addresses in a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe zero-knowledge private addresses in a VerusID can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, providing a private and secure way to interact with various applications and identity policies. They also enable the creation of private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity. This allows for a high level of flexibility and control over your digital identity.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What about VerusHash? What is the purpose of VerusHash 2.0 and VerusHash 2.1?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.0 was designed to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs on the Verus network. VerusHash 2.1 is an adjustment to the equalization technology, intended to slightly favor CPUs while still allowing FPGAs to operate with minor modifications. This helps to create a more balanced and fair environment for all participants on the network.\n\n**User:**\nI see. Before I start using Verus, I want to make sure I understand the terms and conditions. What is the disclaimer for the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and users should be aware that it comes with no warranty or guarantee. Users are free to use, modify, and distribute the software, but they do so at their own risk. The authors and copyright holders are not liable for any damages or liabilities arising from the use of the software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What about the terms of the permission granted to users of the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe permission granted to users of the Verus software allows them to deal with the software without restriction, including the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software. However, the copyright notice and permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. This allows for a high degree of freedom and flexibility in how the software is used and developed.",

            "- **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.# VerusHash 2.1 VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
