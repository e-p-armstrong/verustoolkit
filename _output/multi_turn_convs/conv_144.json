    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey, thanks for the help earlier. I'm interested in creating my own currency in Verus. What happens when I launch a currency, and how can I convert VRSCTEST to the new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you launch a currency, it will start at 50 blocks from when the launch transaction was made (default), and it must have a certain amount of VRSCTEST preconverted at a specified rate in order to launch. After it launches, you can convert VRSCTEST to the new currency using the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will park your conversion until the token launches, and then you will either receive the converted amount of the new currency or have your VRSCTEST back. Do you have any questions about this process or would you like to know more about creating a new currency?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. How can I create a new currency, such as \"mycoin@\", that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a new currency like \"mycoin@\", you can use the `definecurrency` command with a JSON object specifying the currency's properties. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":96, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"conversions\":[0.01, 1.0],\"minpreconversion\":[1000,1000]}'\n```\nThis defines a currency named \"mycoin\" with specific conversion rates, proof protocol, and other properties. You can adjust these properties to fit your needs. Do you have any questions about this process or would you like to know more about the relationship between an ID and a currency?\n\n**User:**\nSpeaking of IDs and currencies, what is the relationship between them in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, to create a currency with a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. This ensures that currency names are unique and controlled by their respective owners.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. One last question: How can I define a currency, such as \"gold@\", with specific properties like conversions and pre-allocation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a currency, you can use the `definecurrency` command with a JSON object specifying the currency's properties. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis defines a currency named \"gold\" with specific conversion rates, pre-allocation, and other properties. You can customize these properties to fit your needs. I hope this helps!",

I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
