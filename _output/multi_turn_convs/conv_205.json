            "Increased number of outbound connections from 4 to 5. Fixed CLI bug displaying 0 mega hashes done when it was hashing just fine. Fixed zfunds calculation on coinsupply RPC Fixed bug preventing Mac builds from mining with the enhancements introduced in v0.5.3Linux and Windows only release, MacOS on the way, Mac users should remain on version 5.1 To upgrade your wallet, run the agama-upgrade script included and enter the directory of your Verus Enhanced Agama app Fixed one not fully portable call in the portable code # IMPORTANT****THIS IS A MANDATORY UPDATE, AND IF YOU DO NOT UPDATE, YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE MAIN VERUS CHAIN AFTER BLOCK 310000.**** # VerusHash 2.0New **VerusHash 2.0**, designed to close the performance gap between CPU, GPU, and FPGA.# Verus Agama ImprovementsFull support of any Komodo asset running natively alongside Verus Coin. This is done by separating out the daemon for Komodo, allowing both the Verus daemon and the Komodo daemon to run simultaneously.https://medium.com/veruscoin/veruscoin-0-5-0-official-release-notes-6d371095dc7a v0.4.0h fixes address indexes for the insight explorer and some APIs, as well as a rare segfault in network reorg edge cases from the cheatcatcher. Version 0.4.0g includes all improvements in 0.4.0f and an expiry on stake transactions to allow deletion from wallets later Version 0.4.0f includes all improvements in 0.4.0e. In addition, it provides more detail about stake (winner of the contest) and mint (staked reward) transactions in Agama GUI as well as CLI listtransactions. It also introduces safeguards against any possibility of double staking behavior caused by forks and reorgs and the ability to set the maximum number of transparent and private transactions in Agama in settings->App config. 0.4.0e fixes issues and introduces a much cleaner view of staking transactions and minted coinbases in the Agama GUI. The following community reported issues are resolved: 1. Coinbase shielding problems to Sapling and sometimes to Sprout private addresses are resolved 2. Staking will again default to sending the coinbase to the address that staked the reward unless **-pubkey=66charpubkey** is set. The public key of an address where you would like the coinbases to go can be determined using **\"validateaddress\"** either in the CLI or GUI. 3. Agama GUI no longer shows ins and outs or multiple lines for a staking transaction. Instead, it now displays an easy to understand single line for each \"stake\" transaction and also easily distinguishes between mined and minted coinbases once they are mature. ## 0.4.0c - released 10/29/2018",
