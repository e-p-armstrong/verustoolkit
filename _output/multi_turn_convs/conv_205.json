    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about some new developments on the Verus Testnet. What are the new parameters available in the `sendcurrency` API on the Verus Testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new parameters available in the `sendcurrency` API on the Verus Testnet are `currency` and `convertto`. The `currency` parameter specifies the source currency of the send (default is \"vrsctest\" on testnet), and the `convertto` parameter allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What is the Verus Testnet multi-currency technology preview?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Testnet multi-currency technology preview is a new feature that allows for the creation of UTXO-based, fractional reserve currencies with anti-front running, simultaneously solved, provably fair liquidity system for all currencies and tokens in or imported into the PBaaS system. It also enhances the `sendcurrency` API with new multi-currency parameters, allowing for conversion between currencies. This is a major development for Verus, and I'm excited to see how it will be used. Do you have any questions about how this technology works?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. What about Verus v0.7.1-2? What's new in that release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus v0.7.1-2 is a non-mandatory release that is compatible with mainnet with no changes from v0.7.1-1. It contains fixes necessary to continue participating in the testnet launched in v0.7.1-1, without reset of your wallet or holdings. It also offers full support for the new Verus Testnet multi-currency technology preview. So, it's a maintenance release that keeps everything running smoothly. Do you have any questions about upgrading to this version?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I was wondering about the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI. What's their purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands are used to verify the signature of a file or a hash, respectively, to ensure that it has not been tampered with during download. They take the signer's identity, the signature, and the file or hash as input, and return `true` if the signature is valid. This is an important security feature to ensure the integrity of your downloads. Do you have any questions about how to use these commands?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. What identity is used to sign Verus downloads?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe identity used to sign Verus downloads is \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". So, when you verify a download, you should see this identity as the signer.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. How do I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the signature. This ensures that your download is genuine and has not been tampered with. Do you have any more questions about Verus or its features?",
