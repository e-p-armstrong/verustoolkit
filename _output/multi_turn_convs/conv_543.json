    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm happy to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to import multiple WIFs in one batch for public (transparent) addresses in Verus Desktop. Do you know how I can do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo import multiple WIFs in one batch for public (transparent) addresses, you'll need to follow these steps. Go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner, and enter the following command for every WIF except for the final one:\n```\nrun importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" false\n```\nThen, import the final WIF with this command:\n```\nrun importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" true\n```\nThe last command triggers the chain to rescan all addresses in your wallet, including all the addresses you just imported. Replace `<wif>` with the actual WIF you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds a bit complicated. Are there any things I should be aware of when doing this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are a few things to keep in mind. Note that the GUI wallet may not show any progress on the import and may give messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting. It will take quite some time for the process to finish in the background, especially if the address has many transactions on it. Just be patient and let the process complete. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
