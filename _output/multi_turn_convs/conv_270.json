    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about some changes to VerusHash. Can you tell me what's new with VerusHash 2.1 compared to VerusHash 2.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which is expected to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I'm wondering, what steps have the Verus developers taken to ensure a smooth transition to VerusHash 2.1 for FPGA manufacturers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll.\n\n**User:**\nYou know, I never really understood the whole point of VerusHash 2.0. What was the primary goal of that algorithm?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe primary goal of the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs on the Verus network, ensuring that FPGAs did not dominate CPU performance.",

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU.
