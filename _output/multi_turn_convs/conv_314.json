    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about VerusIDs. What are the three main features of VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe three main features of VerusIDs are: revocable, recoverable, and private. Each ID includes a revocation authority that can revoke the identity, effectively freezing all of its funds until it is recovered. Each ID also includes a separate recovery authority that can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state. Finally, each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses and a content map of key-value hashes that can be used to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What was the goal of VerusHash 2.0, and how did it achieve it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe goal of VerusHash 2.0 was to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs on the Verus network. It achieved this goal by developing an algorithm that explicitly equalized FPGAs and modern CPUs, keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What are some key features of VerusIDs, and how do they contribute to the security and flexibility of digital identities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs have three key features: revocability, recoverability, and privacy. These features contribute to the security and flexibility of digital identities by allowing for the revocation of an identity in case of key theft, recovery of an identity through redefining its primary state, and the use of zero-knowledge private addresses and content maps for private yet selectively provable claims and attestations.\n\n**User:**\nHow does VerusHash 2.0 algorithm contribute to the Verus network, and what are the goals of its development?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs on the Verus network. Its goal is to prevent FPGAs from dominating CPUs in terms of performance, thereby keeping the cost of FPGA performance under 2x that of CPU performance.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the main difference between VerusHash 2.0 and VerusHash 2.1, and how does it affect the balance between FPGAs and CPUs on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main difference between VerusHash 2.0 and VerusHash 2.1 is an adjustment to the equalization technology in VerusHash 2.1, which is expected to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. This adjustment aims to promote a more balanced performance between FPGAs and CPUs on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of privacy features do VerusIDs provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs provide private zero-knowledge addresses, which can be used for various purposes such as messaging, financial transactions, or voting. They also contain a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and identity policies to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, and selectively provable components of a strong identity.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of VerusHash 2.1, and how does it differ from VerusHash 2.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology of VerusHash 2.0, aiming to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does it mean for a VerusID to be revocable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is revocable, meaning that it includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity itself. This revocation authority has the permission to revoke the identity, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft. Once revoked, the identity cannot be used to spend or sign until it is recovered.",
