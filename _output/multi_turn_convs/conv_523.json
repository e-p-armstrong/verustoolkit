    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm about to update my Verus daemon and I'm not sure what to do. Why should I rename the old versions of the Verus binaries after stopping the daemon?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou should rename the old versions of the Verus binaries to ensure that you can easily revert to the old version if needed. This is done by renaming the files, for example, `mv verus verus-v0.7.3-9` and `mv verusd verusd-v0.7.2-9`. This way, you can always go back to the previous version if something goes wrong with the update.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What should I do after unpacking/unzipping the binaries for the latest version of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter unpacking/unzipping the binaries, you should check if they have been successfully unpacked/unzipped in the directory using the `ls -la` command. This will show you the contents of the directory and ensure that everything is in place.\n\n**User:**\nI have a non-standard directory for my Verus wallet.dat, Chaindata, and VRSC.conf files. What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have a non-standard directory for your Verus files, you should navigate to that directory and check if the `VRSC.conf` file has been overridden during the update. You may need to edit the `VRSC.conf` file to specify the correct `datadir` using a command like `nano VRSC.conf`. Make sure everything is pointing to the right place.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I start the Verus daemon again after updating to the new version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can start the Verus daemon again by running the command `./verusd`. You may also add other start options as needed, which can be found at https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-01_verusd_options.md. This will get the daemon up and running with the new version.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I check the version of Verus after starting the daemon?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can check the version of Verus by running the command `./verus getwalletinfo`. This will show you the version number and confirm that everything is working as expected.\n\n**User:**\nWhat should I do with the older binaries after verifying that the new version is working?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOnce you are satisfied that the new version is working, you can clean up the older binaries by deleting them or moving them to another directory using the `rm` command or the `mv` command, respectively. This will keep your system organized and clutter-free.\n\n**User:**\nLet's go back to the beginning. What is the first step in updating the Verus daemon to a new version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe first step is to STOP the Verus daemon using the command `./verus stop`. This is to ensure that the daemon is not running while you update it.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I check if the Verus daemon has stopped running after issuing the `./verus stop` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can check if the Verus daemon has stopped running by using the `top` command. If the daemon has stopped, `verusd` should not appear in the list of running processes. This will confirm that the daemon is no longer running and you can proceed with the update.",
