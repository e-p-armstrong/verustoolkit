    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey, I'm playing around with creating a currency in Verus, and I was wondering, what's a limitation of using an i-address as the name of an ID when creating a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsing an i-address as the name of an ID when creating a currency in Verus is not recommended because it can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used. This is because an i-address is meant to be calculated based on a name registration, not used as the actual name of an ID. This can lead to user confusion and is not supported for creating currencies. It's best to use a more descriptive and unique name for your ID.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Thanks for the clarification! I'm also exploring PBaaS blockchains in Verus. What information is required to define a PBaaS blockchain in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a PBaaS blockchain in Verus, you need to provide some essential information in a JSON format. Here's a breakdown of what you'll need:\n\nFirst, you'll need to provide the name of the chain, an integer value for the chain options, a list of currencies that the chain's native currency can be converted into, and a list of conversion ratios between the chain's native currency and each currency on the chain.\n\nNext, you'll need to define an array of eras, each with a block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of era. You'll also need to specify a list of VerusIDs that will serve as notaries on the chain, the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block, and an array of nodes, each with a network address and node identity.\n\nAdditionally, you'll need to provide the name of the gateway converter, the initial issuance of the gateway converter, and a separate JSON object for the bridge definition. This bridge definition includes a list of currencies supported by the bridge, an array of initial contributions for each currency, and the initial supply of the bridge's native token.\n\nMake sure to provide all this information in the correct format, and you'll be well on your way to defining a PBaaS blockchain in Verus!",
