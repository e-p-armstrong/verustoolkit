    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've got some questions about using Verus. What kind of warranty or guarantee is provided with this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo warranty or guarantee is provided with this software. It is explicitly stated that \"THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\" Does that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nThat's a bit concerning. What kind of liability do the authors or copyright holders have for any damages or claims arising from the use of this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders have no liability for any claims, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. Their liability is limited in this regard.\n\n**User:**\nI've noticed that some antivirus software flags this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software might flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not actually malicious.\n\n**User:**\nWhere can I find more information about the false positive warnings from antivirus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about the false positive warnings from antivirus software by reviewing the resources provided, such as https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/ and https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/. These resources should help you understand the situation better.",
