    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the block template request. Can you tell me about the structure of the result returned by the block template request?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the block template request is a JSON object with several properties. These properties provide information about the block template, such as the block version, previous block hash, transactions to be included, coinbase transaction, target hash, minimum timestamp, and ways the block template may be changed. Specifically, the properties include \"version\", \"previousblockhash\", \"finalsaplingroothash\", \"transactions\", \"coinbasetxn\", \"target\", \"mintime\", and \"mutable\". Does that help clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nThat does help, thanks! I've also been looking at the \"jsonrequestobject\" and I'm trying to understand the purpose of the \"miningdistribution\" property. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"miningdistribution\" property is a key-value map that determines the distribution of mining rewards. It contains a list of recipient addresses or IDs as keys, and their corresponding relative weights as values. This determines how the mining rewards are distributed among the recipients. In essence, it allows you to specify how the mining rewards should be divided among different parties. Does that make sense?",
