    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help answer any questions you may have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm a bit concerned about the security of Verus executables. Do you have links to VirusTotal for Verus executables on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI completely understand your concern! Yes, we do have links to VirusTotal for Verus executables. Here they are:\n- MacOS: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/a82b8cfb4207b6a8e05300bc91c0363dbad0de7e3f5a1a57043b641ba4852b2e/detection\n- Linux-AMD64: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/1246d439115b7578ddd47f8427a93f3ebad9a637d0735ed1db31003a9a3f53be/detection\n- Windows: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/2ca4b8bef8ad3e23bb896593be1509cf85619f2a6b87e72f9e59b99b52b63810/detection\n\nYou can check them out to see the results for yourself. Do you have any other questions about Verus security?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I've noticed that Avast and Kaspersky sometimes flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Avast and Kaspersky might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because they detect that it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and you can learn more about it from the resources provided. Don't worry, Verus is completely safe to use!\n\n**User:**\nI'm also interested in learning about recent changes to Verus. What are some notable changes in Verus version [insert version number]?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome notable changes in this Verus release include:\n- Enable optional VRSC or VRSCTEST chains as parent of an ID.\n- Update stratum protocol for mining to include solution information for miner, which enables smooth autoswitch and prepares for PBaaS merge mining.\n- Minor issues, including listidentities issue on Mac and compatibility with pool mining, even on block numbers under 16 to prepare for PBaaS.\n- This release includes activation support for VerusID, and relative adjustment to the CPU and FPGA-equalizing VerusHash 2.1 Algorithm.\n\nThese changes should improve your overall experience with Verus. Do you have any other questions about recent updates?\n\n**User:**\nWhat's important to note about the Verus mainnet protocol hardfork?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt is important to note that at block 800200, the Verus mainnet protocol will hardfork, and this update is mandatory to remain on the Verus mainnet. Make sure to upgrade by December 15th, or you may need to resynchronize the blockchain if you are running in native mode. We want to make sure you're prepared for the change!\n\n**User:**\nFinally, can you tell me a bit more about VerusIDs? How do they differ from most blockchain ID implementations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. VerusIDs provide plenty of opportunities for identity applications. They are a unique identifier that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets, offering benefits such as revocability, recoverability, privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses on the Verus worldwide network.",
