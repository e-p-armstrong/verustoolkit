    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've got some questions about the Verus Desktop software. What kind of risks are associated with using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! This software is experimental and unfinished, and it is used at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur as a result of using this software. So, please be aware of that.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. What kind of permissions are granted to users of this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPermission is granted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software without restriction, as long as the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the warranty? Is there any kind of warranty provided with this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What kind of liability do the authors or copyright holders of this software have?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders of this software shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that antivirus software might flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question! Antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky may flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about it.",
