    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand Verus and its features. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning about blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches on Verus. Can you explain how they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches allow for the setting of required minimum levels of worldwide participation in preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimum levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, minus network fees. This ensures that participants are protected in case the minimum participation levels are not met.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! What are some of the additional features available for currency launches on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome additional features available for currency launches on Verus include maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds, pre-launch discounts for early participants, and vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs. These features provide more flexibility and customization options for currency launches.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really powerful. What is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what capabilities does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains within the Verus network. This enables the creation of public blockchains available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that are easy to set up with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's amazing. What is the purpose of Notary IDs in the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. They play a crucial role in facilitating communication and interaction between different blockchains on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about time locks and time delays on Verus. Can you explain how they work and what their purposes are?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTime locks and time delays are features on Verus that allow for the locking and unlocking of IDs. A time lock defines the unlock height of the identity, while a time delay defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. These features can be used to control access to IDs and ensure that they are only unlocked under specific conditions. They add an extra layer of security and flexibility to ID management on Verus.",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.

There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. ## Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**   The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'   ``` - **Time Delay:**   The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-",
