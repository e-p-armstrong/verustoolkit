    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! Are you interested in mining with Verus? I'd be happy to help you get started.\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was thinking of trying pool mining on a Raspberry Pi-like device. What are the requirements for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo engage in pool mining on a Raspberry Pi-like device, you'll need a few specific things. First, your device needs a 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled. Next, you'll need a 64-bit operating system - note that Raspbian, the standard OS for Raspberry Pi, is 32-bit, so you'll need an alternative. You'll also need an ARM release of a mining software like CCMiner or NHEQminer.\n\nIn addition to those requirements, you'll need low latency internet connectivity, a public address to mine to, and a public mining pool to connect to. If you can check all those boxes, you should be good to go! Do you have any questions about setting up pool mining on your Raspberry Pi-like device, or would you like some recommendations for mining software or pools?",
