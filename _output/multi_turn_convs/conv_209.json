    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you with any questions you have about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to list some transactions. What does the `listreceivedbyaddress` command do in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listreceivedbyaddress` command in Verus lists the balances received by each address. It returns a JSON array of objects, each containing information about the address, including the receiving address, the total amount received, and the number of confirmations of the most recent transaction.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. How can I use the `listreceivedbyaddress` command to list all received transactions with at least 6 confirmations, including empty addresses and watchonly addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `listreceivedbyaddress` command with the following syntax:\n```\nverus listreceivedbyaddress 6 true true\n```\nThis will list all received transactions with at least 6 confirmations, including empty addresses and watchonly addresses.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the `listsinceblock` command? What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listsinceblock` command in Verus gets all transactions in blocks since a specified block hash, or all transactions if the block hash is omitted. It takes three parameters: the block hash, the target number of confirmations, and a boolean indicating whether to include watchonly addresses.\n\n**User:**\nI've also seen the `listreceivedbyaccount` command. What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listreceivedbyaccount` command in Verus lists the balances received by each account. It returns a JSON array of objects, each containing information about the account, including the account name, the total amount received, and the number of confirmations of the most recent transaction.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how can I use the `listreceivedbyaccount` command to list all received transactions with at least 6 confirmations, including watchonly addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `listreceivedbyaccount` command with the following syntax:\n```\nverus listreceivedbyaccount 6 true\n```\nThis will list all received transactions with at least 6 confirmations, including watchonly addresses.",
