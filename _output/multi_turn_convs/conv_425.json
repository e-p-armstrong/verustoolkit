    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand Verus. What would you like to know today?\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the key characteristics of a fully decentralized VerusID protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA fully decentralized VerusID protocol has the following characteristics: anyone can create a VerusID without permission, the creator has complete, self-sovereign control over their VerusID, and all costs to create a VerusID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Additionally, VerusIDs are revocable, recoverable, and private. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. What makes VerusIDs private?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are private because each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when available. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI heard about VerusHash 2.0 and VerusHash 2.1. What are they, and how do they differ?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.0 was designed to equalize the performance of FPGAs and modern CPUs, preventing FPGAs from dominating the network. VerusHash 2.1 is an adjustment to this equalization technology, aiming to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. This allows for a more balanced and inclusive mining and staking environment.\n\n**User:**\nYou mentioned that VerusIDs are fully decentralized. What does that mean exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, a fully decentralized protocol means that anyone can create an ID and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without needing permission. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of privacy features do VerusIDs have?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about VerusHash 2.1. How does it compare to VerusHash 2.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 is an updated algorithm that builds upon VerusHash 2.0, which was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which is expected to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does it mean for a VerusID to be revocable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is revocable, meaning that each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity itself. This authority has the permission to revoke the identity, creating a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds. This feature is useful in cases like key theft. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or Verus?",

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network. # Disclaimer",
