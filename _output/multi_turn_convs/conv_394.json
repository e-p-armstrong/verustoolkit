    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was wondering about the license and warranty for this software. What's the deal with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is licensed under a permissive free software license, which grants the user the freedom to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software. However, the software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But I've noticed that some antivirus software flags this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question! The software is flagged as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) by some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, because it is a mining software that can be installed by a third party to exploit the user's PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not malicious. For more information, you can review the resources provided, such as the Malwarebytes blog post on PUP.Optional.BitcoinMiner and the Kaspersky blog post on \"Not-a-virus\".",
