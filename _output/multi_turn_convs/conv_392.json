    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm getting started with Verus Desktop, and I want to make sure I'm doing things right. What's an important step to take before executing a command in Verus Desktop for non-Verus chains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBefore executing a command in Verus Desktop for non-Verus chains, you must select the appropriate coin in the top right corner of the Verus Desktop interface. This ensures that you're working with the correct chain and avoids any potential issues.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I'm also trying to find some directories on my system. Where are the base directories located for Komodo and Komodo asset chains on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe base directories for Komodo are:\n* Linux: `~/.Komodo`\n* Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo`\n\nFor Komodo asset chains, the directory is a folder within the `komodo` base directory, with the official coin designation (e.g., `komodo/PIRATE`). You should be able to find what you're looking for there.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about Zcash? Where are the base directories located for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe base directories for Zcash are:\n* Linux: `~/.Zcash`\n* Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Zcash`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Zcash`\n\nYou should be able to find the Zcash directories in those locations. Let me know if you have any more questions!",
