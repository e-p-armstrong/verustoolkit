    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was thinking about currency launches on Verus. How can they raise funds, and what is the effect on the currency's price?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrency launches on Verus can raise funds in three ways: pre-launch discount, pre-launch carve-out, and pre-allocation. These fundraising options create a currency that is not 100% backed and has a price that responds to market forces. The price of the currency will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it. Do you have any further questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What happens to the fundraising if a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met, no fundraising is received. The funds are simply refunded to the participants.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What's the purpose of a pre-launch discount in a currency launch on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA pre-launch discount in a currency launch on Verus provides a discount to all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block. This is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what's a pre-launch carve-out in a currency launch on Verus, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA pre-launch carve-out in a currency launch on Verus enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price-neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch. This allows the launching identity to receive a portion of the funds raised during the launch.\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing. How does pre-allocation work in a currency launch on Verus, and what is its effect on the reserve ratio?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPre-allocation in a currency launch on Verus enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price-neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time-locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods. This allows for a portion of the newly launched currency to be allocated to specific identities before it's available to the general public.\n\nI hope that answers all your questions about currency launches on Verus! If you have any more, feel free to ask.",

DAI), and can then be sent from Ethereum with simple transactions and received and used as the new \"mapped currency\", or sent back to Ethereum and used there as the original currency. - Currency launches can raise funds in 3 ways. Each of these fundraising options creates a currency that is not 100% backed, and has a price that responds to market forces. 100% backed currencies do not change their relative price to the underlying basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, whether time-locked or not, take their funding from a percentage of the reserve backing. Except in the case of a new blockchain launch, which creates new native currency for operating the proof of stake of the blockchain, any currency that uses fundraising options will be a fractionally backed currency which will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it. If a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options that are not met, no fundraising is received:  - Pre-launch discount - all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency.
