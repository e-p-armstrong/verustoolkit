    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm new to all this, so I'll start with the basics. What is a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides a decentralized identity system. It is not controlled by a corporation and offers various benefits such as quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses, full decentralization, and opportunities for identity applications. Do you have any other questions about VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm curious about using VerusIDs for sending and receiving funds. What are the benefits of using a VerusID for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If the controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. This adds an extra layer of security and flexibility to your transactions. Do you have any other questions about using VerusIDs for sending and receiving funds?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that quantum computers might be a threat to some crypto systems. Are VerusIDs resistant to quantum attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, a quantum secure signature scheme is being integrated and is expected to be activated on mainnet soon. This will allow for retroactive quantum resistance of funds sent to an ID. So, you can rest assured that your VerusID is secure against quantum attacks.\n\n**User:**\nYou mentioned that VerusIDs are fully decentralized. What does that mean exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are fully decentralized, meaning anyone can create one and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. This means that you have full control over your identity and data, and you don't need to rely on a central authority to manage it. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great. What are some of the features of VerusIDs that make them secure?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs have several features that make them secure, including being revocable and recoverable. Each ID includes a revocation authority and a separate recovery authority, which can be used to revoke or recover the identity in case of key theft or turnover in an organization. This adds an extra layer of security and flexibility to your identity management. Do you have any other questions about VerusIDs or their security features?",
