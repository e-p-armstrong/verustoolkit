    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been thinking about VerusIDs, and I want to know more about their privacy features. What is meant by \"private\" in the context of VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the context of VerusIDs, \"private\" refers to the fact that each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses. These private addresses can be used as endpoints for various purposes such as messaging, financial transactions, or voting. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, which can be used to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity, once quantum secure signatures are available.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also heard that VerusIDs can have multiple primary addresses associated with them. What are the benefits of having multiple primary addresses associated with a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nHaving multiple primary addresses associated with a VerusID makes it \"powerful\" because it allows for more flexibility and control over the identity. Specifically, any number of primary addresses can be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity, which is known as an N of M multisig control. This means that multiple parties can be involved in the decision-making process, and a certain number of them must agree before any changes can be made. Furthermore, the revocation authority and recovery authority can also be set up with their own N of M multisig controls, adding an extra layer of security and control. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or their features?",
