    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nBefore I start using this software, I'd like to know the disclaimer.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood thinking! Yes, it's essential to understand the terms of using this software. Here's the disclaimer: This software is experimental and unfinished. Use at your own risk! No warranty for any kind of damage! The software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE and NONINFRINGEMENT. Please keep this in mind as you use the software.\n\n**User:**\nAlright, got it. I've been using VRSCTEST from a previous version, and I just updated to this new version. Is there anything I need to do before running this new update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSince you've updated from a previous version, it's a good idea to clean up some directories to ensure a smooth transition. If you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this new update, you should delete the following directories before running this new update:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nThis will help prevent any conflicts or issues with the new update. Do you have any other questions about the update or Verus in general?",
