    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to set up coin mining using the Verus command line. How do I set the number of threads for coin mining?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can set the number of threads for coin mining using the `-genproclimit` option followed by the number of threads you want to use. For example, `-genproclimit=4` would set the number of threads to 4. If you want to use all available cores, you can set it to `-1`.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I'm also curious about PBaaS options in Verus. What are they?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe PBaaS options available in Verus include:\n\n* `-acceptfreeimportsfrom`: accepts underpaid imports from specific PBaaS chains or networks\n* `-allowdelayednotarizations`: allows delayed notarizations to prevent slowing down the network\n* `-alwayssubmitnotarizations`: submits notarizations to the notary chain whenever eligible\n* `-approvecontractupgrade`: votes to agree to upgrade to a specific contract\n* `-blocktime`: sets the target block time for difficulty adjustment\n* `-chain`: loads either the mainnet or a specific PBaaS chain\n* `-miningdistributionpassthrough`: uses the same mining distribution values and addresses/IDs as Verus when merge mining\n* `-notarizationperiod`: sets the minimum spacing consensus between cross-chain notarization\n* `-notaryid`: specifies the VerusID used for PBaaS and Ethereum cross-chain notarization\n* `-notificationoracle`: specifies the VerusID monitored for network alerts, triggers, and signals\n* `-powaveragingwindow`: sets the averaging window for PoW difficulty adjustment\n* `-testnet`: loads the PBaaS network in test mode\n\nDo you have any specific questions about these options or would you like me to explain any of them in more detail?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I have another question. How do I specify a specific address to receive mined coins using the Verus command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can specify a specific address to receive mined coins using the `-mineraddress` option followed by the address. For example, `-mineraddress=mike@` would send mined coins to the address `mike@`.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. What is the purpose of the `-minetolocalwallet` option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-minetolocalwallet` option requires that mined blocks use a coinbase address in the local wallet. This option is enabled by default.",
