    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey! I was wondering, what is the result of a successful verification using the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the signature is valid, the result of the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command will be `true`. That's a simple but important one!\n\n**User:**\nGot it! I'm also curious about the v0.7.2-4 upgrade of the Verus CLI. What new features are included in this upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.7.2-4 upgrade of the Verus CLI includes some exciting new features. These include: friendly-name private z-address support for sending and receiving funds and messages; `sendcurrency` can now use sapling addresses as native currency funding sources and destinations for any transaction; an identity's z-address can now be referenced as a funding source or destination by appending `:private` to an ID; new wildcards can be used as funds sources in the `sendcurrency` command and parameters to `z_getbalance`; and `sendcurrency` is now an asynchronous API that returns an operation ID and completes in the background, with its status available through `z_getoperationstatus`. That's a lot of new functionality!\n\n**User:**\nI'm also concerned about the integrity of the Verus package I downloaded. How can I verify it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the integrity of a downloaded Verus package, you need to follow these steps: extract the downloaded archive; and then verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. The package has been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". You can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command in the Verus CLI to verify the signature.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a plan. Can you walk me through using the `verifyfile` command to verify the signature of a downloaded package?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `verifyfile` command to verify the signature of a downloaded package as follows:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <path_to_file>\n```\nReplace `<path_to_file>` with the path to the downloaded package file. This will verify the signature and let you know if it's valid.",
