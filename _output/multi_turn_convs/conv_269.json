    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to distinguish between staked and mined coins using the Verus CLI. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo distinguish between staked and mined coins using the Verus CLI, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Use the `listtransactions` command to check the last 10 transactions.\n2. Copy the blockhash of the received award.\n3. Add the blockhash to the end of `https://explorer.verus.io/api/getblock?` to check if the coin is minted or mined.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to determine if a coin is staked or mined using the Verus CLI. Do you have any other questions about this process or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, but I'm also interested in doing this using Verus Desktop. How can I check if a coin is staked or mined using Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus Desktop, you can check if a coin is staked or mined by:\n\n1. Going to the Mining Dashboard.\n2. Entering Verus details.\n3. Scrolling down to the bottom of the page, where rewards are listed as `mined` or `minted` in green, and TXIDs that staked the minted rewards are shown in blue.\n\nVerus Desktop makes it easy to check the status of your coins. Do you have any other questions about using Verus Desktop or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nI've also been using the VerusExplorer to check the status of my coins. What is the purpose of the VerusExplorer in determining if a coin is staked or mined?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusExplorer, accessible at `https://explorer.verus.io/`, is a tool that helps determine if a coin is staked or mined by providing information about the blockhash of a transaction. By adding the blockhash to the end of `https://explorer.verus.io/api/getblock?`, you can check if the coin is minted or mined. The VerusExplorer is a valuable resource for getting detailed information about transactions and blocks on the Verus network. Do you have any other questions about the VerusExplorer or Verus in general?",
