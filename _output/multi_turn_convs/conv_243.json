What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the safety of the Verus software. Where can I find the VirusTotal detection results for the Verus software on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find the VirusTotal detection results for the Verus software on different operating systems at the following links: MacOS: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/3a04de7202aff21afb8005d462b9d5acf577bae8705ec308de56c720f40841d5/detection, Linux: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/3351d8fd49ac074605d776f147c0906d149ac936418512c1940465f233d8f9c0/detection, and Windows: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/d1bdee20f375dad722b71851f69588062cd9e3760ed653957096080de9d0b3d0/detection.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks.

You are granted permission to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, but the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the notable changes in Verus version [insert version number]?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the notable changes in this release of Verus include: renaming komodod and komodo-cli to verusd and verus, and removing wrappers. Minor staking improvements. Fixing longest chain reporting. Fixing getchaintips bug. Preparations for PBaaS.\n\n**User:**\nWhat should I do if I want to participate in the PBaaS testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo participate in the PBaaS testnet, you should use the [PBaaS Cross-chain Technology Preview](https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.6.0.12-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview) release, which is specifically designed for this purpose.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. Why do some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it detects the presence of mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about these false positives.",
