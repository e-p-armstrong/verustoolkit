    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI have a question about creating currencies from IDs. What is a limitation of creating a currency from an ID that has an i-address as its actual name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne limitation is that you will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But why is it not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt is not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name because it will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (in many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What about creating PBaaS chains? What is a limitation of creating a PBaaS chain with a currency name that is already supported in the Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the GUI, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the Verus Desktop itself? What kind of software is it, and what kind of risk does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Desktop is experimental and unfinished software. It comes with a warning to \"use at your own risk!\" and \"no warranty for any kind of damage!\" It is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.",
