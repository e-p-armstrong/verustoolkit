    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI have some questions about transactions in Verus. What is the default minimum confirmation requirement for transactions included in the `z_gettotalbalance` result?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default minimum confirmation requirement for transactions included in the `z_gettotalbalance` result is 1 block confirmation. Do you have any further questions about transactions or balances in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nI was also wondering about the `z_getoperationstatus` command. What is the purpose of this command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getoperationstatus` command is used to get the status of a specific operation, along with any associated result or error data. This command allows you to monitor the progress of an operation and retrieve any relevant information. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the `z_getoperationstatus` command?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually. How do you use the `z_getoperationstatus` command to retrieve the status of all operations known to the node?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo retrieve the status of all operations known to the node, you can use the `z_getoperationstatus` command without providing an \"operationid\" argument. This will return a list of JSON objects, each containing the status and any associated data for each operation. Do you have any more questions about using the `z_getoperationstatus` command or operations in Verus?",
