    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI've been using VRSCTEST for a while now, but I just updated to the latest version. What should I do if I have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release, you should delete the following directories before running this new update:\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\nThis will ensure a smooth transition to the new version. Do you have any other questions about the update?\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of software is this release, anyway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! This release is experimental and unfinished software. It is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, and NONINFRINGEMENT. Use at your own risk! Keep in mind that this is still under development, so be cautious when using it.\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of permissions do I have as a user of this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files, to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the conditions stated in the disclaimer. You have quite a bit of freedom to use and customize the software as you see fit.\n\n**User:**\nI've noticed that some antivirus software flags this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can learn more about it from the resources provided. Don't worry, it's just a misunderstanding on the part of the antivirus software!",
