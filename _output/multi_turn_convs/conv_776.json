    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been using the testnet with versions prior to v0.9.2. Is there anything I should know?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have already used testnet with versions prior to v0.9.2, make sure to delete and clear any existing testnet data folders as described in the release notes. This will ensure a smooth transition to the new version.\n\n**User:**\nWhat can I expect from the new Verus testnet? Is it suitable for development-capable projects?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll PBaaS capabilities, including for application development, are available now on the new Verus testnet. It is recommended that development-capable projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus's transformative technologies do a deep dive on the Verus testnet.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the v0.9.3 release, and what's next for the core developers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.9.3 release is a protocol release candidate RC1 for the coming mainnet upgrade. The core developer focus now remains on protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets, as well as merge mining for pool servers.\n\n**User:**\nI heard the Verus website has been updated. What changes have been made to support Metamask and Ethereum integration?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new website for Metamask support and use from Ethereum now displays all mapped currency options, including those added when someone exports a currency definition to Ethereum, either as a mapped currency or for using any Verus or PBaaS currency as an ERC20.\n\n**User:**\nWhat new feature is being launched as part of the Verus release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Ethereum bridge is being launched, which enables full use of Ethereum mapped currencies on the Goerli Ethereum testnet. This makes it easy for any currency definition to become a fully decentralized, auditable stable coin by mapping to DAI, USDT, USDC, or another stable coin on Ethereum.",
