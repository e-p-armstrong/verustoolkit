    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the Verus Desktop wallet, but I'm not sure how to enter commands. Can you help me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen entering commands in the Verus Desktop wallet, you need to enter `verus command \"<userinput>\"` literally, replacing `<userinput>` with your specific userdata. For example, if the text directs you to use `\"<Public Address>\"`, you would replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the actual address, so it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that helps. Now, I'm trying to convert a seed phrase into a Private key (WIF). What are the prerequisites for doing that in Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert your seed phrase into a Private key (WIF), you need to have a running native wallet first, that is fully synchronized. The earliest wallet that supports these functions is **Verus Desktop v0.6.4-beta-1**. Additionally, you may need to use a guide to quickly synchronize your wallet if needed. Are you using the correct version of the wallet?\n\n**User:**\nI think so. Now, how do I actually convert my seed phrase into a Private key (WIF) in Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert your seed phrase into a Private key (WIF), go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner and enter the following command: `run convertpassphrase \"word_1 word_2 word_3... word_n\"`. Replace `Word1 word2 word3... word_n` with the actual seedphrase (12 or 24 words) of the address you want to import. This will give you a response containing the Private key (WIF) among other information. Have you tried that?\n\n**User:**\nThat worked! Now, I want to import a single WIF for a public (transparent) address in Verus Desktop. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo import your address, go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner and enter the following command: `run importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" true`. Replace `<wif>` with the actual **wif** you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier. That should do it!",
