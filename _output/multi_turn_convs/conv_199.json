    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus and the VerusPay API. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get the current price of VRSC in CAD fiat using the VerusPay API. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get the current price of VRSC in CAD fiat by using the following URL: `https://veruspay.io/api/?currency=cad`. Just send a GET request to that URL, and you'll get the current price in CAD.\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I don't specify any options? What's the default value returned by the VerusPay API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't specify any options, the default value returned by the VerusPay API is the average price of VRSC in USD fiat, weighted against 24-hour volume across all exchanges.\n\n**User:**\nCan I use the VerusPay API to get the price of a different coin, such as ARRR?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use the VerusPay API to get the price of a different coin, such as ARRR. Just specify the ticker symbol in the URL, like this: `https://veruspay.io/api/?currency=cad&ticker=arrr`. This will return the average price of ARRR in CAD fiat.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I get the 24-hour volume of VRSC on CryptoBridge using the VerusPay API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get the 24-hour volume of VRSC on CryptoBridge by using the following URL: `https://veruspay.io/api/?exch=cryptobridge&data=volume`. This will return the volume in USD fiat. If you want the volume in BTC, you can add `&currency=btc` to the URL: `https://veruspay.io/api/?exch=cryptobridge&data=volume&currency=btc`.\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I want to get the current price of VRSC in BTC instead?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get the current price of VRSC in BTC by using the following URL: `https://veruspay.io/api/?currency=btc`. Just send a GET request to that URL, and you'll get the current price in BTC.",
