    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the Verus Desktop software. What's the status of it, and are there any risks involved in using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Desktop software is currently experimental and unfinished. It comes with no warranty, which means use of the software is at your own risk, and you may be liable for any damages or losses incurred. Please keep that in mind when deciding whether to use the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What are the terms and conditions of using the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided under a permissive license, which allows you to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software without restriction. However, the enclosed copyright notice and permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. It's pretty standard stuff, but I'm happy to clarify if you have any further questions!\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of warranty does the software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software comes with no warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Again, it's experimental, so use it at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What if my antivirus software flags the software as malicious? Should I be worried?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question! If your antivirus software flags the software as malicious, it may be a false positive. Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program) because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. You can research online to learn more about these false positives. It's always a good idea to do your due diligence when it comes to antivirus warnings!",
