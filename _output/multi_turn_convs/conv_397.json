    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nYeah, so I've been messing around with some Verus commands, and I was wondering about the `getblockcount` method. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblockcount` method returns the number of blocks in the best valid block chain. It's a simple but useful command for getting an idea of the current state of the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I use the `getblockcount` method to get the current block count?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getblockcount` method by running the command `verus getblockcount` in the command line, or by sending a JSON-RPC request to the Verus daemon. The JSON-RPC request would look like this:\n```bash\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getblockcount\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nJust replace `myusername` with your actual username, and you're good to go!\n\n**User:**\nCool, thanks for that. I've also seen the `getblockdeltas` method mentioned. What's that all about?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblockdeltas` method returns information about a given block and its transactions. However, it's disabled by default, so you'll need to enable it first. To do that, you can restart verusd with the `-experimentalfeatures` and `-insightexplorer` command-line options, or add the following lines to the `VRSC.conf` file:\n```\nexperimentalfeatures=1\ninsightexplorer=1\n```\nOnce you've enabled it, you can use `getblockdeltas` by passing a block hash as an argument, like this: `getblockdeltas '[\"blockhash\"]'`. Just replace `blockhash` with the actual hash of the block you're interested in.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",
