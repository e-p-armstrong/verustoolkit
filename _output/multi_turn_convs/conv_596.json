    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with VerusIDs and currencies, and I was wondering, are there any limitations to creating a currency from an ID in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address as a currency name will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also trying to create a currency in the GUI, and I ran into another issue. What's the limitation there?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the GUI, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification. I've seen some warnings and disclaimers when using Verus software. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer states that the software is experimental and unfinished, and should be used at your own risk.
