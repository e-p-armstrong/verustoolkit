    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm a bit worried about something. What happens if I accidentally send funds to a b-address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you accidentally send funds to a b-address, those funds will get locked in the same manner as the original coinbase reward was. However, because they were not sent using a script to lock those coins, they can be retrieved without waiting the full unlock period (typically between 3 and 27 months).\n\n**User:**\nThat's a relief! But how can I retrieve those funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo retrieve funds sent to a b-address, you need to follow a specific procedure. First, you need to determine the TXID of the locked funds. You can do this by obtaining the TXID from the send transaction in Verus-Desktop, looking up the b-address on the explorer, or using the `listunspent` command in Verus Desktop. Once you have the TXID, you can create a raw transaction to retrieve the funds.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I determine the TXID of the locked funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can determine the TXID of the locked funds in three ways: Obtain the TXID from the send transaction in Verus-Desktop, look up the b-address on the explorer and examine the transactions to this address (the youngest transaction is usually the one you need), or in Verus Desktop, go to `Settings` -> `Coin Settings` and make sure `VRSC` is selected in the top right. Run the command: `run listunspent 0 <BLOCKCOUNT> '[\"<YOUR-b-ADDRESS>\"]'`. Replace `<BLOCKCOUNT>` with the current blockcount your wallet is on and `<YOUR-b-ADDRESS>` with the actual b-address where the coins are.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how do I create a raw transaction to retrieve the funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a raw transaction, you need to use the CLI-interface. In Verus Desktop, run the command: `run createrawtransaction '[{\"txid\": \"yourtxid here\", \"vout\": fill in too}]' \"{\"destination addr\": <amount>}\" <current Blockheight -5>`. Replace `\"yourtxid here\"` with the actual TXID of the locked funds, `\"vout\"` with the corresponding vout value, `\"destination addr\"` with the address you want to send the funds to, `<amount>` with the amount you want to send, and `<current Blockheight -5>` with the current block height minus 5.\n\nDo you have any more questions about retrieving funds from a b-address?",

The easiest way is to obtain the TXID from the send transaction you did in Verus-Desktop to the b-address. Make a copy of the TXID: you will need it for this procedure 2. The next easiest way is look up the b-address on the [explorer](https://explorer.verus.io) and examine the transactions to this address. The youngest transaction is usually the one you need. On the explorer the hash in the transaction is the TXID. Make a copy of the TXID: you will need it for this procedure 3.

Replace `<YOUR-b-ADDRESS` with the actual b-address where the coins are.
