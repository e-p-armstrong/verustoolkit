    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm testing out the Verus Desktop testnet release, and I was wondering about PBaaS chains. What's a limitation of using PBaaS chains in the current release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the current Verus Desktop testnet release, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification. I also had a question about the warranty or liability provided with the Verus software. What's the deal with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I did notice that my antivirus software was flagging the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and the software is safe to use.",
