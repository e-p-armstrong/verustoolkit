    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about digital signatures using Verus CLI. What is the result of a valid digital signature using Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of a valid digital signature using Verus CLI is actually quite simple: `true`. That's the confirmation you'll get when a digital signature is valid.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! What makes Verus digital signatures different from those offered by Bitcoin and its derivatives?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus digital signatures offer more advanced capabilities than those offered by Bitcoin and its derivatives. They include friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity. Additionally, Verus digital signatures provide full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft. So, it's a much more robust and feature-rich system.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds impressive. What are some potential use cases for Verus digital signatures?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome potential use cases for Verus digital signatures include journalists signing photos, videos, and content to establish a reputation for authenticity and counter deep-fakes; open source projects creating their own identities and digitally signing their binary releases; attestations of one party to the validity of another; physical entry systems; workflow applications; and even new earning opportunities. The possibilities are vast!\n\n**User:**\nI see. What is the foundation upon which Verus digital signatures are built?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus digital signatures are built upon the Verus ID protocol. This foundation provides a robust and secure basis for the digital signatures, allowing them to offer the advanced capabilities and features that set them apart from other digital signature systems. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about Verus digital signatures?",

Verus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer the first worldwide verifiable, decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft.Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables. It is also the foundation upon which many new applications and additional capabilities can be built.For example, using Verus ID signatures, it\u2019s possible for any journalist anywhere to sign photos, videos, and content, establish a reputation for authenticity, and counter the potential for deep-fakes to make the truth harder to find. Open source projects can now create their own identities and digitally sign their binary releases, ensuring that not only can a file be verified by hash as the one downloaded from a particular server, but by signature as the actual file initially signed by the developer or release engineer. Signatures also form the basis for any attestation of one party to the validity of another. In fact, there are so many applications for digital signatures, from things listed already, to physical entry systems, to workflow applications, to new earning opportunities that a full discussion of use cases would overwhelm these release notes.In any case, we are happy to release digital signatures for all, and we hope you enjoy using this new, simple capability, maybe even think of a new use case you\u2019d like to pursue yourself as a business opportunity on the Verus Network!",
