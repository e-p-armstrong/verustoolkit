    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've got a question about immature blocks. How can I determine when an immature block will \"unlock\" (mature) in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use a script to automate the process and estimate the time when an immature block will mature. The script calculates the estimated time for each block based on the number of blocks remaining and the current block height. Would you like me to explain more about the script?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, that would be helpful. What is the importance of the `verus_path` and `verus_cli` variables in the script?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verus_path` and `verus_cli` variables are used to specify the path to the Verus CLI executable and the name of the executable itself. You need to set these variables to the correct values for your system in order to run the script successfully. This ensures that the script can find and interact with the Verus CLI to get the necessary information.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What conditions need to be met in order to run a Verus-related script successfully?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo run a Verus-related script successfully, you need to have the Verus daemon running and you need to enter the correct path to your Verus directory in the script. This allows the script to interact with the Verus daemon and access the necessary information.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. How does the script estimate the time when an immature block will mature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe script estimates the time when an immature block will mature by calculating the number of days until maturity based on the number of blocks remaining until maturity and the average number of blocks per day (1440). It then converts this to a date using the `date` command. Note that the actual number of blocks per day may vary, so the estimated dates may change slightly over time.",
