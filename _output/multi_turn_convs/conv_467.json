    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating a multi-currency PBaaS chain, but I'm not sure about the limitations. Can you tell me more?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCreating a multi-currency PBaaS chain is an exciting project, but there are a couple of limitations to be aware of. First, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n\nSecond, in the GUI, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for the testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.\n\nDo you have any other questions about creating a multi-currency PBaaS chain?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What are the components of a PBaaS blockchain definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA PBaaS blockchain definition consists of several components. Let me break them down for you:\n\n1. `name`: The name of the PBaaS chain.\n2. `options`: An integer that defines various properties of the chain.\n3. `currencies`: An array of currencies that can be converted to the chain's native currency.\n4. `conversions`: An array of conversion ratios between the chain's native currency and each currency on the chain.\n5. `eras`: An array of objects defining the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each era in the chain's lifecycle.\n6. `notaries`: An array of VerusIDs that serve as notaries on the chain.\n7. `minnotariesconfirm`: An integer that specifies the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block.\n8. `nodes`: An array of objects describing the network addresses and IDs of the nodes on the chain.\n9. `gatewayconvertername`: The name of the bridge converter.\n10. `gatewayconverterissuance`: The initial issuance of the bridge converter's native token.\n\nThese components work together to define the structure and functionality of your PBaaS chain. Do you have any questions about any of these components?",
