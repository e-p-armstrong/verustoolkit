    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI heard about the v0.9.9 release of Verus and its significance in bridging blockchain networks. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.9.9 release of Verus is indeed a significant milestone. It's the first release of any blockchain protocol that enables cryptographically provable, cross-chain bridging across Verus and all PBaaS and other connected blockchains in the network, with or without the need for notary witnesses. This is a major step forward in interoperability and usability.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds impressive. I'd like to know more about the auto-notarization technology in Verus. How does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe auto-notarization technology in Verus works by using cryptographic evidence to ensure that cross-chain transactions are secure and difficult to manipulate. It can be thought of as \"Proof of Proof of Power\" because it relies on cryptographic proof and challenge resolution between merge miners and stakers. This technology allows for cross-chain transactions to complete even without notary witnesses, although it may be slower.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what's the role of notary witnesses in the cross-chain bridging technology of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary witnesses are used to speed up cross-chain transactions in Verus. When they are operational, transactions complete faster. However, even if they stop witnessing for any reason, the protocol will fail-over to auto-notarization, ensuring that cross-chain transactions still function as expected.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. How can a chain launch specify notary witnesses in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA chain launch in Verus can specify notary witnesses by using the `\u201cnotarizationprotocol\u201d:1` option, which is also the default. This allows the chain to use notary witnesses when they are operational, and fail-over to auto-notarization if they stop witnessing.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the current recommendation for launching serious PBaaS chains in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe current recommendation is to launch serious PBaaS chains with operational notary witnesses until further notice, as the auto-notarization technology has not yet been proven to an academic standard. This ensures the highest level of security and reliability for your chain.",

            "The v0.9.9 release of Verus is the first release of any blockchain protocol that enables cryptographically provable, cross-chain bridging across Verus and all PBaaS and other connected blockchains in the network, with or without the need for notary witnesses.",
            "4. **Bridging Blockchain Networks Without Witnesses**: v0.9.9 is the first release of any blockchain protocol anywhere that we know of which enables cryptographically provable, cross-chain bridging across Verus and all PBaaS and other connected blockchains in the network, either combined with or independent of the need for notary witnesses. With notary witnesses, cross-chain transactions complete faster, but they are also checked against cryptographic evidence, making it difficult to impossible for anyone, including notary witnesses to take any action, even colluding with validators that would go against the wishes of the most chain power. We have been referring to this new cross-chain consensus technology as \u201cauto-notarization\u201d, as that is what it actually is, but it would also be accurate to call it Proof of Proof of Power, as that is how it works. For purposes of ensuring everyone understands the state of the technology, it is fully functional and we have taken great care to ensure it is sufficiently secure, but we have not yet had the protocol proven to an academic standard. Because of that, while it provides a security fall-back against misbehaving notary witnesses and will be fully functional and we believe sufficiently secure without notary witnesses on release, we currently recommend toconsider the protocol unproven at this time and that any serious PBaaS chains be launched with operational notary witnesses until further notice.Using `\u201cnotarizationprotocol\u201d:1`, which is also the default, a chain launch can specify notary witnesses that will be used when they do their job. Even if they stop witnessing for any reason, the protocol will fail-over to auto-notarization, ensuring that cross-chain transactions still function as expected, even if just for people to move their assets to another blockchain, although significantly more slowly and based solely on cryptographic proof and challenge resolution between merge miners and stakers. This cross-chain proof and challenge protocol operates even when witnesses are also operating and if miners and stakers continue to prove a more powerful chain than the one witnesses represent, the most powerful chain can still be confirmed. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**",
