    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been using Verus for a while now, but I have some concerns about the software itself. What kind of warranty or liability does the software provider offer for the use of this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I did run into an issue with my antivirus software, though. It flagged the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf your antivirus software flags the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", it is likely a false positive warning. These warnings are triggered because the software is related to cryptocurrency mining, which can be exploited by third parties to harm your PC. You can review the resources provided to learn more about these false positives and understand that they do not necessarily indicate a malicious software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But where can I find the detection results for the Verus software on different platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find the detection results for the Verus software on different platforms on VirusTotal, a website that analyzes files for viruses and malware. The links to the detection results are provided for MacOS, Linux-AMD64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows. You can check them out to see the results for yourself.",
