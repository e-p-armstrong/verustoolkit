    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some of the options when running Verus. What's the purpose of the `-maxconnections` option, and what's the default value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-maxconnections` option specifies the maximum number of connections to peers that Verus will maintain. The default value is 384. This option allows you to control how many connections Verus establishes with other nodes in the network, which can affect performance and resource usage.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the `-onion` option? How does it differ from the `-proxy` option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-onion` option allows Verus to use a separate SOCKS5 proxy to reach peers via Tor hidden services. This is different from the `-proxy` option, which connects through a SOCKS5 proxy, but does not necessarily use Tor hidden services. The `-onion` option is specifically designed to work with Tor's hidden services, providing an additional layer of privacy and anonymity when connecting to the Verus network. Do you have any more questions about Verus or its options?",
