    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to verify the Verus software on different operating systems. Can you provide me with the links to VirusTotal for the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe links to VirusTotal for the Verus software are:\n- MacOS: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/e1884e04a3d5932b99e3bfcb8a34cd3ed4034340367a5fade0b831eda6a0daa2/detection\n- Linux-AMD64: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/b514dbcf8ae804efe16ea5080751e3c0e6702a6db59b38eb7994c9a5fdc81c4c/detection\n- Windows: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/b5fb64cad0bb29ab76b0215b7050beee2919bcb1b6eef6bd52436d665fa3a051/detection\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nI noticed that Avast and Kaspersky are flagging the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAvast and Kaspersky might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a warning, not a detection of malware. Don't worry, Verus is safe to use!\n\n**User:**\nWhat significant update was made to the Verus mainnet protocol at block 800200?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAt block 800200, the Verus mainnet protocol was updated to include VerusID.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are VerusIDs, and how do they differ from other blockchain ID implementations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. VerusIDs provide opportunities for identity applications and offer features like quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses, fully decentralized protocol, and more.",
