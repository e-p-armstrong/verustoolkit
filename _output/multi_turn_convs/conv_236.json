    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `zcrawjoinsplit` command, but I'm not sure what the output format is. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe output format of the `zcrawjoinsplit` command is a JSON object containing three properties: `\"encryptednote1\"`, `\"encryptednote2\"`, and `\"rawtxn\"`. Specifically, the output looks like this:\n```json\n{\n  \"encryptednote1\": enc1,\n  \"encryptednote2\": enc2,\n  \"rawtxn\": rawtxout\n}\n```\nDoes that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! But I'm still a bit unclear on what the `zcrawjoinsplit` command is actually doing. Can you explain its purpose and what the inputs and outputs are?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `zcrawjoinsplit` command splices a joinsplit into a raw transaction. The inputs are:\n\n* `inputs`: a JSON object mapping `{note: zcsecretkey,...}`\n* `outputs`: a JSON object mapping `{zcaddr: value,...}`\n* `vpub_old`: a globally public value\n* `vpub_new`: a globally public value\n\nThe outputs are confidential between the sender and receiver, and the caller is responsible for delivering the output `enc1` and `enc2` to the appropriate recipients, as well as signing `rawtxout` and ensuring it is mined.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about `zcrawjoinsplit` or Verus in general!",
