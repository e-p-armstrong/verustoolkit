    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand the `listunspent` command. Can you tell me what information each object in the `listunspent` command contains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach object in the `listunspent` command contains the following information:\n\n1. `txid`: The transaction id\n2. `vout`: The output index\n3. `scriptPubKey`: The script public key\n4. `amount`: The amount of the transaction\n5. `confirmations`: The number of confirmations\n\nDoes that help clarify things? Do you have any further questions about `listunspent`?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that makes sense. But what's the purpose of the `listunspent` command in the first place?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listunspent` command returns an array of unspent transaction outputs with between `minconf` and `maxconf` (inclusive) confirmations. Optionally, it can filter to only include txouts paid to specified addresses. It's a useful tool for getting information about available transaction outputs.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. Now, let's say I want to list transactions 100 to 120 using the command line. How would I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can list transactions 100 to 120 by running the following command:\n```\nverus listtransactions \"*\" 20 100\n```\nThis will show you the transactions in that range.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what if I want to list the most recent 10 transactions in the system using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEasy one! You can list the most recent 10 transactions in the system by running the following command:\n```\nverus listtransactions\n```\nThis will show you the latest transactions.",
