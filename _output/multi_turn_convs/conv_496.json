    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm wondering about the problems that Verus ID is trying to solve. What is a fundamental issue in blockchain systems today that Verus ID aims to solve?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne fundamental issue in blockchain systems today is the trade-off between decentralized, censorship-resistant public systems and the risk to your cryptocurrency assets. This trade-off has been considered an acceptable price for having full control over your own funds and blockchain assets. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that makes sense. So, what is the fundamental issue in blockchain systems today that Verus ID aims to address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe fundamental issue is the trade-off between decentralized, censorship-resistant public systems and the risk to one's cryptocurrency assets. This trade-off is considered an acceptable price to pay for having full control over one's own funds and blockchain assets.\n\n**User:**\nSo, how does Verus ID provide a solution to this fundamental issue?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus ID provides an elegant solution to previously unsolved, fundamental problems by offering quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. What advantages do Verus IDs have over today's blockchain systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs have the following advantages over today's blockchain systems: they are self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable identities, which provide a higher level of control and security for users. Do you have any more questions about Verus ID or how it solves these fundamental issues?",
