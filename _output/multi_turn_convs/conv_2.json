    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHi! I'm trying to get a better understanding of Verus. What information does the `getpeerinfo` command provide about connected peers in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getpeerinfo` command is a great tool for getting information about connected peers. It provides detailed information, including:\n\n* Peer index (`id`)\n* IP address and port (`addr`)\n* Local address (`addrlocal`)\n* Services offered (`services`)\n* Time of last send and receive (`lastsend` and `lastrecv`)\n* Total bytes sent and received (`bytessent` and `bytesrecv`)\n* Connection time (`conntime`)\n* Time offset (`timeoffset`)\n* Ping time and wait (`pingtime` and `pingwait`)\n* Peer version and string version (`version` and `subver`)\n* Inbound or outbound connection (`inbound`)\n* Starting block height (`startingheight`)\n* Ban score (`banscore`)\n* Last common header and block (`synced_headers` and `synced_blocks`)\n* Heights of blocks currently being asked from the peer (`inflight`)\n\nThis command can be really helpful for debugging and understanding how your node is interacting with other nodes on the network. Do you have any other questions about `getpeerinfo` or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for explaining that! I've also been wondering about the `ping` command. What is the purpose of the `ping` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `ping` command is a simple but useful tool. It's used to measure ping time by sending a ping to all other nodes. The results are provided in the `getpeerinfo` command, specifically in the `pingtime` and `pingwait` fields, which are measured in decimal seconds. The `ping` command is handled in a queue with all other commands, so it measures processing backlog, not just network ping. This can help you understand how your node is performing and identify any potential issues. Do you have any other questions about the `ping` command or Verus?\n\n**User:**\nAnd one more question, how can I use the `listbanned` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listbanned` command is a straightforward one. It can be used to list all banned IPs/Subnets. You can run it using the following commands:\n\n```\nverus listbanned\n```\n\nor\n\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"listbanned\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\nThis command can be helpful for managing your node's banlist and ensuring that you're not interacting with malicious or unwanted peers. Do you have any other questions about the `listbanned` command or Verus?",
