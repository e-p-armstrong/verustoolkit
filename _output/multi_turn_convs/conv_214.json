    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the fees involved in using Verus. What is the fee structure for currency conversions on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe fee for currency conversions on Verus is 0.025%, which goes entirely to miners and stakers. Additionally, an implied volatility fee is planned to be implemented, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, to ensure that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers' risk with earnings from implied volatility fees.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also heard concerns about front running during currency conversions. How does Verus prevent front running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus prevents front running by processing all transactions in a group simultaneously, converting them at the same rate, and with no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. This ensures that all users get the same price for their conversions, regardless of the direction of the exchange.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I'm also interested in launching a new currency on Verus. What flexibility does Verus offer in terms of currency launch options?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus allows currencies to be launched with a range of options, including:\n\n* Accepting a range of other currencies\n* With or without fractional reserve capabilities\n* Integration with other blockchains through the Verus import/export protocol\n* Automatic send/receive of Verus network tokens between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, with currencies sent between Verus and ETH expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great. What features does Verus offer to support the launch of a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers several features to support the launch of a new currency, including:\n\n* Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or automatically refund\n* Dynamic currency launch pricing based on participation\n* Pre-launch participation price discounts\n* Pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts\n* Price-neutral launch pre-allocations\n\nAll of these features are specified in easy-to-understand commands and parameters, with no programming necessary.",
