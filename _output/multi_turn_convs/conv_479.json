    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been using VRSCTEST for a while, but I just updated to the new version. What should I do if I have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release, you need to delete specific directories on your system before running the new update. The directories to delete vary depending on your operating system:\n\n* On Linux, delete `~/.komodo/vrsctest`.\n* On MacOS, delete `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`.\n* On Windows, delete `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`.\n\nMake sure to delete these directories before running the new update to avoid any issues. Do you have any more questions about VRSCTEST or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I do. What kind of warranty or liability does the software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software comes with no warranty of any kind, express or implied. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. It's essential to understand that you use the software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I did get a warning from my antivirus software, Avast, when I tried to install the software. Why might antivirus software like Avast or Kaspersky flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAntivirus software like Avast or Kaspersky might flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it includes mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. These warnings are false positives, and you can find more information about them in the provided resources. Don't worry, the software is safe to use, and the warnings are just a precautionary measure taken by your antivirus software. Do you have any more questions about Verus or VRSCTEST?",
