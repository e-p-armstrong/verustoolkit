    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing some rumors about the RaceCondition currency on the Verus chain. What's going on with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the RaceCondition currency was launched with a very low reserve of 10 VRSC, a high supply of 100 million, and a volatile 5% algorithmically controlled fractional reserve of Verus. The creator of the currency exited with their entire pre-launch amount, leaving the currency with far fewer reserves relative to supply than it had before, essentially performing an exit scam.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds pretty serious. What was the underlying issue that caused the problem with the RaceCondition currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe underlying issue was that the fractional currency fees that should have been burned into the basket were not being captured in the case of a straight conversion from fractional to a reserve. This resulted in a buffer at the extreme, where the person who entered the currency ended up with more than they would have, had the math been properly distributing those fees.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that DeFi was paused due to this issue. Why was that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDeFi was paused because the calculations involved in the issue are consensus-critical, and any error in them, including fees, is taken very seriously. The update will operate on the updated rules when the oracle notifications are removed and DeFi is reactivated. We're working hard to ensure the integrity of our ecosystem, and pausing DeFi was a necessary step to prevent any further issues.",

            "As everyone can see, there is a currency on the chain called RaceCondition, which someone has defined and is a 5% algorithmically controlled fractional reserve of Verus. While these currencies are tools, and there may be good reasons for 5% currency components or even 5% currencies in some applications, this was launched as a VERY low reserve (launched with 10 VRSC in reserves), high supply currency (100 million supply), and as volatile as the protocol allows at 5%.The extreme nature of the currency and the fact that the person who launched it exited with their entire pre-launch amount when someone else joined resulted in a behavior different than what I would expect. Someone converted into the currency, which was clearly all in the hands of one individual. That individual then converted all of the currency they got at launch to VRSC, getting the highest price they could get for all of their currency and leaving the highly volatile, 5% fractionally backed currency with far fewer reserves relative to supply than it had before, basically an exit scam for a grand total of 4 VRSC.The thing that made me take notice is that there seemed to be more reserves left and a higher price at the end of this operation than I\u2019d expect in the currency, and that turned out to be because only in the case of a straight conversion from fractional to a reserve, not in any other case, the fractional currency fees that should have been burned into the basket were not being captured. Interestingly, in this case it resulted in a form of buffer at the extreme, where the person who entered RaceCondition for 5 VRSC after it was launched and subsequently had 4 of it taken on the exit from one person converting 100,000,000 of the supply ended up with more than they would have, had the math been properly distributing those fees. This was the totality of the issue we found, and though it may not seem that serious to require a pause of DeFi, these calculations are consensus, and we take any error that we find in them, fees or otherwise, quite seriously. This update will operate on the updated rules when the oracle notifications are removed and DeFi is reactivated.",
