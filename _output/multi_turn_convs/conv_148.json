    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was trying to install the Verus software, but my antivirus flagged it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI see! Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potential Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about it. Don't worry, it's just a precautionary measure!\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the Verus test release for public blockchains as a service (PBaaS). What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis test release of Verus is intended for testing and development with public blockchains as a service (PBaaS). Although it also works with the Verus mainnet, it does not support PBaaS on mainnet and is not an official release. It is recommended to use it at your own risk and not as a main wallet. Just keep that in mind when you're experimenting with it!\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in defining a sample chain using Verus. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a sample chain using Verus, you can use the following command:\n\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [{\"reward\" : 10000000000}], \"notarizationreward\" : 1440000000, \"billingperiod\" : 1440, \"nodes\" : [{\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2500\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"\"}, {\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2501\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"RDyDzC5JB66Y29fzBkamywqEn1PJXTzj8B\"}]}'\n```\n\nThis will define a sample chain for you to play around with. Let me know if you have any questions about the parameters!\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the minimum requirements for defining a chain using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum requirements for defining a chain using Verus are:\n\n* A maximum of 3 eras\n* A minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations\n* A minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization\n* VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet to make a chain\n\nJust make sure you meet these requirements, and you'll be good to go!\n\n**User:**\nHow do I connect to a defined chain using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOnce a chain is defined, you can connect to it using the command:\n\n```\n./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\n\nOn the first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine. That's it!\n\n**User:**\nWhere are the config files for PBaaS chains stored?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe config files for PBaaS chains are stored in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME` directory, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain. The presence of a correct config file for any chain enables the chain to load as an independent chain. Just a FYI!",
