    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to mint new coins of \"mycoin\" using the command line and Verus. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins of \"mycoin\", you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n\nThis command will mint 10,000 new coins of \"mycoin\" and send them to the address \"mike@\". Did that work for you?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, thanks for that! Before I launch the VRSCTEST testnet, is there anything I need to do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBefore launching the VRSCTEST testnet, you need to delete the following directories:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST` and `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\VerusTest`\n\nMake sure to delete those directories before proceeding. Do you have any further questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. How do I actually launch the VRSCTEST testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch the VRSCTEST testnet, you can use the following command:\n\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST\n```\n\nDid that work for you?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, thanks! Just out of curiosity, what's the disclaimer for using this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is experimental and unfinished, and is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. It's always important to be aware of the terms of use!\n\n**User:**\nI've been having some issues with my antivirus software flagging the Verus software as malware. Can you explain why that might be happening?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software may be flagged as malware by antivirus software because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, the warnings are false positives, and the software is safe to use. You don't need to worry about it!",
