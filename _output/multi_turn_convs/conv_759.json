    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the inner workings of the Verus network. How do PBaaS chains work in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. This allows them to start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. This means they can tap into the collective power of the Verus community to improve and maintain their own blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a great way to create a blockchain. What capabilities do users with a VerusID have in terms of creating their own tokens and blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsers with a VerusID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. This blockchain can be 50% POW/50% POS and 51% hash attack resistant. This means that users have a high degree of control and flexibility when creating their own blockchain-based projects.\n\n**User:**\nI see. How do simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches work in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, you can launch a world-class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but are bound to the launch of the new blockchain, run on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity. This allows for a seamless and efficient way to create a new blockchain and liquidity pool at the same time.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds convenient. What are Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi fractional basket currencies are currencies defined by ID owners with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. This means that users can create their own currencies with custom backing and liquidity pools, and the Verus DeFi protocol will ensure that conversions are handled fairly and efficiently.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about crowdfunding on Verus. What are blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBlockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds allow you to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of their contributions. This applies to both single launches (blockchain only) and dual launches (blockchain and bridge). This means that users can create crowdfunding campaigns for their blockchain-based projects and ensure that they have the necessary participation before launching.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are some potential uses of VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. Additionally, the VerusID protocol can be implemented on non-Verus systems. This means that VerusIDs can be used as a convenient and user-friendly way to interact with blockchain-based systems.\n\n**User:**\nLastly, what are some potential attacks that VerusIDs protect against?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs protect against the $5 wrench attack and identity theft. This means that VerusIDs provide an additional layer of security and protection for users and their digital assets.",
