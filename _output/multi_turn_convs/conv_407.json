    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to import an address with a lot of transactions into the GUI wallet. What should I expect?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen importing an address with many transactions into the GUI wallet, you should expect the following:\n\n* The GUI wallet will not show any progress on the import.\n* You may receive messages indicating that the RPC daemon is not reacting.\n* The import process will take a significant amount of time to complete in the background.\n\nJust be patient and let the process run its course. Do you have any idea why this process takes so long?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that's actually my next question. Why does importing a cryptocurrency address take a long time to complete?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe import process takes a long time to complete because it has to process a large number of transactions associated with the address being imported. This can be a time-consuming process, especially if the address has a high transaction volume. The wallet needs to sync all those transactions to ensure everything is accurate and up-to-date. That's why it takes a while.",
