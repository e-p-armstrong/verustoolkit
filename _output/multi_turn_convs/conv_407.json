    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was looking at the Verus commands and I'm not entirely sure what the `getblockhashes` command does. Can you explain its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblockhashes` command returns an array of block hashes between two given timestamps. It can be used to retrieve a range of block hashes within a specific time period. Do you have any further questions about this command or would you like to know how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that helps. How do I use the `getblockhashes` command to retrieve block hashes between two timestamps?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo use the `getblockhashes` command, you need to provide two required arguments: `high` and `low`, which are the newer and older block timestamps, respectively. You can also provide an optional `options` argument, which is a JSON object that can include `noOrphans` and `logicalTimes` properties.\n\nHere's an example:\n```bash\nverus getblockhashes 1231614698 1231024505 '{\"noOrphans\":false, \"logicalTimes\":true}'\n```\nThis command would retrieve the block hashes between the timestamps `1231614698` and `1231024505`, with the specified options. Do you have any more questions about this command or would you like to know more about Verus in general?",
