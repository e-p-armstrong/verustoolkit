    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've got a bit of an issue. My antivirus software is flagging the Verus software as a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). What can I do about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a common issue. If your antivirus software flags the Verus software as a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", it's likely because the software includes mining capabilities, which may be used by third parties to exploit your PC. You can review the resources provided by Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives. They have helpful information on why Verus might be flagged and how to resolve the issue.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks! Another thing I was wondering about is how I can verify the authenticity of a Verus download.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the file or checksum, respectively. For example:\n\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AebXJgABQR877X9cSmsrmj3SE08+rgCb0pvwhp7JmSh+m0r2Swg9dhC4Yyra+GWBj0A0fcPH3o7OjvB6P/BMfDsvxFeQVO7e\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v1.0.3-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v1.0.3-x86_64.tar.gz\"\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AebXJgABQR877X9cSmsrmj3SE08+rgCb0pvwhp7JmSh+m0r2Swg9dhC4Yyra+GWBj0A0fcPH3o7OjvB6P/BMfDsvxFeQVO7e\" b5ddb0576ac4d1ce5d6cd3c53946b8ca89bdc4e76f680caa822b181d8660199f\n```\n\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I was also wondering about the changes in Verus v1.0.2.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus v1.0.2 is a mandatory mainnet upgrade that fixes several issues, including a regression that prevented staking on locked IDs as well as modifying locked IDs on the mainnet, and issues discovered on the Gravity chain that blocked resolution of cross-chain challenges on the testnet. There are no feature changes in v1.0.2, but it includes minor API fixes, proof improvements, and other minor updates. The testnet will transition to the v1.0.2 protocol without a reset on May 17, 2023.",
