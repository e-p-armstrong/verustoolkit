    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to download Verus for my operating system, and I want to make sure it's safe. Can you provide the links to check for virus detection on Verus downloads for different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nHere are the links to check for virus detection on Verus downloads:\n- MacOS: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c48816428e6baf6158eee0f553e587c7c7af73aa02ef7ffb4b84a2c3e72eba7a/detection\n- Linux-x86-64: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7aa2923ce230e0cf96a981d5c1431b627aae2991958c380f64fffa6e7bbcabd1/detection\n- Linux-ARM64: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/691899be0d2cbdbd67cc58be042eec60e1f8b9f819347e026b3e556c9fc9a82a/detection\n- Windows: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6b2a03233a1eac9c27df66ee86a2490173d60248f55d5d2e35df1f1a442f6fcf/detection\n\nPlease make sure to check these links before downloading Verus. Do you have any further questions about virus detection or Verus downloads?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. Why might antivirus software flag Verus downloads as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAntivirus software might flag Verus downloads as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because they are mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. For more information, refer to resources like https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/ and https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/.\n\nThis doesn't mean that Verus is malicious, but rather that antivirus software may flag it due to its mining capabilities. Do you have any more questions about Verus and antivirus software?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download by following these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to check the signature and hash of the downloaded file. This ensures that your download is genuine and has not been tampered with. Do you have any more questions about verifying Verus downloads?\n\n**User:**\nI heard about a v1.0.4 update. What is it, and is it mandatory?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v1.0.4 update is a critical, non-mandatory mainnet upgrade that rectifies potential refund failures in edge cases for mainnet DeFi or crosschain wallet functions. While it is not required for mainnet synchronization or mainnet function past PBaaS activation, it is highly recommended to upgrade to v1.0.4 or later before May 23, 2023, expected block #2549420. For continued testnet use, upgrade as soon as possible.\n\nSo, while it's not mandatory, it's highly recommended to upgrade to v1.0.4 to ensure the smooth functioning of Verus. Do you have any more questions about the v1.0.4 update?",
