    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHi! I'm trying to verify a file using a checksum with the CLI. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify a file using a checksum with the CLI with the following command:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AcFjDQABQSDvcPZH+EBJHnQR491hRjINjwGtaVf3S8wFwNAY0KwYF1Qj3z0kndcLIJKqDCVKWj5RarHjCApwUGbjYK4x29Uc 0cbd162064918fb63a8914c0cf963e0eb310fcd100daa7433a9066c6806491e1\n```\nDo you have any questions about this command or would you like to know more about verifying files with the CLI?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that helps! What is the result of a successful verification using the CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of a successful verification using the CLI is `true`. If you don't get `true`, it means the verification failed, and you might want to check the file or the checksum.\n\n**User:**\nI'm using Verus CLI v0.6.4. What are some of the new features in this version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the new features in Verus CLI v0.6.4 include:\n\n* Estimated active staking supply displayed in output from `getmininginfo`\n* Average block fees for last 100 blocks displayed in `getmininginfo` output\n* Immature coins, including time locked coins displayed in `coinsupply` output\n* Eligible staking balance, with consideration for all disqualifying factors displayed in `getwalletinfo` output\n* `z_exportwallet` as wallet backup now accepts boolean parameter to remove all addresses with no UTXOs or Identities in the backup\n* Staking performance is improved\n* Fixed rare condition of improper ID wallet synchronization of transferred or revoked IDs\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about these features or if there's anything else I can help you with!\n\n**User:**\nWhat's unique about Verus digital signatures?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer the first worldwide verifiable, decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft. This is unique compared to traditional blockchain signatures, which lack critical capabilities such as friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's included in the txt file for verifying downloads?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe txt file for verifying downloads includes the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\".\n\n**User:**\nCan I verify a file directly using the CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can verify a file directly using the CLI with the following command:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AcFjDQABQSDvcPZH+EBJHnQR491hRjINjwGtaVf3S8wFwNAY0KwYF1Qj3z0kndcLIJKqDCVKWj5RarHjCApwUGbjYK4x29Uc /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.6.4-amd64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.6.4-amd64.tar.gz\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions about this command or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
