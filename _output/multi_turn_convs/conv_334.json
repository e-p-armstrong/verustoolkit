    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about tokenizing ID control as a next-generation NFT. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo tokenize ID control as a next-generation NFT, you need to define a currency with the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN` flags, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre-allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n\nHere's an example command:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```\nThis should help you tokenize ID control as a next-generation NFT. Do you have any more questions about this or other Verus-related topics?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! I also have a question about signing transactions from a multi-signature ID on both the testnet and mainnet. Can you walk me through that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign transactions from a multi-signature ID, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency`.\n2. Get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency` and use it to get the raw hex transaction data with `verus z_getoperationstatus`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it with `verus signrawtransaction`.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.\n\nThis process should allow you to sign transactions from a multi-signature ID on both the testnet and mainnet. Do you have any questions about these steps or need further clarification?\n\n**User:**\nGreat, I think I understand that. One more question: how do I create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent, you need to use the `registernamecommitment` command with two additional positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. You can leave fields blank by using quotes `\"\"`.\n\nHere's an example command:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr \"\" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny\n```\nThen, you need to specify the parent in the identity definition and register the identity using the `registeridentity` command. Does that make sense? Do you have any other questions about Verus or VerusIDs?",
