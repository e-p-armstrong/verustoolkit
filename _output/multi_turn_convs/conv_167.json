    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nBefore I start using Verus, I want to make sure I understand the terms. What is the license under which this software is released?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis software is released under a permissive free software license, which grants users the freedom to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software. The license includes a condition that the enclosed copyright notice and permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. Do you have any questions about the license or would you like to know more about Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What kind of warranty is provided with this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In other words, there is no warranty or guarantee that the software will work as expected or will not cause any harm.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the liability of the authors or copyright holders of this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders of this software shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. \n\n**User:**\nI've heard that some antivirus software might flag this software. Why might that happen?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAntivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky might flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program) because it is mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not actually malicious.",
