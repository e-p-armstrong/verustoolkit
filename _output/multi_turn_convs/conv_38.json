    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm having some trouble running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution. Can you tell me what causes these error messages?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThese error messages are caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default on the Linux distribution. Do you want to know how to solve these error messages?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please! I'm getting errors like \"error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory\" and \"error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory\". How can I solve them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo solve these error messages, you need to install the `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries using the command `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`. This should fix the issue. Do you want to know why these error messages occur in the first place?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that would be great. Why do these error messages occur when running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThese error messages occur because not all dependencies are installed by default on a Linux distribution, specifically the `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries. That's why you need to install them manually.\n\n**User:**\nSo, just to make sure, how can I solve the error messages \"error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory\" and \"error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory\" when running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo solve these error messages, you need to install the `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries by running the command `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`. This should fix the issue.\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of error messages might I encounter when running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution like Debian or Devuan?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou might encounter error messages like `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` or `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory`. These are usually caused by missing dependencies, which can be easily installed using the command I mentioned earlier.",
