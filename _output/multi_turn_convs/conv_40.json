    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nSo, what kind of warranty does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that you use the software at your own risk, and the authors or copyright holders of the Verus software are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from its use.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What is the liability of the authors or copyright holders of the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders of the Verus software shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. This means that they are not responsible for any losses or damages you may incur while using the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that some antivirus software might flag the Verus software as malicious. Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's correct. Avast and Kaspersky might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit the user's PC. This is a false positive, and more information about it can be found in the provided resources. It's not actually malicious, but rather a precautionary measure taken by the antivirus software.\n\n**User:**\nWhat features does the Verus public testnet offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. This allows developers to test and experiment with the Verus protocol in a safe and controlled environment.\n\n**User:**\nHow does the Verus protocol handle conversions between currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus protocol enables fully decentralized conversions between currencies, with a standard protocol fee of 0.01% that goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network. The protocol calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread. This means that conversions are fast, secure, and with minimal fees.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the current release of the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe current release of the Verus software is a test release intended for testing and development with public blockchains as a service (PBaaS). It has not been tested for use on mainnet. This means that it's not yet ready for production use, but rather for testing and experimentation by developers and enthusiasts.",
