    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus launches. What features do they provide to encourage maximum participation and fairness?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus launches provide features such as pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and vesting schedules in the pre-allocations to encourage maximum participation and fairness. These features help ensure a fair and open process for everyone involved.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also been learning about the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can be easily set up with bridging of public currencies. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also testing some things on the testnet. What's important to note about testnet coins/currencies in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. So, keep in mind that anything you're testing is just for testing purposes and won't have any real-world value or consequences.\n\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with identities in Verus. How does revoking an identity affect its locked status?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRevoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. Additionally, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. So, if you revoke an identity, it will no longer be locked.\n\n**User:**\nI've been using the `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example, `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\n**User:**\nHow do Notary IDs work in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. They play a crucial role in facilitating interoperability between different blockchains in the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the `timelock` parameter when updating an identity in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `timelock` parameter defines either the unlock height of the identity (Time Lock) or the number of blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state (Time Delay). It allows you to specify when an identity should be unlocked or delayed in terms of block height or time.",

The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. ## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale** - The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. ### Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}' ``` - **Time Delay:**  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}' ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ## Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g.
