    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the recent release of Verus. What changes were made in the v0.9.6-1 release of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.9.6-1 release of Verus fixed two testnet issues: a fault when initiating mining and staking on a small number of machines, and sync from scratch issues on testnet. There were no mainnet changes, no protocol changes, and no known changes required. Do you have any other questions about this release?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What's the current status of the DeFi, ID, and PBaaS cross-chain protocols on testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAs of the current release, there are no known bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross-chain protocols on testnet. The Verus Coin Foundation is offering bug bounties for anyone who can find and report any protocol bugs before mainnet release. Would you like to know more about the bug bounties?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What are the bug bounties being offered by the Verus Coin Foundation for finding protocol bugs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC for the first 10 people who report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release. For reports of exploitable security holes, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for serious potential security issues, 10,000 VRSC. Are you interested in testing the protocols and earning a bounty?\n\n**User:**\nI might be. But first, I need to reset my testnet. What do I need to do to reset my testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your testnet, you need to close Verus, delete the following directories, and then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native). The directories to delete depend on your operating system: for Linux, it's `~/.komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`; for Mac OS, it's `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest`; and for Windows 10, it's `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`. Would you like more information on testing the protocols?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's all I need to know about that. But I do have one more question. What are some additional capabilities of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome additional capabilities of Verus include on-chain launches of token, centralized currency, and liquidity basket AMMs; on-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming; and on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles. These capabilities make Verus a powerful and flexible platform for a wide range of use cases.",

We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all of the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release.

If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.If you have reported a bug, since the bounties for the 0.9.5+ versions were announced, you are on the list, and someone from the Foundation will reach out to you in the near future.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release.
