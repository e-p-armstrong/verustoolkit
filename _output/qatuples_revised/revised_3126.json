    "How can I verify the integrity of a downloaded Verus package using the command line?",
    "You can verify the integrity of a downloaded Verus package using the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command with the `verus` CLI tool. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n**Verifying a file directly:**\n```bash\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AXY1GwABQR+zDdT4vg66nRnK/0lvyxWRsHUf0tg6mAzJSv7a5BVrpzCjxnKr3zOPhxtrxpaNOU5duU4+69S/pqY7HSq4k6MJ /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.0-1-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.0-1-x86_64.tar.gz\n```\n\n**Verifying using a checksum:**\n```bash\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AXY1GwABQR+zDdT4vg66nRnK/0lvyxWRsHUf0tg6mAzJSv7a5BVrpzCjxnKr3zOPhxtrxpaNOU5duU4+69S/pqY7HSq4k6MJ d2e5fc890f646773624c55797d2dd38bab35a2839ad208ec0b668d34b24b27d3\n```\n\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.",
    "## Verifying Downloads A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, is included for each download. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". 1) Extract downloaded archive 2) Verify signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. 3) Extract archive to desired directory ### CLI examples **Verifying file directly** ``` ./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AXY1GwABQR+zDdT4vg66nRnK/0lvyxWRsHUf0tg6mAzJSv7a5BVrpzCjxnKr3zOPhxtrxpaNOU5duU4+69S/pqY7HSq4k6MJ /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.0-1-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.0-1-x86_64.tar.gz ``` **Verifying using a checksum** ``` ./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AXY1GwABQR+zDdT4vg66nRnK/0lvyxWRsHUf0tg6mAzJSv7a5BVrpzCjxnKr3zOPhxtrxpaNOU5duU4+69S/pqY7HSq4k6MJ d2e5fc890f646773624c55797d2dd38bab35a2839ad208ec0b668d34b24b27d3 ```**The result will be true if the signature is valid.** ``` true ``` # Announcing MANDATORY Verus v0.9.0 Mainnet Release of Verus Vault and the on-chain NFT and ID Marketplace ## TO REMAIN CONNECTED TO THE MAINNET VERUS BLOCKCHAIN, YOU MUST UPGRADE FULL NODES TO v0.9.0 OR LATER BY BLOCK 1796400, which is expected to occur on or around Monday, November 29th at 6:15PM UTC.## Verus ID and NFT Marketplace Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.## Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.",
