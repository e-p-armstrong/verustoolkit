    "What is the purpose of the `revokeidentity` command in Verus?",
    "The `revokeidentity` command is used to revoke an identity on the Verus blockchain. This command can also be used to create a name commitment, which is not the same as registering a name. The command takes several arguments, including the name or ID to revoke, an optional return transaction flag, an optional token revoke flag, a non-standard fee amount, and an optional source of funds.",
    "### `revokeidentity \"nameorID\" (returntx) (tokenrevoke) (feeoffer) (sourceoffunds)` #### Arguments: ``` \"nameorID\"            (string, required) the unique name to commit to. creating a name commitment is not a registration, and if one is                            created for a name that exists, it may succeed, but will never be able to be used. \"returntx\"            (bool,  optional) defaults to false and transaction is sent, if true, transaction is signed by this wallet and returned \"tokenrevoke\"           (bool,  optional) defaults to false, if true, the tokenized ID control token, if one exists, will be used to revoke \"feeoffer\"            (value, optional) non-standard fee amount to pay for the transaction \"sourceoffunds\"          (string, optional) transparent or private address to source all funds for fees to preserve privacy of the identity``` #### Result: ```json {   \"txid\" : \"hexid\"   \"namereservation\" :   {     \"name\"  : \"namestr\",   (string) the unique name in this commitment     \"salt\"  : \"hexstr\",   (hex)  salt used to hide the commitment     \"referral\": \"identityaddress\", (base58) address of the referring identity if there is one     \"parent\" : \"namestr\",   (string) name of the parent if not Verus or Verus test     \"nameid\" : \"address\",   (base58) identity address for this identity if it is created   } } ``` ### Examples: ```bash > verus revokeidentity \"nameorID\" > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"revokeidentity\", \"params\": [\"nameorID\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/ ```### `setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\":absoluteblockheight || \"setunlockdelay\":numberofblocksdelayafterunlock}' (returntx) (feeoffer) (sourceoffunds)` Enables timelocking and unlocking of funds access for an on-chain VerusID. This does not affect the lock status of VerusIDs on other chains, including VerusIDs with the same identity as this one, which has been exported to another chain.Use \"setunlockdelay\" to set a time unlock delay on an identity, which means that once the identity has been unlocked, numberofblocksdelayafterunlock must then pass before the identity will be able to spend funds on this blockchain. Services which support VerusID authentication and recognize this setting may also choose to prevent funds transfers when an ID is locked.",
