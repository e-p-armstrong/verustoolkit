    "What are the PBaaS options available in Verus?",
    "The PBaaS options available in Verus include:\n\n* `-acceptfreeimportsfrom`: accepts underpaid imports from specific PBaaS chains or networks\n* `-allowdelayednotarizations`: allows delayed notarizations to prevent slowing down the network\n* `-alwayssubmitnotarizations`: submits notarizations to the notary chain whenever eligible\n* `-approvecontractupgrade`: votes to agree to upgrade to a specific contract\n* `-blocktime`: sets the target block time for difficulty adjustment\n* `-chain`: loads either the mainnet or a specific PBaaS chain\n* `-miningdistributionpassthrough`: uses the same mining distribution values and addresses/IDs as Verus when merge mining\n* `-notarizationperiod`: sets the minimum spacing consensus between cross-chain notarization\n* `-notaryid`: specifies the VerusID used for PBaaS and Ethereum cross-chain notarization\n* `-notificationoracle`: specifies the VerusID monitored for network alerts, triggers, and signals\n* `-powaveragingwindow`: sets the averaging window for PoW difficulty adjustment\n* `-testnet`: loads the PBaaS network in test mode",
