    "What are the important updates included in the latest Verus release?",
    "This release includes activation support for VerusID, and relative adjustment to the CPU and FPGA-equalizing VerusHash 2.1 Algorithm. Additionally, there will be a mandatory hardfork of the Verus mainnet protocol at block 800200, and this update is required to remain on the Verus mainnet.",

MAKE SURE TO UPGRADE BY DECEMBER 15TH, OR YOU MAY NEED TO RESYNCHRONIZE THE BLOCKCHAIN IF YOU ARE RUNNING IN NATIVE MODE**# Verus ID VerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. VerusIDs provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, VerusID provides:### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.",
