    "How can I access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge, and what do I need to use it?",
    "You can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge at https://ethtest.verus.services. To use it, you will need to have some Goerli Ethereum, which you can obtain from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus. You will also need to use your MetaMask wallet.",
    "## Verus PBaaS and DeFi RC5 - BUG BOUNTIES At this time, we are not aware of any bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross chain protocols on this version of testnet. We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all of the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release. While we don\u2019t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended. If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.## Emoji IDs and \ud83c\udf83Chain In the spirit of this release day, we have taken advantage of VerusIDs and currency emoji support and created a new, merge mineable PBaaS chain, \ud83c\udf83. It has been said that those who merge mine \ud83c\udf83chain at midnight will disappear into the crypto-metaverse, never to be seen again, become VerusID avatars, and be forever doomed to being bought and sold on the VRSCTEST marketplace for all eternity (or until the next testnet reset). YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!We expect the Ethereum bridge to be brought back up on the new Verus testnet within the next day or two. When it is up, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services, and use your metamask to convert or send cross-chain to the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the #pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for mainnet release in the next couple weeks and start building your vision today!## Testnet Reset To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):",
