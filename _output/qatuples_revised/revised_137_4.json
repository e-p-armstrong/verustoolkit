    "What is Verus PBaaS Reserve technology, and what are its benefits?",
    "Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization to create a fractional reserve currency on an independent blockchain with cross-chain interoperability, without any costs beyond public blockchain network fees. This technology offers benefits such as immediate usability for payments and conversions to other currencies from within the Verus wallet, with 100% of the 0.01% conversion fees going directly to the miners and stakers of the organization's new chain.",
    "With no costs beyond public blockchain network fees, Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization of any size to make a fractional reserve currency of its own on an independent, uncluttered blockchain with cross-chain interoperability, and immediately useful for payments and conversion to other currencies from within the Verus wallet. 100% of the 0.01% fees for such conversions go directly to the miners and stakers of the organization's new chain, and those miners and stakers also have the option of merge mining up to 14 other blockchains and coins while mining their own project, improving efficiency, profitability, and shared liquidity for everyone involved. Each blockchain is independent and connected through the Verus Reserve protocol . **Launching the testnet:** ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST ```# Chain definition:- Maximum of 3 eras - Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations. - Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization. VRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.**Sample chain definition:** ``` ./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{\"name\":\"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\",\"premine\":50000000000000,\"initialcontribution\":5000000000000,\"conversion\":100000000,\"minpreconvert\":45000000000000,\"maxpreconvert\":100000000000000,\"launchfee\":0,\"billingperiod\":14400,\"notarizationreward\":100000000000,\"eras\":[{\"reward\":5000000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0,\"eraoptions\":1}],\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"ipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"}, {\"networkaddress\":\"2ndipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"}]}' ```The example above defines a chain that emits a premine to the indicated address and also converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.",
