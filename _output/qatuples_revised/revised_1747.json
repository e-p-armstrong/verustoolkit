    "How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download using the command line?",
    "To verify the authenticity of a Verus download using the command line, you can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. You can do this by running the command:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <file_path>\n```\nReplace `<signature>` with the signature from the text file, and `<file_path>` with the path to the extracted archive file.\n\nAlternatively, you can verify the download using a checksum:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <checksum>\n```\nReplace `<signature>` with the signature from the text file, and `<checksum>` with the checksum of the file.\n\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.",
    "## Verifying Downloads  A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, is included for each download. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". 1) Extract downloaded archive 2) Verify signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. 3) Extract archive to desired directory ### CLI examples **Verifying file directly** ``` ./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AU+tHQABQR+/ObpwL0kRP/cIf4PvNMa/GBJa2f82LrGDGF8S45GHOlfZwHM7kL5X0Qst+1IVD8O1adW8TeAlqZY6EIOh0Q5/ /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.1-1-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.1-1-x86_64.tar.gz ``` **Verifying using a checksum** ``` ./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AU+tHQABQR+/ObpwL0kRP/cIf4PvNMa/GBJa2f82LrGDGF8S45GHOlfZwHM7kL5X0Qst+1IVD8O1adW8TeAlqZY6EIOh0Q5/ 62819af68f302a39a02fe17ab3b917f4c51f6286e67dc3966718fe059299ff6c ```**The result will be true if the signature is valid.** ``` true ``` # ANNOUNCING NON-MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET, MANDATORY FOR TESTNET PBAAS UPGRADE v0.9.1 ## Testnet Featuring Verus PBaaS -- The most powerful and interoperable currency, blockchain, and ERC20 launch, scale, and MEV-resistant DeFi platform to exist, all with no programming required!### v0.9.1 improves mainnet bootstrap and GUI backup/restore user experience but does not upgrade mainnet protocols and is not a required update for mainnet-only users. It is required to use the public testnet. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED TESTNET WITH PRIOR VERSIONS, MAKE SURE TO DELETE AND CLEAR ANY EXISTING TESTNET DATA FOLDERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.## Verus PBaaS Features Live on v0.9.1 Testnet - Provable or pseudonymous, identity-based currency, liquidity pool, NFT and multi-blockchain, fully decentralized network. - On-chain 100% decentralized, launches with fair launch and/or crowdfunding options, on-chain auto-refund option for missed targets, automatic Ethereum ERC20 contract deployment, auto-created, MEV-resistant, liquidity baskets and even auto-bridged, merge mineable, fully independent rent-free PBaaS blockchain launches. - All DeFi AMM conversions are verified via mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol. All conversions in a single liquidity basket are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block, meaning all participants get the same price in all directions of conversion, with a minimum conversion fee of 0.025% and a maximum of 0.05%. - All currencies and identities are primitives at L1 and are validated and verified on UTXO transactions, which check all inputs and outputs just as single currency L1, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin check the native currency inputs and outp",
