    "How can I sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID on the Verus testnet or mainnet?",
    "To sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using the `verus sendcurrency` command.\n2. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n3. Use the `verus signrawtransaction` command to sign the transaction with each additional wallet.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using the `verus sendrawtransaction` command.",
