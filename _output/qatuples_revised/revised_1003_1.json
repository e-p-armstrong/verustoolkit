    "What is the status of the Ethereum bridge, and how can I access it?",
    "Although its deployment has been delayed, there are no technical blockers, and it's expected to be brought back up on the new Verus testnet within the next day or two. You can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge at https://ethtest.verus.services/, and use your MetaMask to convert or send cross-chain to the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features, you'll need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.",
