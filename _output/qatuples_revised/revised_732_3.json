    "What is Verus Vault, and what kind of protection does it offer?",
    "Verus Vault is a decentralized solution that provides a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery for your IDs, NFTs, and assets. It offers time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance, and allows you to protect and recover your funds, preserving your blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, without the need for a bank.",
    "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyoe with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.## Testnet Reset To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest` - Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest` - Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain  ```  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'  ```## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet) Create transaction, get raw transaction data:  ```  verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'  verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>  ``` Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:  ```  verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>  ``` After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:  ```  verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>  ```",
