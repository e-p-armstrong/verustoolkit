    "What is required to make a chain using Verus PBaaS Reserve technology?",
    "To make a chain using Verus PBaaS Reserve technology, you need VRSCTEST in your wallet. Additionally, there are some requirements for the chain definition, such as a minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations, a minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization, and a maximum of 3 eras.",
    "Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization of any size to make a currency with its own blockchain, support it in world class wallets, develop its own applications, and use it for payments worldwide that can be converted to the reserve currency without ever having to leave the blockchain network. Each blockchain is independent and connected through the Verus Reserve protocol. # Notable Changes - Fixed daemon output export error message on VRSCTEST - Fixed fees bouncing back from a reserve send to Verus and allow exports to continue if done incorrectly - Include currency state in chain definitions for both getchaindefinition and getdefinedchains# Chain definition:- Maximum of 3 eras - Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations. - Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization. VRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.**Sample chain definition:** ``` ./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{\"name\":\"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\",\"premine\":50000000000000,\"initialcontribution\":5000000000000,\"conversion\":100000000,\"minpreconvert\":45000000000000,\"maxpreconvert\":100000000000000,\"launchfee\":0,\"billingperiod\":14400,\"notarizationreward\":100000000000,\"eras\":[{\"reward\":5000000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0,\"eraoptions\":1}],\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"ipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"}, {\"networkaddress\":\"2ndipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"}]}' ```The example above defines a chain that emits a premine to the indicated address and also converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.",
