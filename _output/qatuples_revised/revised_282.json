    "How does Verus Vault technology benefit users in terms of security and peace of mind?",
    "Verus Vault technology provides users with the peace of mind that their funds, identity, and estate planning are protected from lost or stolen private keys. This advanced time lock capability ensures that users' assets are safeguarded, even in the event of theft or loss of private keys.",
    "- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities On the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
