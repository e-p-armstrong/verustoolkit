Scroll down to the bottom of the page. It will list the rewards as `mined` or `minted` in green. The TXIDs that staked the minted rewards are shown in blue. ## Verus Agama (Deprecated): In the GUI you can also click yourself thru to that information. 1. Click on the magnifying glass all the way on the right of the transaction. 2. On the pop-up click on \"Open in the VRSC Explorer\" bottom left. 3. In the VRSC explorer click on the block hash value (in light blue) \u2013 now the block hash is displayed as the title of the box. 4. Click on the info \"i\" on the right and click on \"search\": in the result displayed for blocktype 'mined' or 'minted'.(edited) (submitted by karero, edited by Oink.vrsc@) Note: last revision date 2020-11-11.",
