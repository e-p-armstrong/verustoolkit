    "What is the origin of Verus, and what technologies does it leverage?",
    "Verus is a fork of Zcash and Komodo, and it leverages the Komodo platform. It also appreciates the contributions and support from the Bitcoin developers, as it builds upon their foundation. Verus supports Bitcoin and Zcash compatible transaction types, as well as Komodo cross-chain swaps and dPoW security enhancements.",
    "# Welcome to Verus## The Future Is NowHere is a collection of information meant to span several platforms and services in order to keep all of us more informed on what\u2019s happening across the growing, world-wide community. It will also help to connect us, allowing us to discuss what\u2019s being worked on, what can be done to help and as a way to look ahead in a more involved way.Verus, latin for \u201cTrue\u201d, combines all of the features we believe are important in a cryptocurrency, and provides a foundation for future development. Verus is a fork of Zcash and Komodo that leverages the Komodo platform, and we appreciate the contributions and support from those teams as well as the Bitcoin developers that created a foundation for us to launch new capabilities **in a system that supports Bitcoin and Zcash compatible transaction types as well as Komodo cross chain swaps** and dPoW security enhancements.1. Verus Coin is a pure technology provider and does not endorse third party projects. 2. Be your own bank: **you** are responsible for securing your coins and taking backups. 3. **No VerusCoin community member, admin, or developer should __ever__, under __any__ circumstances, ask for your private keys or for you to send coins to them. Please __report__ any incident in the #community-support channel.**## The VerusCoin Community is YOU\\!If you\u2019ve been around long enough and feel a little skeptical or disillusioned from a few bad experiences elsewhere, it\u2019s totally understandable. We\u2019ve all had them and we know quite well that when unscrupulous projects abuse words like decentralization, interoperability, or protocol level solutions, it can have a *\u201cboy who cried wolf\u201d* effect.We believe that actions speak louder than words. Anything that may be considered hype can be backed up with functional examples. What we\u2019re doing here is genuine. We are trying to be the real deal, **just as Bitcoin started out, as an open-source, fair launched, no ICO, or pre-mined, or even dev funded project.** Despite this, a foundation has been established by and for fellow community members. There is always more to be done and the foundation regularly pays out bounties to community members that help to make the Verus vision a reality. In fact, just about everything has been designed to reinforce the community. Designed with efficiency in mind, only the miners and stakers are rewarded for securing the chains. This ensures bare minimum costs to the end user starting up a chain and the sleek UI removes the technical barrier.## NEW TO VERUS?### What we\u2019re about:",
