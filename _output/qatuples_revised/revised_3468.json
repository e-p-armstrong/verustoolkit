    "Why do some antivirus software flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?",
    "The software is flagged as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) by some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, because it is mining software that can potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not actually malicious.",
