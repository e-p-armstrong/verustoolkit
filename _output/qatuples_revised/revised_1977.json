    "What happens when a cheating staker is caught by the \"Cheat Catcher\"?",
    "When a cheating staker is caught by the \"Cheat Catcher\", the cheating staker's coins are taken away and rewarded to the \"Cheat Catcher\" instead. This means that earning a cheat catching reward does not create new coins, but rather takes them from cheaters.",
    "- All versions of the Verus Coin wallet from **0.4.0** and later have support for **Sapling high performance zero knowledge transactions**, which will activate on the Verus Coin Network at block **227520**. In addition to basic Sapling support, 0.4.0c includes support for Sapling compatible, transparent mobile transactions. **For lite mode usage on the Verus Coin or Zcash networks, you will need Verus Enhanced Agama v 0.4.0c.**- In addition to Sapling and support for Stake Guard transactions, which all versions **0.4.0** or later have, 0.4.0c also includes a powerful *\u201cCheat Catcher\u201d* that can earn money as miners and stakers who use it protect the Verus Coin network by catching stakers who are staking for rewards in a selfish way that does not contribute to converging the network on one blockchain. **The new \u201cCheat Catcher\u201d support requires a Sapling z-address, either passed in to the CLI wallet with the \u201c-cheatcatcher=zaddress\u201d option, or added in the Settings->App config of the enhanced Agama GUI.**- Once your cheat catcher address has been set, a **full node wallet that is mining OR staking, will also be looking for forks where the same winning coins may be posted on two different forks, signed by the same person.** If this is ever discovered, the the mining or staking wallet will create a transaction that has cryptographic evidence of the cheating and submit it for shielding to the cheat catcher\u2019s address. That means that while staking or mining, anyone who has a Sapling cheat catcher address set, may periodically find an additional shielded coinbase or two in their cheat catching address. **Earning cheat catching rewards does not new create coins, but actually takes them from cheaters, so DON\u2019T CHEAT :) !** Earning a cheat catching reward can also occur whether or not you earn a block reward and is available equally across the network to all miners and stakers, more dependent on who happens to observe the cheating fork and catches the cheater than on staking or mining power.## Version 0.4.0c also fixes the following issues reported in prior versions: - Wallet balance can get out of sync with blockchain when staking - Some non-Latin usernames cause failure to load - When used to load KMD in GUI Agama, Komodo stops accruing interest after transfer ### IF YOUR WALLET IS OUT OF SYNC, YOU CAN RESCAN TO FIX THE PROBLEM.",
