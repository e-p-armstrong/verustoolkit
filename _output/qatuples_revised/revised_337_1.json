    "How do I create a raw transaction to retrieve the funds?",
    "To create a raw transaction, you need to use the CLI-interface. In Verus Desktop, run the command: `run createrawtransaction '[{\"txid\": \"yourtxid here\", \"vout\": fill in too}]' \"{\"destination addr\": <amount>}\" <current Blockheight -5>`. Replace `\"yourtxid here\"` with the actual TXID of the locked funds, `\"vout\"` with the corresponding vout value, `\"destination addr\"` with the address you want to send the funds to, `<amount>` with the amount you want to send, and `<current Blockheight -5>` with the current block height minus 5.",
    "# Question: I accidentally send funds to my b-address and cannot move those fundsFunds sent to a b-address get locked in the same manner as the original coinbase reward was. However, because they were not sent using a script to lock those coins, they can be retrieved, without waiting the full unlock period (typically between 3 and 27 months).Warning: DO NOT send to a b-address, unless you kow what you're doing.## procedure### First you need to determine the **TXID** of the locked funds.1. The easiest way is to obtain the TXID from the send transaction you did in Verus-Desktop to the b-address. Make a copy of the TXID: you will need it for this procedure 2. The next easiest way is look up the b-address on the [explorer](https://explorer.verus.io) and examine the transactions to this address. The youngest transaction is usually the one you need. On the explorer the hash in the transaction is the TXID. Make a copy of the TXID: you will need it for this procedure 3. In Verus Desktop, go to `Settings` --> `Coin Settings` and make sure `VRSC` is selected in the top right. Run the command: ```bash run listunspent 0 <BLOCKCOUNT> '[\"<YOUR-b-ADDRESS\"]' ``` Replace `<BLOCKCOUNT>` with the current blockcount your wallet is on. Replace `<YOUR-b-ADDRESS` with the actual b-address where the coins are. You will receive a result similar to this: ```json [{ \"txid\": \"fa5962ebf61ef31867ba73b173433841f8f68578d53b4bb30cfe1432b5820f15\", \"vout\": 10, \"generated\": false, \"address\": \"iBSUZSgXHEGGz65GTT6BGgchtkTHoFBs57\", \"amount\": 2.20005763, \"interest\": 0, \"scriptPubKey\": \"050403000000cc1b04030001011504575dc6ae7484c83c0dc97a4218f88e2cbe9b659c75\", \"confirmations\": 159, \"spendable\": true }] ``` Make a copy of the TXID: you will need it for this procedurenote: The above result is an example. ***DO NOT*** use data from it.### Now we need to create a raw transactionTo create a raw transaction, we will need to use the CLI-interface.
