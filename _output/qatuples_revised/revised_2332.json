    "Why might I need to check for Verus processes using `ps fax | grep verus`?",
    "You might need to check for Verus processes using `ps fax | grep verus` if the `./verus getinfo` command throws an error, to verify if Verus is indeed running in the background. This helps you determine if the error is due to Verus already being running or if there's another issue.",
    "# ERROR: Cannot Get a lock on data directory /root/.komodo/VRSC. Komodo is probably already running. ## Procedure: It just means you can't start it when it's already running. If it isn't running we can take a look at it. Check to see if it is running by running: `./verus getinfo` If it's running you'll get info back, if it isn't you'll get an error. If that throws an error, it's worth checking using this command: `ps fax | grep verus` and seeing if any processes are listed besides the process you're using to search. You would see verusd with a child process of komodo and all its cli arguments. (submitted by @keda666, solution written by englal.vrsc@) Note: last revision date 2020-02-26.",
