    "## Verifying Downloads A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, is included for each download. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". 1) Extract downloaded archive 2) Verify signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. 3) Extract archive to desired directory ### CLI examples **Verifying file directly** ``` ./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" ARJwGAABQSAEzdWu0ba5tX9dSzAPIJsuuYhh/+Fd4F3m0uPsQHLCWCr6PGjzCB+aC5uBtVxtheSL1ATWW6nDv6/OwyEDtK4V /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-x86_64.tar.gz ``` **Verifying using a checksum** ``` ./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" ARJwGAABQSAEzdWu0ba5tX9dSzAPIJsuuYhh/+Fd4F3m0uPsQHLCWCr6PGjzCB+aC5uBtVxtheSL1ATWW6nDv6/OwyEDtK4V f99dfbd27d8b97eb14861d37371858c545a293e56ec8dd742ffa4f2365966af9 ```**The result will be true if the signature is valid.** ``` true ``` ## Announcing immediate availability of NON-MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED ESPECIALLY FOR NOTARIES, HIGH PEER COUNT PUBLIC NODES, AND POOLS, v0.7.3-9 Verus CLI.In addition to more immediate and effective bad node banning behavior, v0.7.3-9 includes a fix for signrawtransaction that could sometimes result in failure of countersigning a multisig, ID-based raw transaction.While this release does include network robustness and a multisig fix, we were also able to upgrade Verus multisig capabilities to an ease of use and level of capability beyond other networks we are aware of today. In this release, it is now possible, on both mainnet and testnet, to issue any \u201csendcurrency\u201d command with the source being a multisig ID, for which you do not have all the keys present in your wallet. If you do, there will be a return error in operation status, from both GUI or CLI, and in that error will be the partially signed transaction, which can be used by applications or with copy and paste to send to other signers with partial authority over the source ID. On mainnet, destinations for such a transaction can include IDs, private addresses with memos to a z-address or ID:private, and transparent addresses. On testnet, such transactions can include all that is possible on mainnet as well as multiple currencies, currency conversions, and cross-chain sends.To our knowledge, this release raises the industry standard for multisig capability and its support on public blockchain protocols to a new level, even before considering the multisig revocation and recovery capabilities.",
