    "What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does it work?",
    "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where you can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) directly on-chain. You can advertise your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. You can pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, and accept payment to either as well.",
    "You can use setidentitytimelock in one of two ways: ``` verus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":1796500}' (returntx) ``` or ``` verus setidentitytimelock '{\"setunlockdelay\":1440}' (returntx) ``` or ``` verus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":0}' (returntx) ``` The first example will lock the ID until the block specified. If the block specified is in the past, the ID will not be locked. The second example will set a 1440 block unlock delay, which will be needed to wait before spending funds controlled by the ID after unlocking the ID (about one day unlock time). The third example will unlock an ID that has been locked with an unlock delay, and the unlock time will be set to the block height at which the ID was unlocked + the originally set unlock delay.## Verus ID and NFT Marketplace Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.## Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.",
