    "Is the calculated average time to find one block a guarantee of when I'll find a block?",
    "No, the calculated average time to find one block is not a guarantee of when you'll find a block. It's an average value, which means that in real life, you may find a block much sooner or later than the calculated time. However, in the long run, the actual time it takes to find blocks will average out to the predicted value.",
    "[gimmick: math]() # Question: I'm mining since XYZ with XYZ, why I haven't found a block yet? $$ Average Time To Find One Block = ( \\frac{NetworkHashrate}{LocalHashrate} ) * BlockTime $$ One block = 6 coins (as now) NetworkHashrate = retrieved by `getmininginfo` command from </>CLI LocalHashrate = retrieved by `getmininginfo` command BlockTime = 60 seconds (average) note: The above formula assumes you are already mining and your hashrate is already included in the `NetworkHashrate`. For very large LocalHashrate calculations (what-if-I-had scenario) add it to the NetworkHashrate yourself. Real example with - 31 threads AMD Ryzen 5950x @ 4.4Ghz - $$ Average Time To Find One Block = ( \\frac{851125882237}{46159950} ) * 60 $$ $$ Average Time To Find One Block = 1,106,317 seconds (307 hours or little under 13 days) $$ Bear in mind that these are average times to find a block. In real life you may hit a block much sooner or later after finding the last. In the long run it averages out to the values predicted.
