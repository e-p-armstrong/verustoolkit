    "You can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies with sufficient liquidity for conversions between BTC and ETH by running the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
    "gs are set back to an unlocked state.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'   ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ## Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g. BTC ETH:**   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth   ```   Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.## Sending and Converting Currency **Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**",
