    "What should I do if I have a non-standard directory for my Verus wallet.dat, Chaindata, and VRSC.conf files?",
    "If you have a non-standard directory for your Verus files, you should navigate to that directory and check if the `VRSC.conf` file has been overridden during the update. You may need to edit the `VRSC.conf` file to specify the correct `datadir` using a command like `nano VRSC.conf`.",
    "7. STOP the Verus daemon     ./verus stop   Check whether it has stopped running with this command. (To be doubly sure you can also look in the debug file in the )     top   (This time `verusd` should **NOT** appear in this list.) 8. Rename the old versions of the binaries (replace the version numbers with the version being replaced)   (This ensures you can easily revert to the old version by renaming these files.)     mv verus verus-v0.7.3-9     mv verusd verusd-v0.7.2-9 9. Check they have been renamed     ls-la 10. Unpack/unzip the binaries for the latest version     tar -xvf Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tar.gz 11. Check if they have unpacked/unzipped in the directory     ls -la 12. If the directory where your Verus wallet.dat, Chaindata & VRSC.conf files are stored is in a non standard place - eg on a mounted external hard drive - you may have a datadir specified in your VRSC.conf file.   Navigate to that directory to check your datadir is still correct. The VRSC.conf file may have been overidden in the update. This ensures the Verus daemon knows where to find the blockchain you have currently saved on your system.     cat VRSC.conf   If it requires editing, use nano to edit this file     nano VRSC.conf   & append this to the VRSC.conf file :      datadir=[your custom file path for your mounted hard drive] 13. Start the Verus daemon again on the new version (add any other start options from https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-01_verusd_options.md)     ./verusd 14. Check the version     ./ verus getwalletinfo 15. Once you are satisfied the new version is working, clean up the older binares (from step 8) by deleting them (or just move them to another directory using the same mv command as step 8)     rm verus verus-v0.7.3-9     rm verus verusd-v0.7.3-9 Information compiled by `Mercadinaut.vrsc@`.
