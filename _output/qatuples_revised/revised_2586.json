    "How do I download the latest ARM64 version of the Verus CLI wallet?",
    "You can download the latest ARM64 version of the Verus CLI wallet by using the command `wget https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/download/v0.7.3-10/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tgz` (replace v0.7.3-10 with the latest version number).",
    "# Updating the ARM CLI wallet.Attention: Read it completely before use.## Necessary files:Link 1: [Download latest Wallet](https://verus.io/wallet)## Verus `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata & `VRSC.conf` standard locations * ARM Linux:\t\t`~/.komodo/VRSC`Note: Due to the size of the blockchain, on an ARM installation this directory is usually stored on a mounted external hard drive. This will have its own file path that was specified when the drive was mounted. Thus the path to `~/.komodo/VRSC` directory is likely to be user-specified & thus non-standard on an ARM.---(NB This version is aimed at inexperienced users, so it includes the associated routine/basic Linux commands. You will need access to the relevant directories, which may require sudo priveleges)(NB Raspberry Pi ARM boards lack some instruction sets to mine, though the Pi3 & Pi4 are ARM64 & can be used as staking devices if an ARM64 operating system is installed)---## Procedure:1. Navigate to the directory which contains the verus daemon binary file (the default is in the home directory - ie ~/verus-cli)     cd verus-cli 2. Check the Verus daemon is running - you will need to keep it running to check the downloaded file's signature     top   (`verusd` should appear as one of the processes in the list. If you need to start it use the command `./verusd`.) 3. Download the latest ARM64 version. Check https://verus.io/wallet/command-wallet   (The commands below are for v0.7.3-10) Don't forget to change the version number to whichever one you are updating.     wget https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/download/v0.7.3-10/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tgz 4. unpack/unzip the download into the signature file and the binaries tar/zipped file     tar -xvf Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tgz 5. Check it has unpacked/unzipped & open the signature file     ls -la     cat Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-3-arm64.tar.gz.signature.txt-file   This will display the signature information to verify the downloaded file is authentic.6. CHECK the signature by using the data in the signature file     ./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"[signature string from signature.txt-file]\" [your home directory file path]Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tar.gz   The return should be **`true`**. If you have an issue add \"\" around the file path.",
