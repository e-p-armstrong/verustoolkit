The CLI-wallet and Verus Desktop GUI wallet are available on the link above for Windows, Linux and MacOS. If you already have a wallet verify that the wallet is the most recent version and update if needed. ### Verus Desktop Wallet ### 1. Start your Verus Desktop wallet. 2. If you have never run Verus testnet on your system before:  1. Go to `settings` (cogwheel icon) and select `General Settings`.  2. Select `Enable VRSCTEST`.  3. Click `Save Changes`  4. Restart Verus desktop 3. When logged in, click `Add Coin`, select `Verus Testnet` and click `Continue`. 4. Select the startup parameters you desire (Native (Lite mode is not available on testnet), Staking, mining (specify number of threads), reindex blockchain and/or rescan wallet) and click `Add Coin`. **CLI wallet** 1. start CLI walletdaemon using these parameters:  `verusd -chain=VRSCTEST`   Any extra parameter that you are used to for VRSC (like `-mint` or `-pubkey=`) can be appended as well. 2. commands through the CLI are in the following format:  `verus -chain=VRSCTEST`   The only difference with the normal VRSC chain is the `-chain=VRSCTEST` option, that is added.
