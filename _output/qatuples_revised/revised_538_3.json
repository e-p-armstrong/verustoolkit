    "What is Tokenizing ID control, and how does it relate to `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN`?",
    "Tokenizing ID control is a next-generation NFT feature that allows for the creation of tokenized control tokens. This feature is enabled by setting the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN` flags in a currency definition, and setting a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre-allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.",
    "Once the Goerli Ethereum liquidity basket (Bridge.vETH) activates on testnet, which is a 100% backed basket composed of 1/3rd each of Verus, Ethereum, and USDC (all testnet tokens), you can use it from Metamask on Goerli, from the Verus CLI or GUI on the vrsctest chain, or from CLI/GUI on other PBaaS chains to provide liquidity while holding Bridge.vETH, a 100% backed basket of three currencies of balanced relative value, or to pass through and convert currencies between Verus, Ethereum, USDC, and Bridge.vETH.The Brige.vETH currency also coordinates with the vETH@ gateway and enables registering `*.veth@` IDs for $5 worth of Bridge.vETH, based on its internal USDC conversion price at the time of registration. When you register `*.veth@` IDs, 0.02 VRSCTEST goes to miners and stakers, and $5 worth of Bridge.vETH is burned, reducing the total supply of Bridge.vETH for everyone without reducing reserves, and contributing to the relative value, \u201creal yield\u201d of Bridge.vETH, relative to its three reserve currencies. This is the way that all decentralized, fractional currencies which enable ID registration accept registration fees, equally benefiting all fractional currency holders/liquidity providers when IDs are registered, while providing Verus miners and stakers the identity import fee of 0.02 VRSC.`*.veth@` IDs have the ability, along with root vrsctest IDs, to make 1:1 ERC20 mapped currencies on Ethereum. They can also be used to create Tokenized ID control tokens (see notes for v0.9.4-1), as all types of IDs can, but if they are used to do that, they will have used their currency creation ability for that rather than an ERC20 mapped currency.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release.
