    "What factors affect the average time to find one block?",
    "The average time to find one block is affected by three main factors: NetworkHashrate, LocalHashrate, and BlockTime. NetworkHashrate is the total hashrate of the entire Verus network, LocalHashrate is your own mining rig's hashrate, and BlockTime is the average time it takes to mine one block, which is 60 seconds in Verus.",
    "[gimmick: math]() # Question: I'm mining since XYZ with XYZ, why I haven't found a block yet? $$ Average Time To Find One Block = ( \\frac{NetworkHashrate}{LocalHashrate} ) * BlockTime $$ One block = 6 coins (as now) NetworkHashrate = retrieved by `getmininginfo` command from </>CLI LocalHashrate = retrieved by `getmininginfo` command BlockTime = 60 seconds (average) note: The above formula assumes you are already mining and your hashrate is already included in the `NetworkHashrate`. For very large LocalHashrate calculations (what-if-I-had scenario) add it to the NetworkHashrate yourself. Real example with - 31 threads AMD Ryzen 5950x @ 4.4Ghz - $$ Average Time To Find One Block = ( \\frac{851125882237}{46159950} ) * 60 $$ $$ Average Time To Find One Block = 1,106,317 seconds (307 hours or little under 13 days) $$ Bear in mind that these are average times to find a block. In real life you may hit a block much sooner or later after finding the last. In the long run it averages out to the values predicted.
