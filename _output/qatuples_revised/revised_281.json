    "How can I participate in a blockchain launch and convert from reserve before the chain has started using the command line?",
    "You can participate in a blockchain launch and convert from reserve before the chain has started by using the `sendreserve` command with the `preconvert` option. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"preconvert\": 1}'\n```\nThis command sends a reserve and converts it to the native coin of the new chain at the current market price.",
