    "How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?",
    "To verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. This text file contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command in the Verus CLI to verify the signature. For example:\n\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" /path/to/downloaded/file.tar.gz\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AUX2FwABQR//3tYmE7EmZs5gVUIQCLdy8VI4D1/MBM53bRLpq3C2cXLScU4bdJek6orr9VQE5vPGnuR568r5uM2cVpBjzyGB b2edf4d8501851b655e62fe4c188589f9602d595837b1dec74825de4911022bc\n```\n\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.",
