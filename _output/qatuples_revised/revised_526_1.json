    "What if the `./verus getinfo` command throws an error?",
    "If the `./verus getinfo` command throws an error, it's worth checking using the command `ps fax | grep verus` to see if any Verus processes are listed besides the process you're using to search. You should see `verusd` with a child process of `komodo` and all its CLI arguments.",
    "# ERROR: Cannot Get a lock on data directory /root/.komodo/VRSC. Komodo is probably already running. ## Procedure: It just means you can't start it when it's already running. If it isn't running we can take a look at it. Check to see if it is running by running: `./verus getinfo` If it's running you'll get info back, if it isn't you'll get an error. If that throws an error, it's worth checking using this command: `ps fax | grep verus` and seeing if any processes are listed besides the process you're using to search. You would see verusd with a child process of komodo and all its cli arguments. (submitted by @keda666, solution written by englal.vrsc@) Note: last revision date 2020-02-26.",
