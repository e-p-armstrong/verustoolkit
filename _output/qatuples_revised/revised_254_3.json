    "How can I preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency before it is active using the `sendcurrency` API?",
    "You can preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency before it is active using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```",
    "Currencies can be launched to accept a range of other currencies and with or without fractional reserve capabilities. Verus import/export protocol was designed to make integration with other block chains provable and easy, and there are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, where currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network, and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.# Preparing for Multi-chain, Dynamic Merge Mining While this 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology which was running on testnet last year. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies as well.## Sending and Converting Currency **Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds. **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):** ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]' ``` **Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):** ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]' ``` **Converting VRSCTEST to another currency, TESTCOIN:** ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"TESTCOIN\"}]' ``` **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:** ``` verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]' ```## Defining a Currency",
