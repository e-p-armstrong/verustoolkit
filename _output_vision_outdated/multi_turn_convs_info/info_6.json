            "The three fundamental pillars of the Verus Project's vision are:\n\n1. Extreme transaction throughput and scalable decentralized applications with autochains, which provide public blockchains as a service (PBaaS).\n2. Selectively strong, private identity.\n3. Open application support with a foundation of polls, voting, and lottery selection services.",

Extreme transaction throughput and scalable decentralized applications with autochains,\nwhich provide public blockchains as a service (PBaaS)\n2. Selectively strong, private identity, and\n3.

            "The three pillars work together to create a virtuous circle, where the correct operation of each pillar strengthens the others. This enables the processing of human knowledge, understanding, and/or opinion on any content or topic, and creates a secure, public platform that respects privacy, potentially serving as the foundation of a more respectful society.",
