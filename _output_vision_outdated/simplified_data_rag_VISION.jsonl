Unless its owner reveals information\nto link two or more identities, it is cryptographically hard \u2013 meaning virtually impossible\n\u2013 to correlate one identity to another.

As part of the Verus vision, to be described in\nmore detail in later phases, we intend to support fully decentralized verification of identities\nthat can provide as strong verification as today\u2019s centralized systems. At the same time, we\nbelieve it is important for practical reasons to enable compatibility with centralized forms of\nidentity and to enable people to optionally support KYC in identities. To enable a smooth\nbridge between centralized and decentralized identity systems, today\u2019s ID systems, including\nbiometric and government issued IDs, will be supported via centralized or decentralized\nverification to enable use of Verus identity in situations that require conformance to knowyour-customer (KYC) regultions. Theseforms of ID, however, are not required to establish\nor use even strong, decentralized identities on the Verus network.\nVerus autochains, will operate parallel to the main Verus chain and enable large-scale\napplications \u2013 such as polls or elections \u2013 to run simultaneously without concern for congestion or excessive fees. Autochains will enable poll application users to provision their\nown secure blockchains just by using the application \u2013 spawning dynamic parallel chains\nthat can process thousands (or potentially millions) of transactions per second when needed.\nAutochains will operate by proof of stake, enabling each chain to have security isolated to\nits direct user population. Autochains will also be backed by Verus notarization and block\ntime synchronization \u2013 providing the full weight of its PoW/PoS security layer as well as the\nKomodo platform\u2019s delayed proof of work (dPoW), to provide notarization all the way back\nto the full power of the actual Bitcoin blockchain.\nFor Phase II, what we expect to be an extended development phase, we will work to\nimplement autochains and their first application in the world. We will eventually use them\nto create, secure, scale, and perform polls for everything from classifying online content,\nto identifying real public opinion, to actual, real-time elections for an organization or \u2013\nconceivably \u2013 a government.\nOur goal is to make these polls easy to use from a PC or mobile device, yet industrial\nstrength and suitable for serious, secure elections.

The lottery requires that a prior block hash 100\nblocks past combined with a qualifying UTXO of the destination public key hashed with the\nstaking block height and then divided by the UTXO value must be under the current proof\nof stake validation difficulty.

But \u2013 beyond this currency \u2013 Verus seeks to become much more than\na zero-knowledge privacy coin, one with two completely new highly-decentralizing proof\nof work and proof of stake algorithms.\nIn addition to payments, decentralization, and privacy features, Verus Project\nplans include its direct use as a currency for provisioning scalable and secure public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), for Verus applications built upon these parallel\nchains to scale. What this will do is simple: It will enable all people \u2013 as well as\nall nodes on the Verus network to participate in and benefit from a decentralized,\nblockchain service economy.\nThis paper details the Verus vision and describes the function of Verus as its own\nplatform, and also as a member of the Komodo platform ecosystem, in the context of its\nfirst applications. Verus core applications will provide a foundation to build additional\napplications and services, which will leverage Verus\u2019 automatically created blockchains,\ncalled autochains. Autochains \u2013 or PBaaS \u2013 will be provisioned and notarized by the\nVerus blockchain miners and stakers, in exchange for Verus currency.\nAutochains will be validated through proof-of-stake by their user populations. In\naddition to extremely scalable, dynamic, publicly-secured autochain applications, this\nwill add a dynamic isolation and security component to applications that can also\ncreate, manage, and verify transactions on the main Verus chain or any other Komodocompatible, Crypto-Conditions [17], Interledger Protocol [25] enabled blockchains.\nThe ways we apply this technology to our world \u2013 to our biggest contemporary\nchallenges \u2013 has the potential to completely remake the fabric of our society.1"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Hey there!
