    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been trying to learn more about the voting and polling features in Verus. Can you tell me about the different types of voting defined in the Verus taxonomy?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus taxonomy defines the following types of voting:\n\n1. Multiple choice\n2. Weighted multiple choice\n3. Ranking\n4. Rating\n\nThese types of voting will give users a range of options for casting their votes and expressing their opinions. Do you have any other questions about voting in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What about polls? What are the different types of polls defined in the Verus taxonomy?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus taxonomy defines the following types of polls:\n\n1. Polls to classify\n2. Polls to select\n3. Polls to rank\n4. Polls to rate\n\nThese types of polls will allow users to gather information and opinions on a wide range of topics. Do you have any other questions about polls in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was wondering about the focus of the Verus core team in terms of voting and poll types. What's the plan here?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUntil Phase IV, the Verus core team plans to focus on known requirements of multiple choice and weighted multiple choice voting. After the completion of Phase IV, expanding support for other voting and poll types will be a higher priority. This will allow us to establish a solid foundation for voting and polling in Verus before expanding to other types.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What features may each type of Verus poll support?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach type of Verus poll may support:\n\n* Confidential or public voting\n* Live or delayed poll results\n* Online or offline vote authorization\n* Lottery selected vote authorization\n\nThese features will give users a high degree of flexibility and control when creating polls in Verus. Do you have any other questions about polls or voting in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What's the initial rollout plan for vote models in Verus, and what types of voting will they support?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe initial rollout plan for vote models in Verus will provide solutions for weighted and unweighted selection voting, which fits well for both political and opinion polls as well as content classification and ID verification. This will give users a solid foundation for voting and polling in Verus, and we can build from there.",
