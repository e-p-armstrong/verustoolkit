    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in the Verus Project's vision. What are the three fundamental pillars of the Verus Project's vision for a better society through public blockchain services?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe three fundamental pillars of the Verus Project's vision are:\n\n1. Extreme transaction throughput and scalable decentralized applications with autochains, which provide public blockchains as a service (PBaaS).\n2. Selectively strong, private identity.\n3. Open application support with a foundation of polls, voting, and lottery selection services.\n\nThese pillars form the foundation of the Verus Project's vision for a better society. Would you like to know more about how they work together?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that would be great! How do the three pillars of the Verus Project (extreme transaction throughput, selectively strong private identity, and open application support) work together to achieve the project's vision?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe three pillars work together to create a virtuous circle, where the correct operation of each pillar strengthens the others. This enables the processing of human knowledge, understanding, and/or opinion on any content or topic, and creates a secure, public platform that respects privacy, potentially serving as the foundation of a more respectful society.\n\nBy combining these pillars, the Verus Project aims to create a robust and scalable ecosystem that supports the growth of a more equitable and just society. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI think so. I also heard about something called Verus Virtue. What is Verus Virtue, and how does it fit into the Verus Project?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Virtue is a concept that can be thought of as a separate currency that can be earned, but not purchased or sold. It is part of the evolution of the Verus proof-of-stake algorithm, slated for later phases of the Verus project. Proof of Virtue is a technology that will be implemented in later phases of the project, and will be described in greater detail at that time.\n\nEssentially, Verus Virtue is a mechanism that rewards positive behavior and contributions to the Verus ecosystem, and will play a key role in shaping the future of the project. Would you like to know more about the Verus Project or its vision?",
