    "What features will Verus's polls and elections have to ensure security and privacy?",
    "Verus's polls and elections will have the following features to ensure security and privacy:\n\n* Confidentiality: No one but the voter knows who or what they voted for, unless the voter discloses.\n* Results can be withheld until the vote is complete, at which time they can be released to everyone simultaneously.\n\nThis ensures that voters' privacy is protected, and the results of the vote are secure and trustworthy.",
    "a\n\nEach identity will have its own, unique address. Unless its owner reveals information\nto link two or more identities, it is cryptographically hard \u2013 meaning virtually impossible\n\u2013 to correlate one identity to another. At the same time, the owner of an identity can still\ncryptographically verify statements made about identities under their control, attesting to\nidentity properties (such as passport, age, height, citizenship, photo, etc.) as strongly as\nis possible with today\u2019s digital technology. As part of the Verus vision, to be described in\nmore detail in later phases, we intend to support fully decentralized verification of identities\nthat can provide as strong verification as today\u2019s centralized systems. At the same time, we\nbelieve it is important for practical reasons to enable compatibility with centralized forms of\nidentity and to enable people to optionally support KYC in identities. To enable a smooth\nbridge between centralized and decentralized identity systems, today\u2019s ID systems, including\nbiometric and government issued IDs, will be supported via centralized or decentralized\nverification to enable use of Verus identity in situations that require conformance to knowyour-customer (KYC) regultions. Theseforms of ID, however, are not required to establish\nor use even strong, decentralized identities on the Verus network.\nVerus autochains, will operate parallel to the main Verus chain and enable large-scale\napplications \u2013 such as polls or elections \u2013 to run simultaneously without concern for congestion or excessive fees. Autochains will enable poll application users to provision their\nown secure blockchains just by using the application \u2013 spawning dynamic parallel chains\nthat can process thousands (or potentially millions) of transactions per second when needed.\nAutochains will operate by proof of stake, enabling each chain to have security isolated to\nits direct user population. Autochains will also be backed by Verus notarization and block\ntime synchronization \u2013 providing the full weight of its PoW/PoS security layer as well as the\nKomodo platform\u2019s delayed proof of work (dPoW), to provide notarization all the way back\nto the full power of the actual Bitcoin blockchain.\nFor Phase II, what we expect to be an extended development phase, we will work to\nimplement autochains and their first application in the world. We will eventually use them\nto create, secure, scale, and perform polls for everything from classifying online content,\nto identifying real public opinion, to actual, real-time elections for an organization or \u2013\nconceivably \u2013 a government.\nOur goal is to make these polls easy to use from a PC or mobile device, yet industrial\nstrength and suitable for serious, secure elections. They will leverage the latest cryptographic\ntechnologies for privacy \u2013 known as zero-knowledge proofs \u2013 to preserve confidentiality.\nThey will be:\n\u2022 Confidential \u2014 No one but the voter knows who or what they voted for \u2013 unless the\nvoter discloses. Results of the vote can be withheld until the vote is complete, at which\ntime they can be released to everyone, simultaneously.\n",
