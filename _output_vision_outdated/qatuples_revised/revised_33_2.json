    "What is the Verus team's vision for digital systems?",
    "The Verus team's vision for digital systems is to create a system that respects users' privacy, gives them control over their data, and enables them to speak their minds with anonymous authority. This system should support the needs of businesses and governments while prioritizing the benefit of society.",
    "t\n\nInformation vies for our attention in today\u2019s digital world, trying to convince us of what\nproduct to use or which politician to believe. We are watched and measured as we react to\nthat information, in order to convince us what to buy or to believe. This is an active process\nthat exploits our lack of online privacy \u2013 combined with weaknesses in human psychology \u2013\nin order to make profit; extracting value from, even affecting our behavior, learning about\nand influencing each of us individually to open our wallets or add our voices to another\u2019s\nagenda.\nNo single person can digest and fully understand \u2013 let alone verify \u2013 a fraction of the\ninformation hrust at us in daily life. We are told to give up on the notion of privacy and to\ntrust networks of companies with our most private data, our identity, our credit histories, our\nlocation, our habits. We are also told that our voices are lost in the digital sea of information.\nYet how is this the same sea through which we are laser-targeted based on correlating our\nbehaviors to learn so much about us, individually? What if these technologies could be\nturned towards the benefit of society, first \u2013 and then allowed to support businesses, in that\ncontext?\nWe on the Verus team believe it is possible to support businesses and governments\nrequirements with digital systems that: 1) respect your privacy, 2) give you control over\nyour data, and 3) enable you to speak your mind with the anonymous authority of an\nauthorized voter or member of a community, in a way that can directly be heard and affect\nactual change.\nBefore we explain how, it would help to understand the shared beliefs behind our vision\nfor Verus. These beliefs underpin everything we build into the Verus network:\n1. We believe that every human has ideas, knowledge, and value to contribute to our\nsociety. By using technology to reward people for their contributions, we can enable\neach of our verifiable, yet anonymous voices to be heard as a collective truth.\n2. We believe that those who contribute positively over time to the system should be\nrewarded for that contribution and provided with ongoing incentive.\n3. We believe that a world-scale, peer-to-peer system that can enable humans to be\nqueried directly, confidentially, verifiably \u2013 and in a transparent manner \u2013 can directly\nprovide populations of people and the world with valuable, transformative tools.\nWith Verus, we will introduce digital tools to enable us all to build a better world\ntogether. We will monetarily incentivize \u2013 with our technologies \u2013 behavio",
