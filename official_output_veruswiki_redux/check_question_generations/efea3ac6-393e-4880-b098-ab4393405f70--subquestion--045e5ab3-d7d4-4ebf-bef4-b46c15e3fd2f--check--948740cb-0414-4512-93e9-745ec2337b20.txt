    # error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    When running `./verusd` on a Linux distro (eg Debian or Devuan), not all dependencies
    may be installed by default, resulting in the errormessage `error while loading
    shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` or `error while loading
    shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory`.


    To solve this you need to install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries:

    `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`

    ### In-Depth Analysis of the Text:

    #### Content and Depth: The text details a solution to a dependency issue that
    may come up when running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution. It describes that
    the libraries `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` may not be installed by default, and
    provides a `sudo apt-get install` command to install them.

    #### Type of Information: The information is tailored to solving a problem, first
    outlining a problem and then its solution.


    ### Detailed Understanding of the Question:

    #### Core Requirement: The question asks about the root cause of the errors `error
    while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` and `error
    while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory` that may occur
    when running `./verusd`.

    #### Depth of Detail: The question requires an understanding of the fundamental
    cause of the errors.


    ### Targeted Comparison of the Question with the Text:

    #### Content Match: The text aligns perfectly with the question, as it explicitly
    states the root cause of the errors mentioned in the question.

    #### Depth Match: The text provides the necessary level of detail to answer the
    question.


    ### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:

    The text addresses both components of the question with sufficient detail, making
    it: RELEVANT.'

    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is ava\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text):\n\

    ### In-Depth Analysis of the Text:

    #### Content and Depth: The text discusses the benefits of VerusIDs as a fully
    functional blockchain protocol, outlining how they are quantum-friendly, fully-decentralized,
    revocable, recoverable, private, & powerful.

    #### Type of Information: The information is descriptive/educational, teaching
    people a concept related to Verus and the Verus ecosystem.


    ### Detailed Understanding of the Question:

    #### Core Requirement: The question asks broadly about what crypto-addresses are
    and how they ensure privacy.

    #### Depth of Detail: The question requires information about crypto-addresses
    in general, including how they help ensure privacy of their users.


    ### Targeted Comparison of the Question with the Text:

    #### Content Match: The text talks about VerusIDs (a type of crypto-address) and
    the benefits of VerusIDs, whereas the question addresses crypto-addresses in general.
    This is something of a mismatch, as the text does not discuss crypto-addresses
    in general.

    #### Depth Match: The text lacks information on crypto-addresses in general, instead
    focusing on VerusIDs. The privacy benefits of VerusIDs are mentioned, but not
    the privacy benefits of crypto-addresses in general.


    ### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:

    Although the text describes a specific type of crypto-address (VerusIDs), it does
    not cover crypto-addresses in general, nor does it talk about the privacy conferred
    by crypto-addresses in general, as is required by the question, making it: IRRELEVANT.'

    \ even make money through referrals and built into the identity transactions themselves,\
