    "How can I export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the command line and Verus?",
    "You can export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the `sendcurrency` command. The basic format is:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\n\nReplace `IDNAME@` with the ID you want to export, `PBaaSChainName` with the name of the PBaaS chain you're exporting to, and adjust the `amount` and `currency` as needed.",
    "The good news is that throughout the whole process of this first bridge release on testnet, we've been able to update through the issues we've seen without a reset and have not lost a single satoshi of test funds (which is not to say it is fully hardened quite yet). At this point, we hope and believe that this is the last update in this round of testnet, which will allow us to get back to focusing on the mainnet release and not asking those testing to update until we are very close to a mainnet release.Once more, we will ask that you shut down the old version now, and we will restart the notarizations and transaction flow between Ethereum and Verus at 5 AM UTC time.Thank you to everyone who helped with all the testing and exposing of issues that enabled us to make maybe even inconveniently quick progress.If you miss the fork for this version at the above time you can get back on the correct chain by stopping Verus and deleting deleting everything other than your wallet.dat file in your data directory at:\n- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest`## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n  ```",
