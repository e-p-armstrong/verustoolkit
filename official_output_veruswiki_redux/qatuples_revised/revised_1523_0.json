    "What are some limitations of using a single public/private key pair for digital identity management, as seen in Bitcoin and its derivatives?",
    "Using a single public/private key pair for digital identity management, as seen in Bitcoin and its derivatives, lacks critical capabilities, including:\n\n1. Recovery from loss or theft of private keys\n2. Friendly name aliases\n3. Modifiable multi-sig signing\n4. Updates\n5. Privacy\n6. Association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity\n\nThese limitations make it unsuitable for use as a comprehensive digital identity solution.",
    "Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables. It is also the foundation upon which many new applications and additional capabilities can be built.",
