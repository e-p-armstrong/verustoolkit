    "Why do some antivirus software flag Verus as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"? Is Verus malware?",
    "No, Verus is not malware. Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag Verus as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software. This is a warning that you are installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, this is a false positive, and Verus is a legitimate software.",
