    "What is the purpose of a mandatory mainnet upgrade in Verus?",
    "A mandatory mainnet upgrade in Verus is necessary to correct errors or vulnerabilities in the network that could cause issues with cross-chain challenges. In this case, a numeric function used in cross-chain challenges was incorrect and needed to be updated to ensure the integrity of the network. The upgrade is necessary to prevent potential failures of cross-chain challenges and blockages of bridges.",

This had never been hit, as it would have been calculated incorrectly only if multiple chains experienced a challenge of two competing forks, but in that case, it would falsely reject any challenge proof. That would mean cross-chain challenges on mainnet, even though they were fine and fully tested on testnet, could fail and block a bridge until that calculation was made correct and the network upgraded.",
