    "What is the Verus Fee Pool and Rewards system, and how does it work?",
    "The Verus Fee Pool and Rewards system is a unique technology that goes live with PBaaS. When users perform transactions, such as cross-chain operations, DeFi activities, or ID registrations, the fees are collected in an on-chain \"fee pool\". Miners or stakers then take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward. This incentive structure ensures that validators prioritize transactions based on fees, while preventing them from manipulating the fee system for personal gain.",
    "6) **The Verus Fee Pool and Rewards**: Another technology and solution unique to Verus, the Verus Fee Pool technology goes live with PBaaS. What this means is that as people use the cross-chain, DeFi, or purchase/register IDs on the network, the miner or staker will put all fees into the on-chain \u201cfee pool\u201d, and then take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward. This gives everyone incentive to still prioritize transactions based on fees, while preventing validators from gaming the fee system by washing fees-in vs. fees-out or working to reorg/rewind to capture a particularly juicy block reward. Instead, this technology aligns all validator incentives with the health/proper operation of the network and creates a circular on-chain economy that can last well beyond block rewards.For those who actually understand the challenges actual users have in crypto today, this release represents a historic move forward in public cryptographic networks and credibly and actually neutral infrastructure for society-wide human and AI collaboration and learning. As a community, this version really does realize the vision laid out in the original Verus Vision Paper, and at the same time provides much more than was described there. We are a community of individuals, and it is only because that is what we are that we have all arrived here together. The rest of the world is stuck on their Munchausen\u2019s protocols, trying to figure out how to share the front-running and back-running spoils taken from users, but Verus activation gives them a better path forward.",
