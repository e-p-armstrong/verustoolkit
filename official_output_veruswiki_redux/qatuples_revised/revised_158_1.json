    "What is the purpose of the Verus ID technology?",
    "Verus ID is a blockchain identity technology that provides a solution to the fundamental problems of decentralized, censorship-resistant public systems. It provides quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities. This technology allows for a single friendly name to be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer.",

If you lose your keys, no one will ever be able to recover your money.In fact, trading off decentralized, censorship resistant public systems for this risk to your cryptocurrency assets is such a fundamental issue in blockchain systems today that it is considered an acceptable price for having the benefit of full control over your own funds and blockchain assets.Verus ID provides an elegant solution to these previously unsolved, fundamental problems, and also provides quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities that provide the following advantages over today\u2019s blockchain systems:1.
