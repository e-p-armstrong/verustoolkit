    "What is the significance of the v1.0.0 release of Verus PBaaS?",
    "The v1.0.0 release of Verus PBaaS is a major upgrade that delivers on the vision and goals outlined in the vision paper of June 2018. It enables a wide range of capabilities, including cross-chain, DeFi AMMs, decentralized markets, self-sovereign provable recoverable IDs, NFT capabilities, anti-phishing, anti-MEV, and scalability.",
    "**The result will be true if the signature is valid.**\n```\ntrue\n```\n## v1.0.0\nAnnouncing v1.0.0 - PBaaS Mainnet Upgrade, UPGRADE TO v1.0.0-x MANDATORY FOR CONTINUED MAINNET AND TESTNET USE AFTER MAY 21, 2023, EXPECTED BLOCK #2546600### What\u2019s New\nThis release delivers on every part of the vision (and most stretch goals) either described in the vision paper of June 2018 or ever planned for the PBaaS release. Thanks to the incredible combined efforts of so many people in the community ranging from development, companies and projects joining and their open contributions (Valu/Arkeytyp, CHIPS, vDEX, VaultAlert, cragslist, and more) to community members supporting users to helping educate others who can contribute as well, we have run these protocols now for years as we\u2019ve improved them, and all of these capabilities will go live on the Verus mainnet May 21, 2023, with the activation expected targeting block 2546600.As a community, we\u2019ve discussed what the Verus PBaaS protocol can do for years. Now that it has existed on testnet for as long as it has, only those who have either been part of those conversations or experienced it first hand have a real sense for how much better Verus PBaaS is as a solution for cross-chain, DeFi AMMs, decentralized markets, self-sovereign provable recoverable IDs, NFT capabilities, anti-phishing, anti-MEV, scale, or just about any of the challenges people have on crypto platforms today. In fact, as we prepare for activation of this protocol that enables so many new use cases for crypto, not to mention easy onboarding when entrepreneurs discover how to really leverage VerusIDs, PBaaS is so far beyond what people are experiencing on any crypto platform today that it has been easy to dismiss our community as describing the impossible.",
