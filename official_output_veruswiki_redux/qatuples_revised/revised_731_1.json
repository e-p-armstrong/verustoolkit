    "How does the protocol improvement in v0.9.5-1 make the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol more resistant to multi-block attempts at MEV?",
    "The protocol improvement makes the following adjustments:\n\n1. Conversions and cross-chain transfers still roll-up into exports that are collected from one or more blocks of transfer transactions.\n2. A random bit is pulled from later blocks to determine when a block is the last of the prior export or first in the next.\n3. The last miner or staker to complete a block of an export retroactively receives 10% of all fees from processing that export, including all conversions.\n4. Import transactions can now include up to n/2 arbitrage transactions, where n is the number of reserves in a liquidity basket currency.\n\nThese changes disincentivize miners or stakers from attempting to exclude a large set of transactions from a block and front run all of them, as they will have an even chance of having all of those excluded transactions put back in with their transaction, turning potential gain into potential loss.",
    "For testnet, v0.9.5-1 fixes an issue discovered on testnet where duplicate ID exports blocked cross-chain processing temporarily and also introduces a protocol improvement designed to make the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol even more resistant than what we believe was already the leading algorithm to multi-block attempts at MEV. The protocol change makes the following adjustments:Conversions and cross-chain transfers still roll-up into exports that are collected from one or more blocks of transfer transactions, but to determine when a block is the last of the prior export or first in the next requires a random bit pulled from later blocks.\nThe last miner or staker to complete a block of an export retroactively receives 10% of all fees from processing that export, including all conversions, once the rollup is processed as an import. This reward used to go to the miner or staker who processes the export, which is no longer the case.\nImport transactions can now include up to n/2 arbitrage transactions, where n is the number of reserves in a liquidity basket currency.These changes together serve to disincentivize any miner or staker from attempting to exclude a large set of transactions from a block and front run all of them, as they will have an even chance of having all of those excluded transactions put back in with their transaction, turning potential gain into potential loss. They would be better off saving their working capital to arbitrage imports by joining transactions, bringing them close to market, and earning money without risk of loss. In addition, if they do end up putting more value of transactions in a block that caps the export rollup, they will reliably earn meaningful rewards without risk of loss in that way as well.",
