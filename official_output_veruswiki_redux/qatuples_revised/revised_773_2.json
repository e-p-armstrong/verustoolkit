    "How can I get a hex-encoded proof that a transaction was included in a block using the Verus command-line interface?",
    "To get a hex-encoded proof that a transaction was included in a block, you can use the `gettxoutproof` command in the Verus command-line interface. The command is:\n```\n> verus gettxoutproof [\"txid\",...] [blockhash]\n```\nReplace `[\"txid\",...]` with a JSON array of transaction IDs, and `[blockhash]` with the block hash of the block that contains the transaction. The command will return a hex-encoded proof that the transaction was included in the block.",
    "Get unspent transactions\n```bash\n> verus listunspent\n```\nView the details\n```bash\n> verus gettxout \"txid\" 1\n```\nAs a json rpc call\n```bash\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"gettxout\", \"params\": [\"txid\", 1] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```## `gettxoutproof [\"txid\",...] ( blockhash )`\nReturns a hex-encoded proof that \"txid\" was included in a block.NOTE: By default this function only works sometimes. This is when there is an\nunspent output in the utxo for this transaction. To make it always work,\nyou need to maintain a transaction index, using the -txindex command line option or\nspecify the block in which the transaction is included in manually (by blockhash).Return the raw transaction data.#### Arguments:\n```json\n1. \"txids\"    (string) A json array of txids to filter\n  [\n   \"txid\"   (string) A transaction hash\n   ,...\n  ]\n```\n2. \"block hash\" (string, optional) If specified, looks for txid in the block with this hash#### Result:\n```\n\"data\"      (string) A string that is a serialized, hex-encoded data for the proof.\n```### `gettxoutsetinfo`\nReturns statistics about the unspent transaction output set.\nNote this call may take some time.",
