    "What is required for DeFi and cross-chain functions to be re-enabled in Verus?",
    "The network needs to upgrade to version 1.0.6 before DeFi and cross-chain functions can be re-enabled, which will also enable the launch of the ETH bridge and PBaaS conversions.",
    "The lesson here is that if you\u2019re interested to learn about a basket currency, pay attention to the total reserve ratio, what currencies are in it, and see that there is enough liquidity of reserves and holder distribution for the basket to make sense. Of course baskets could be memes, but they also have real function. Make sure you take a look into how a basket works and that you have a reason before putting your hard mined, staked, won, or purchased Verus in.We will need the network to upgrade to version 1.0.6 before we can re-enable DeFi and cross-chain functions, making the ETH bridge launch possible, as well as PBaaS launches and conversions.We see that someone is launching a currency called \u201cwhales\u201d, which looks like an ID registration currency that will enable registering IDs with 3 levels of referrals in a currency that simply collects registration fees, which may start quite reasonably priced and likely get more expensive over time as fees are earned in the basket. The startblock for whales is 2561900, which should happen somewhere around 6:00 UTC on Thursday. That means that if we can upgrade and activate by Tuesday before the meeting, that person would still have time for pre-launch participation by those who would like.Thanks everyone for upgrading as soon as you are able!### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
