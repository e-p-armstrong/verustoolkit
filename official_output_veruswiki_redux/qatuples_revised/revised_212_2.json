The issue fixed by this update does not expose any funds to theft or counterfeit, but it does fix a vulnerability that an attacker may exploit to probe for information regarding a specific node's control over private keys. Since the issue resolved does not put funds directly at risk, this update is considered CRITICAL, not mandatory. We recommended that all users upgrade to this version of the Verus CLI or GUI wallet immediately and discontinue use of previous wallets.# Notable Changes\n- Integrated Zcash updates from Sapling release to 2.0.7-3\n- Added Sprout to Sapling upgrade API\n- Including support for PBaaS multi-chain test network with permissionless blockchain launches, reserve currency conversion protocols, merge mining, and easy cross-chain transactions.",
