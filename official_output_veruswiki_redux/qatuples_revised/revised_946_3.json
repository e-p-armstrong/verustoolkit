    "What is the purpose of the `options` argument when defining a currency in Verus?",
    "The `options` argument in Verus is used to specify various properties of a currency, such as whether it allows fractional reserve conversion, requires permissions for ID creation, or is a token rather than a native currency. It is an integer value that can be set using bitwise operators to enable or disable various features.",
    "To create a currency of any kind, the identity it is named after must be minted on the blockchain on which the currency is created.\nOnce a currency is activated for an identity name, the same symbol may not be reused for another currency or blockchain, even if the identity is transferred, revoked or recovered, unless there is an endblock specified and the currency or blockchain has deactivated as of that end block.All funds to start the currency and for initial conversion amounts must be available to spend from the identity with the same name and ID as the currency being defined.#### Arguments:\n```json\n{\n  \"options\" : n,         (int, optional) bits (in hexadecimal):\n                     OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1         // (1 decimal )allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set\n                     OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2         // (2 decimal) clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID\n                     OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4         // (4 decimal) all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking\n                     OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8        // (8 decimal) if set, this chain supports referrals\n                     OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 0x10   // (16 decimal) if set, this chain requires referrals\n                     OPTION_TOKEN = 0x20          // (32 decimal) if set, this is a token, not a native currency\n                     OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 0x40      // (64 decimal) for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency\n                     OPTION_GATEWAY = 0x80         // (128 decimal) if set, this routes external currencies\n    ",
