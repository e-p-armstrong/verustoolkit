    "How do I use the `verifyfile` command to verify a downloaded Verus package?",
    "You can use the `verifyfile` command to verify a downloaded Verus package by providing the signer's identity, signature, and the path to the file. For example:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AfmaIQABQR8yN3LyVymt/ZRYvyuGTma3rEbxFshyLOa3zI5qAXTaz34gxj30QXiluQ5TJJ7jxQwJaLUl6bJLMvfNvlzI+KBw\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.4-3-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.4-3-x86_64.tar.gz\"\n```\nThe command will return `true` if the signature is valid.",
