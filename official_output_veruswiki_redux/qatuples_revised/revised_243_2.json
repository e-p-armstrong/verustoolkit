    "How can I send reserve to another chain and convert a coin from reserve to that chain's native currency at the current market price?",
    "You can send reserve to another chain and convert a coin from reserve to that chain's native currency at the current market price by using the `sendreserve` command with the `tonative` option:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```\n\nThis command will send the specified amount of reserve to the specified address on the new chain and automatically convert it to the native currency of that chain at the current market price.",
