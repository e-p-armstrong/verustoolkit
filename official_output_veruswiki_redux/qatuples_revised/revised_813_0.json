    "## Verus PBaaS and DeFi RC5 - BUG BOUNTIES\nAt this time, we are not aware of any bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross chain protocols on this version of testnet. We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all of the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release. While we don\u2019t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended. If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.## Emoji IDs and \ud83c\udf83Chain\nIn the spirit of this release day, we have taken advantage of VerusIDs and currency emoji support and created a new, merge mineable PBaaS chain, \ud83c\udf83. It has been said that those who merge mine \ud83c\udf83chain at midnight will disappear into the crypto-metaverse, never to be seen again, become VerusID avatars, and be forever doomed to being bought and sold on the VRSCTEST marketplace for all eternity (or until the next testnet reset). YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!",
