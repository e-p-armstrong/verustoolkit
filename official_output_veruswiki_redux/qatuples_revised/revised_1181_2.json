    "How can I generate a new shielded address for receiving payments in Verus?",
    "You can generate a new shielded address for receiving payments in Verus using the `z_getnewaddress` command. By default, it returns a Sapling address, but you can specify a different type of address, such as Sprout, by providing the type as an argument. For example, `verus z_getnewaddress sapling`.",
    "CAUTION: If the wallet has only an incoming viewing key for this address, then spends cannot be\ndetected, and so the returned balance may be larger than the actual balance.#### Arguments:\n1. \"address\"    (string) The selected address. It may be a transparent or private address and\n          include \"z\\*\" \"R\\*\" and \"i\\*\" wildcards.
