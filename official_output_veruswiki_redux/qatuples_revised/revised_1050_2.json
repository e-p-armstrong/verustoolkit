    "How can I use the Bridge.vETH currency?",
    "You can use the Bridge.vETH currency to provide liquidity while holding Bridge.vETH, a 100% backed basket of three currencies of balanced relative value, or to pass through and convert currencies between Verus, Ethereum, USDC, and Bridge.vETH. You can access it from Metamask on Goerli, from the Verus CLI or GUI on the vrsctest chain, or from CLI/GUI on other PBaaS chains.",
    "After the Ethereum bridge has been defined, you will be able to send currencies over to Verus testnet from Ethereum\u2019s Goerli network and also participate in the launch of the Ethereum bridge liquidity basket with VETH, USDC, or VRSCTEST by using `sendcurrency` with `\u201cpreconvert\u201d:true` on the command line or through the GUI. We recommend that you get some Goerli ETH using this facet or others (https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/), which will make your experience of all Verus PBaaS can offer a bit more well rounded when the Ethereum bridge is available once again.Once the Goerli Ethereum liquidity basket (Bridge.vETH) activates on testnet, which is a 100% backed basket composed of 1/3rd each of Verus, Ethereum, and USDC (all testnet tokens), you can use it from Metamask on Goerli, from the Verus CLI or GUI on the vrsctest chain, or from CLI/GUI on other PBaaS chains to provide liquidity while holding Bridge.vETH, a 100% backed basket of three currencies of balanced relative value, or to pass through and convert currencies between Verus, Ethereum, USDC, and Bridge.vETH.The Brige.vETH currency also coordinates with the vETH@ gateway and enables registering `*.veth@` IDs for $5 worth of Bridge.vETH, based on its internal USDC conversion price at the time of registration. When you register `*.veth@` IDs, 0.02 VRSCTEST goes to miners and stakers, and $5 worth of Bridge.vETH is burned, reducing the total supply of Bridge.vETH for everyone without reducing reserves, and contributing to the relative value, \u201creal yield\u201d of Bridge.vETH, relative to its three reserve currencies. This is the way that all decentralized, fractional currencies which enable ID registration accept registration fees, equally benefiting all fractional currency holders/liquidity providers when IDs are registered, while providing Verus miners and stakers the identity import fee of 0.02 VRSC.",
