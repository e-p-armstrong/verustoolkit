    "What might cause errors when running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution like Debian or Devuan?",
    "The errors might be caused by missing dependencies that are not installed by default on the Linux distribution. Specifically, the `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries might be required but not present.",
    "# error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory\n# error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory\n\nWhen running `./verusd` on a Linux distro (eg Debian or Devuan), not all dependencies may be installed by default, resulting in the errormessage `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` or `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory`.\n\nTo solve this you need to install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries:\n`sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`\n\nSolution supplied by: Oink.vrsc@\n\nNote: revision date 2021-12-01.",
