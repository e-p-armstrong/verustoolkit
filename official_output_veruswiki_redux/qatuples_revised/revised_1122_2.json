    "What is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what are its capabilities?",
    "The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a decentralized network that allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. It enables:\n\n1. Public blockchains: available for merge mining and staking, accessible to the world.\n2. Private blockchains: easy to set up, with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization's internal private network and back.\n3. Unlimited scalability: there is no limit to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n4. Decentralized bridge confirmation: provided by Notary IDs, specified at chain definition.",
    "in, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain networ",
