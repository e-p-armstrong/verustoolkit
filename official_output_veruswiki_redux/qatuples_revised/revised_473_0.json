    "What innovation does Verus bring to cross-chain bridging of blockchain networks?",
    "Verus enables cryptographically provable, cross-chain bridging across Verus and all PBaaS and other connected blockchains in the network, either combined with or independent of the need for notary witnesses. This technology is referred to as \"auto-notarization\" or \"Proof of Proof of Power\".",
    "4. **Bridging Blockchain Networks Without Witnesses**: v0.9.9 is the first release of any blockchain protocol anywhere that we know of which enables cryptographically provable, cross-chain bridging across Verus and all PBaaS and other connected blockchains in the network, either combined with or independent of the need for notary witnesses. With notary witnesses, cross-chain transactions complete faster, but they are also checked against cryptographic evidence, making it difficult to impossible for anyone, including notary witnesses to take any action, even colluding with validators that would go against the wishes of the most chain power. We have been referring to this new cross-chain consensus technology as \u201cauto-notarization\u201d, as that is what it actually is, but it would also be accurate to call it Proof of Proof of Power, as that is how it works. For purposes of ensuring everyone understands the state of the technology, it is fully functional and we have taken great care to ensure it is sufficiently secure, but we have not yet had the protocol proven to an academic standard. Because of that, while it provides a security fall-back against misbehaving notary witnesses and will be fully functional and we believe sufficiently secure without notary witnesses on release, we currently recommend toconsider the protocol unproven at this time and that any serious PBaaS chains be launched with operational notary witnesses until further notice.",
