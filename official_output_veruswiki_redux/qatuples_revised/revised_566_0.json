    "How do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on Verus?",
    "To sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on Verus, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction using `sendcurrency` with the multi-signature ID and get the raw transaction data.\n2. Use `z_getoperationstatus` to get the operation ID and raw hex transaction data.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and use `signrawtransaction` to sign the transaction.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using `sendrawtransaction`.",
    "## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)\nCreate transaction, get raw transaction data:\n ```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\nTake the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:\n ```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:\n ```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```## Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):\nThe currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```## Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent\n`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration",
