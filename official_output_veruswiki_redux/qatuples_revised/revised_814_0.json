    "How can I register a name commitment in Verus using the command line?",
    "You can register a name commitment in Verus using the `registernamecommitment` command. The syntax for this command is:\n\n`registernamecommitment \"name\" \"controladdress\" (\"referralidentity\") (\"parentnameorid\") (\"sourceoffunds\")`\n\nThis command registers a name commitment, which is a required step before registering an identity. The name commitment hides the actual name while ensuring that miners cannot front-run the name registration unless they have also registered a name commitment for the same name.",

The name commitment hides the name itself while ensuring that the miner who mines in the registration cannot front-run the name unless they have also registered a name commitment for the same name or are willing to forfeit the offer of payment for the chance that a commitment made now will allow them to register the name in the future.",
