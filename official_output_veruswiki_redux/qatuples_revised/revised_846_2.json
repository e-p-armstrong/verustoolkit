    "Will setting a timelock on a VerusID affect its lock status on other chains?",
    "No, setting a timelock on a VerusID will only affect the lock status of that specific ID on the current blockchain. It will not affect the lock status of the same ID on other chains, including chains that the ID has been exported to.",
    "### `setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\":absoluteblockheight || \"setunlockdelay\":numberofblocksdelayafterunlock}' (returntx) (feeoffer) (sourceoffunds)`\nEnables timelocking and unlocking of funds access for an on-chain VerusID. This does not affect the lock status of VerusIDs on other chains,\nincluding VerusIDs with the same identity as this one, which has been exported to another chain.Use \"setunlockdelay\" to set a time unlock delay on an identity, which means that once the identity has been unlocked,\nnumberofblocksdelayafterunlock must then pass before the identity will be able to spend funds on this blockchain. Services\nwhich support VerusID authentication and recognize this setting may also choose to prevent funds transfers when an ID is locked.Use \"unlockatblock\" to either unlock, by passing the current block, which will still require waiting for the specified unlock\ndelay, or to set a future unlock height that immediately begins counting down. Unlike an unlock delay, which only starts counting\ndown when the ID is unlocked, an \"unlockatblock\" time lock is absolute and will automatically unlock when the specified\nblock passes.",
