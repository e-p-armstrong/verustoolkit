    "What information does the `getchaintips` command provide about the blockchain?",
    "The `getchaintips` command returns an array of objects, each containing information about a chain tip, including:\n1. The height of the chain tip (as a numeric value).\n2. The block hash of the tip (as a string).\n3. The branch length (as a numeric value), which is zero for the main chain.\n4. The status of the chain (as a string), which can be \"active\", \"invalid\", \"headers-only\", \"valid-headers\", or \"valid-fork\".",
    "#### Result:\n```json\n[\n {\n  \"height\": xxxx,     (numeric) height of the chain tip\n  \"hash\": \"xxxx\",     (string) block hash of the tip\n  \"branchlen\": 0     (numeric) zero for main chain\n  \"status\": \"active\"   (string) \"active\" for the main chain\n },\n {\n  \"height\": xxxx,\n  \"hash\": \"xxxx\",\n  \"branchlen\": 1     (numeric) length of branch connecting the tip to the main chain\n  \"status\": \"xxxx\"    (string) status of the chain (active, valid-fork, valid-headers, headers-only, invalid)\n }\n]\n```\nPossible values for status:\n1. \"invalid\"        This branch contains at least one invalid block\n2. \"headers-only\"     Not all blocks for this branch are available, but the headers are valid\n3. \"valid-headers\"     All blocks are available for this branch, but they were never fully validated\n4. \"valid-fork\"      This branch is not part of the active chain, but is fully validated\n5. \"active\"        This is the tip of the active main chain, which is certainly validExamples:\n```bash\n> verus getchaintips\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getchaintips\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```### `getchaintxstats`Compute statistics about the total number and rate of transactions in the chain.#### Arguments:\n1. nblocks  (numeric, optional) Number of blocks in averaging window.\n2. blockhash (string, optional) The hash of the block which ends the window.",
