    "Where is the Linux version of Verus Desktop stored, and how does it work?",
    "The Linux version of Verus Desktop is supplied as an AppImage, which means it doesn't get installed, but instead is mounted in the `/tmp` folder when executed. The mounted folder will have a name like `.mount_Verus-xxxxx`, where the `xxxxx` part is a random set of characters that changes on every start of the wallet. This folder is hidden, and you can toggle its display by pressing `<CTRL>-H`.",
    "# Standard file location for Verus Desktop\n\nThe Linux version of Verus Desktop is supplied as an AppImage, so it does not get installed, but mounted in the `/tmp` folder on execution.\nThe folder it is mounted to will look like `.mount_Verus-xxxxx` where the `xxxxx` part will be a random set of characters, changing on every start of the wallet.\n(It is a hidden folder: in order to see it, `<CTRL>-H` will toggle the display of hidden folders)\n\nNormally you don't need to worry about these locations, but in some instances you will be asked by community members providing support to look up a file in a folder in your Verus-Desktop installation.\n\nnote: changing files in these folders or subfolders may result in a corrupt installation. Only do so when instructed by our support community members.\n\n## Deamons\n\nThe daemons are located in the `komodod`, `verusd` and `zcashd` folders that can be found in the\n`resources/app/assets/bin/linux64` subfolder of your (mounted) program folder.\n\n## Program settings\n\nVerus Desktop saves it program settings on a different folder:\n`~/.verus-desktop`\nThe users settings are stored in `appdata/config.json` in the program settings folder.\n\n## Standard chain data and wallet locations\n\n#### KMD\n\n`~/.komodo`\n\n### Verus\n\n`~/.komodo/VRSC`\n\n#### Komodo asset chains\nAny Komodo asset chain will create a subfolder in the KMD chain data and wallet folder, which is standard named. The names will be in capitals and are identical to the **official** asset-chain name.\n`~/.komodo/<CHAIN-NAME>`\n\nNote: examples\nPirate: `~/.komodo/PIRATE`\nUtrum: `~/.komodo/OOT`\nZexo: `~/.komodo/ZEXO`\nAnd so on...\n\nFor easy access to the binaries folders, Verus-Desktop program settings and VRSC chain folder and all binary folders, you can use the debug menu in Verus-Desktop.\n\nnote: created at 2020-12-03 by Oink.vrsc@",
