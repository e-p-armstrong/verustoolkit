    "What does the `zcrawreceive` command do, and what is its output?",
    "The `zcrawreceive` command decrypts the `encryptednote` and checks if the coin commitments are in the blockchain as indicated by the \"exists\" result. The output is a JSON object containing the amount, note plaintext, and exists.",
    "Note: The caller is responsible for delivering the output enc1 and enc2 to the appropriate recipients, as well as signing rawtxout and ensuring it is mined. (A future RPC call will deliver the confidential payments in-band on the blockchain.)\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n\"encryptednote1\": enc1,\n\"encryptednote2\": enc2,\n\"rawtxn\": rawtxout\n}\n```\n\n### `zcrawkeygen`\nDEPRECATED. Generate a zcaddr which can send and receive confidential values.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n \"zcaddress\": zcaddr,\n \"zcsecretkey\": zcsecretkey,\n \"zcviewingkey\": zcviewingkey,\n}\n```\n\n### `zcrawreceive zcsecretkey encryptednote`\nDEPRECATED. Decrypts encryptednote and checks if the coin commitments\nare in the blockchain as indicated by the \"exists\" result.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n \"amount\": value,\n \"note\": noteplaintext,\n \"exists\": exists\n}\n```\n\n### `zcsamplejoinsplit`\nPerform a joinsplit and return the JSDescription.\n\ncompiled by Oink.vrsc@, additions by Mike@, grewalsatinder@ and allbits@\n\nNote: last revision date 2024-05-03.",
