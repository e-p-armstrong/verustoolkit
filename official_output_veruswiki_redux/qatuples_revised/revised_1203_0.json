    "How does Verus limit the number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging?",
    "The number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging can be limited by the caller. The transparent limit parameter can be set to control this. If the transparent limit parameter is set to zero, the number of UTXOs is limited based on the size of the transaction, but only after Overwinter has activated. Before Overwinter, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option determines the number of UTXOs.",
    "The number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging can be limited by the caller. If the transparent limit parameter is set to zero, and Overwinter is not yet active, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option will determine the number of UTXOs. After Overwinter has activated `-mempooltxinputlimit` is ignored and having a transparent input limit of zero will mean limit the number of UTXOs based on the size of the transaction. Any limit is constrained by the consensus rule defining a maximum transaction size of 100000 bytes before Sapling, and 2000000 bytes once Sapling activates.",
