    "What other improvements are mentioned besides the Cheat Catcher and Stake Delegation?",
    "Yes, there are two other improvements mentioned: timing improvements for more efficient staking, and improved support for synchronizing with non-VRSC KMD-family coins.",
    "### Cheat Catcher\nIn addition to Stake Guard, which supports the nothing at stake solution, this version of Verus includes an early, functional version of the Cheat Catcher, a system that enables every miner or staker to catch stake cheating, when someone stakes two blocks with the same coins on two or more forks. With this version, all known orphaned stake transactions are compared to successful stakes when they mature, and if the orphan was trying to stake the exact same coins but on a different fork and the real fork at the same time, the miner of the block that is 100 blocks later, when that coinbase matures, will mine or stake a spend transaction for that cheat into the block, and send it to a sapling address the miner or staker has set in their wallet. If your wallet catches and spends a cheat transaction the reward for that coinbase will be automatically shielded to your address at the same time as you win the block. The early Cheat Catcher does not broadcast cheating transactions, and it will not catch all possible cheats on the network. It will make it a statistically losing proposition to cheat. This means you should not stake the same addresses on more than one computer at a time. Doing so creates the possibility that you will stake on two forks with the same coins, which puts your earnings at risk. Future cheat catcher implementations will excel at catching cheats on the network.### Stake Delegation\nIn the new Verus network protocol that activates at the same time as Sapling, you can now set the parameter -pubkey in the command line wallet, which will redirect both mining AND staking rewards to the public key of an address, which can be obtained from an address with the \u201cvalidatekey\u201d command.- Timing improvements for more efficient staking\n- Improved support for synchronizing with non-VRSC KMD-family coins\n- Non-mandatory",
