    "What is StakeGuard, and what problem does it solve?",
    "StakeGuard is a technology that solves the nothing-at-stake problem on the Verus network. It is enabled by the Verus-enhanced Crypto-conditions technology.",
    "### Sapling\nVerus Coin 0.4.0 includes support for Sapling addresses and transactions, including memory usage reduction of near 98% and performance improvements over previous z-transactions typically 40-50x. As with Zcash Sapling upgrade rules, older \u201cSprout\u201d addresses and \u201cSapling\u201d addresses may not be mixed in the same transaction. That means if you have Verus Coin that you would like to move from an older Sprout z-address to a Sapling z-address, you must first send it to a transparent address, then to the Sapling z-address. Sapling addresses can be used for shielding coinbase transactions or other functions. Retrieving viewing keys for Sapling addresses, which is not required for normal transactions, is not yet supported, and will be included in the next Sapling technology update.### Crypto-conditions and StakeGuard\nVerus-enhanced, Komodo crypto-condition technology, enabling smart transactions and new types of on-chain functionalities. Verus has enhanced the original crypto-condition technology to make integration with standard transactions easier and enable things like StakeGuard, the Verus nothing-at-stake solution. In later releases, the same technology will enable PBaaS, voting, identity capabilities, and more.",
