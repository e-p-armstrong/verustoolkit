    "What is the significance of the `getidentityhistory` and `getidentitycontent` APIs in the context of L1 VerusID APIs, and how can they be used by applications?",
    "The `getidentityhistory` and `getidentitycontent` APIs provide real-time mempool access and introduce self-sovereign delete operations to identity content, making it easy for applications to index, organize, and aggregate an unlimited amount of user content referenced by an identity and made available to the application. These APIs can be used by applications to manage and utilize identity-related data in a more efficient and flexible manner.",
    "Using `\u201cnotarizationprotocol\u201d:1`, which is also the default, a chain launch can specify notary witnesses that will be used when they do their job. Even if they stop witnessing for any reason, the protocol will fail-over to auto-notarization, ensuring that cross-chain transactions still function as expected, even if just for people to move their assets to another blockchain, although significantly more slowly and based solely on cryptographic proof and challenge resolution between merge miners and stakers. This cross-chain proof and challenge protocol operates even when witnesses are also operating and if miners and stakers continue to prove a more powerful chain than the one witnesses represent, the most powerful chain can still be confirmed. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**5. **Expanding L1 VerusID APIs**: This release provides a major enhancement to the identity content multimap support with two new APIs, `getidentityhistory` and `getidentitycontent` that provide real-time mempool access and also introduce self-sovereign delete operations to identity content that can be used by applications, making it easy for applications to index, organize, and aggregate an unlimited amount of user content referenced by an identity and made available to the application. This is the technology we used for oracle upgrade notifications, as all of this is available at L1, making it possible to imagine future protocols that can deal smoothly with diverse community opinions worldwide, but always respect the sovereignty and decisions of all members on the network. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**",
