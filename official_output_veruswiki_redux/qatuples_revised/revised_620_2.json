    "What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does it work?",
    "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. Users can advertise their offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, allowing users to pay or offer to pay from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, which are still auditable by the user. The platform also allows owners to select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership.",
