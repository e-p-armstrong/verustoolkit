    "What features are available for crowdfunding currency launches on Verus?",
    "Verus provides several features for crowdfunding currency launches, including:\n\n* Minimum participation requirements: Set a minimum level of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimum is not met by the start time of your blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees.\n* Maximum participation limits: Set a maximum participation limit in one or more currencies.\n* Pre-launch discounts: Offer discounts to early participants.\n* Price-neutral pre-allocations: Allocate funds to select IDs, increasing the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies.\n* Price-neutral carve-outs: Carve out proceeds for specific purposes.\n* Vesting schedules: Include vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs.",
