    "What is the Verus import/export protocol, and what benefits does it provide?",
    "The Verus import/export protocol is a technology that enables easy integration with other blockchains. It makes it possible to provably and seamlessly move assets between Verus and other blockchain networks, such as Ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens. This allows for the creation of bridges that can automatically send and receive tokens between Verus and other networks.",
    "# The Best Way to Launch a Currency\nCurrency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!Currencies can be launched to accept a range of other currencies and with or without fractional reserve capabilities. Verus import/export protocol was designed to make integration with other block chains provable and easy, and there are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, where currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network, and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.# Preparing for Multi-chain, Dynamic Merge Mining\nWhile this 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology which was running on testnet last year. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies as well.## Sending and Converting Currency\n**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**",
