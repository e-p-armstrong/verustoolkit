    "What is the purpose of the `addmergedblock` command in Verus?",
    "The `addmergedblock` command adds a fully prepared block and its header to the current merge mining queue of the Verus daemon. It allows you to control what happens if adding the block would exceed the available merge mining slots. By default, if adding the block would exceed the available space, the daemon will replace the choice with the least ROI if the new block provides more.",
