    "What special strings can be used inside the `fromaddresses` array, and what do they do?",
    "The special strings \"ANY_TADDR\", \"ANY_SPROUT\", and \"ANY_SAPLING\" can be used inside the `fromaddresses` array. These strings allow you to merge UTXOs or notes from all t-addrs, Sprout zaddrs, or Sapling zaddrs belonging to the wallet, respectively.",
    "#### Arguments:\n1. fromaddresses     (array, required) A JSON array with addresses.\n             The following special strings are accepted inside the array:\n               - \"ANY_TADDR\":  Merge UTXOs from any t-addrs belonging to the wallet.\n               - \"ANY_SPROUT\": Merge notes from any Sprout zaddrs belonging to the wallet.\n               - \"ANY_SAPLING\": Merge notes from any Sapling zaddrs belonging to the wallet.\n             While it is possible to use a variety of different combinations of addresses and the above values,\n             it is not possible to send funds from both sprout and sapling addresses simultaneously. If a special\n             string is given, any given addresses of that type will be counted as duplicates and cause an error.\n```json\n  [\n   \"address\"     (string) Can be a t-addr or a zaddr\n   ,...\n  ]\n```\n2. \"toaddress\"      (string, required) The t-addr or zaddr to send the funds to.\n3. fee          (numeric, optional, default=0.0001) The fee amount to attach to this transaction.\n4. transparent_limit   (numeric, optional, default=50) Limit on the maximum number of UTXOs to merge. Set to 0 to use node option -mempooltxinputlimit (before Overwinter), or as many as will fit in the transaction (after Overwinter).\n5. shielded_limit    (numeric, optional, default=20 Sprout or 200 Sapling Notes) Limit on the maximum number of notes to merge. Set to 0 to merge as many as will fit in the transaction.\n6. \"memo\"        (string, optional) Encoded as hex. When toaddress is a zaddr, this will be stored in the memo field of the new note.",
