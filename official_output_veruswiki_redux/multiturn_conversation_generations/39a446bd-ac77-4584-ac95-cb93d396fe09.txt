    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    Yes, actually. If I run `./verusd` and encounter the errors I mentioned earlier,

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    How do fees generated on a new blockchain created using Verus work? Do they go
    back to the Verus blockchain?


    **ANSWER:**

    Fees generated on a new blockchain created using Verus are earned on the new blockchain
    itself, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This means that the new
    blockchain has full control over its own fees, and they are not shared with the
    Verus blockchain.



    **QUESTION:**

    What happens if a blockchain currency launch does not meet the required minimum
    levels of worldwide participation?


    **ANSWER:**

    If a blockchain currency launch does not meet the required minimum levels of worldwide
    participation, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions,
    minus the network fees. This ensures that participants are protected in case the
    launch is not successful.



    **QUESTION:**

    What kind of features are available for blockchain currency launches on Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    Verus offers a range of features for blockchain currency launches, including the
    ability to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation, maximum participation
    limits, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, vesting
    schedules, and more. These features provide flexibility and customization options
    for launching new blockchain currencies.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what are its benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a decentralized network that
    allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. This
    network enables the creation of public blockchains available for merge mining
    and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can be easily set up
    and bridged with public currencies. The benefits of this network include unlimited
    scale, interoperability between blockchains, and ease of use for creating new
    blockchains and bridging currencies.



    **QUESTION:**

    Are there any limitations to the number of blockchains that can operate on the
    Verus network?


    **ANSWER:**

    No, there is no limit to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate
    and interoperate on the Verus network. While there may be some overhead for cross-notarization,
    the Verus network is designed to support an unlimited number of blockchains.'
