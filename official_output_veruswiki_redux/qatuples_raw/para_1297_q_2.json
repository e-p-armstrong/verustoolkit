    "What is Verus Vault technology, and how does it enhance VerusIDs?",
    "Verus Vault technology is an advanced time lock capability that extends the features of VerusIDs, which are already revocable, recoverable, and provable blockchain addresses and identities. With Verus Vault, users can implement features like vesting, trusts, and theft-proofing funds, while still allowing for staking on locked funds. This enables self-sovereign management of funds, identity, and estate planning, with added security against lost or stolen private keys.",
    "- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.",
