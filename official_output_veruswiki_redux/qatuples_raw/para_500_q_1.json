    "What are some additional capabilities of Verus?",
    "Verus has several additional capabilities, including:\n\n1. On-chain launches of token, centralized currency, and liquidity basket AMMs.\n2. On-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming.\n3. On-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles.",
    "We will leave the current testnet running and fully functional, as we prepare the next release, which we expect to be ready for a mainnet PBaaS activation. We will effectively abandon this testnet and leave it running long enough to overlap with the next and final testnet instance before PBaaS release. You should be able to actually send currencies over from the first testnet to the second via Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet, even map some VRSCTEST-CLASSIC or something else through the bridge, but we do not intend to update that daemon again, or continue to run nodes or notaries on the old test network for more than a couple weeks after the new testnet goes live.Thanks for all your help and contributions, both already made and those to come for this historic upcoming release!### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
