    "What does the error message \"Cannot Get a lock on data directory /root/.komodo/VRSC\" indicate about the state of my system?",
    "The error message \"Cannot Get a lock on data directory /root/.komodo/VRSC\" indicates that there is a conflict between multiple instances of Komodo trying to access the same data directory. This typically occurs when Komodo is already running, and you try to start another instance of it.",
    "# ERROR: Cannot Get a lock on data directory /root/.komodo/VRSC.\n\nKomodo is probably already running.\n\n## Procedure:\n\nIt just means you can't start it when it's already running. If it isn't running we can take a look at it.\nCheck to see if it is running by running:\n\n`./verus getinfo`\n\nIf it's running you'll get info back, if it isn't you'll get an error.\nIf that throws an error, it's worth checking using this command:\n\n`ps fax | grep verus`\n\nand seeing if any processes are listed besides the process you're using to search.\nYou would see verusd with a child process of komodo and all its cli arguments.\n\n(submitted by @keda666, solution written by englal.vrsc@)\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-02-26.",
