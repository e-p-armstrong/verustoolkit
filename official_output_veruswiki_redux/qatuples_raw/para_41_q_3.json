    "How can I monitor the progress of a transaction after broadcasting it to the network?",
    "You can monitor the progress of a transaction after broadcasting it to the network by tracking the TXID in your wallet or on a blockchain explorer, such as the Verus Explorer.",
    "3. In the CLI interface adapt and issue this command `sendrawtransaction <\"hex\"-string from step 2>`.\nIn our example that would look like this:\n```bash\nrun sendrawtransaction 0400008085202f8901150f82b53214fe0cb34b3bd57885f6f841384373b173ba6718f31ef6eb6259fa0a000000694c67010101012102c9ca37dac14c819a99ce4a71533ab8d3d5e37643ede9c4da0981081a074f75df40531ea63fb3de6111949652111bbe524506999c97c06302715e85aa5c5813519b3eace4ac15bb3950600f968c0c555a935fd826f1a51e00bd2a7f12d035757fc5feffffff019b011d0d0000000024050403000000cc1b04030001011504575dc6ae7484c83c0dc97a4218f88e2cbe9b659c7552960d006e960d000000000000000000000000\n```\nand your command will show a result similar to this example:\n```json\n4a5202327e6ed2ce20d3b146155ec92e52fae6c4481362faf6f8a072017b41f1\n```\nThe result of this command is the TXID of the coins moving out of your b-address. You can monitor the progress in your wallet or look up the TXID in the [explorer](https://explorer.verus.io).\n\nnote: The above command and its result are examples. ***DO NOT*** use data from it. Use the results from your own wallet!\n\nSome words of advice after succesfully removing funds locked in a b-address:\n* Pay attention to which addresses you send.\n* It may be an idea to import the addresses you use into a fresh wallet, omitting all unused (b-) addresses.\n\nnote: Created 2020-11-11 by Oink.vrsc@",
