    "How do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on Verus?",
    "To sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on Verus, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'`.\n2. Get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency` and use it to get the raw hex transaction data with `verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it with `verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>`.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>`.",
