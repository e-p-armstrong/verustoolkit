    "What is tokenizing ID control in the context of Verus, and how is it achieved?",
    "Tokenizing ID control in Verus is a next-generation NFT (Non-Fungible Token) concept. It is achieved by defining a currency with specific flags, such as OPTION_NFT_TOKEN and OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre-allocated or pre-converted to. This allows for the creation of unique, non-interchangeable tokens that can represent control over an ID.",

If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release.
