    "How can tokens be used in Verus?",
    "Tokens in Verus can be used for various purposes, including payment models, tickets, point systems, etc. They can be controlled by the blockchain or partially controlled by a centralized authority. Tokens can also be used as reserve currencies for other currencies.",
    "**The result will be true if the signature is valid.**\n```\ntrue\n```\nThis release is intended for use in the VRSCTEST only. Mainnet approved testnet release is not yet available# Verus Testnet PBaaS Multi-currency TokensThe testnet supports a completely new capability of token definitions and token launches (Kickstarter/Gofundme style, ICO, ITO, IPO, etc.). These tokens can be sent through the Verus protocol using the new 'sendcurrency' API, which works for all currencies in the Verus network. Tokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies as well. Token launches can accept multiple other coins or tokens for conversion to the new token with payment to the token ID. Each token can have a different conversion price for pre-launch participation as well as minimums and maximums of participation. If minimums are not met by the currency's startblock, all participation will be refunded, less a minimal transfer/network fee, which was already allocated to miners/stakers.Tokens can be controlled by the blockchain and used for many purposes, including payment models, tickets, point systems, etc., or they can be partially blockchain controlled, centralized tokens, with currencies that are mintable at any time by the ID behind them. The controlling ID can also receive receive aggregated outgoing transactions to external systems that both burn coins and pass account data in the process. This will allow applications to control currency supplies on the public network, whether these applications are external, decentralized networks or centralized custodial systems, in many typical use cases of tokens, including club coins, game tokens, token launches, etc., no programming is required.## Defining a CurrencyTo create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can",
