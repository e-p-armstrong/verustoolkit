    "You can define a currency for tokenizing ID control using the command line with the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```\nThis command defines a currency named \"ID\" with the required flags and settings for tokenizing ID control.",
    "NFT mapped tokens will allow you to define an Ethereum NFT as the token that controls revoke and recover for an ID. Similar to how you can define a token for tokenized ID control, an NFT mapped token, when defined, refers by contract and tokenid to a specific NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Once defined as the currency for a specific ID or sub-ID and linked to the Ethereum NFT, that NFT will be able to be sent over from the Ethereum blockchain as a satoshi of that currency, sent to any address or ID on the Verus blockchain, exchanged trustlessly on the Verus on-chain P2P marketplace, and used to revoke and recover the ID which defined the token. Once the contracts are updated, you will be able to mint NFTs on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet, and endow your Ethereum NFTs with all of the power of your specially named VerusID. This new technology allows you to protect your NFTs with VerusID\u2019s revoke and recover technology, bind your NFT to the pseudonymous ID you use to log into applications, use it to extend and publish much more than just the NFT, and generally take your Ethereum NFTs to the next level!The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. Drop by the #pbaas-development channel to help us prepare for mainnet and start building your vision today!### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):\nThe currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```",
