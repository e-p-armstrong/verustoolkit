    "How do I use the `verifyfile` command to verify a Verus download?",
    "To use the `verifyfile` command to verify a Verus download, you need to provide the identity of the signer, the signature, and the path to the downloaded file. The format of the command is:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <path_to_downloaded_file>\n```\nReplace `<signature>` with the actual signature from the txt file, and `<path_to_downloaded_file>` with the actual path to the downloaded file. If the signature is valid, the command will output `true`.",
