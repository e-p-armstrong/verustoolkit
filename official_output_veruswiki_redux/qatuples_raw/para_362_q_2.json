    "What is the significance of upgrading to v1.0.3 of Verus, and what are some of the key changes and improvements in this version?",
    "Upgrading to v1.0.3 of Verus is mandatory for continued mainnet and testnet use. This version fixes some critical issues, including an edge case that could have resulted in unexpected behavior on mainnet, and forgives issues on testnet that were blocking challenge resolution. Additionally, v1.0.3 extends the API fundrawtransaction to allow for easier construction of transactions for DeFi conversions and cross-chain operations.",
