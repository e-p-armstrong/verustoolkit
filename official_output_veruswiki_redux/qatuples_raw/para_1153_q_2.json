    "What is the difference between a time lock and a time delay in Verus?",
    "In Verus, a time lock defines the unlock height of an ID, while a time delay defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. In other words, a time lock specifies when an ID will unlock, while a time delay specifies how long an ID will remain locked after being set to an unlocked state.",
    "k is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n## Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n## Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n  ```\n  Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
