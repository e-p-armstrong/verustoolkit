    "How can I verify the authenticity of a downloaded Verus package using the command line?",
    "To verify the authenticity of a downloaded Verus package, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands to verify the signature. For example:\n\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <file_path>\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <checksum>\n```\n\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.",
