    "How do I define a tokenized ID control (next-generation NFT) using the command line?",
    "To define a tokenized ID control (next-generation NFT), you can use the `definecurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```\n\nThis command defines a currency with the name \"ID\", options set to 2080 (which includes flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN and OPTION_TOKEN), a pre-allocation of 0.00000001 to the address \"ControlTokenRecipient@\", and a maximum pre-conversion of 0.",
    "In addition, we have continued to harden the protocol and fixed issues with cross-chain currency definition import/export and the new ability to burn reserves into a liquidity basket that were reported in the current testnet.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release.

If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent\n`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer.
