    "Why might my antivirus software flag the Verus software as a potential threat?",
    "The Verus software may be flagged by antivirus software such as Avast or Kaspersky as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program) because it is a mining software. This is a false positive warning, indicating that the software could potentially be used by a third party to exploit your PC. However, the software itself is not malicious and is safe to use.",
