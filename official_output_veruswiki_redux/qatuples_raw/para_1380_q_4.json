    "What is the effect of setting \"burn\" to 1 when using the \"sendcurrency\" API on Verus Testnet?",
    "If \"burn\" is set to 1, the currency sent (which must be a token or fractional currency) is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.",
    "While Verus daemon v0.7.1-4 has no improvements for mainnet operation, it offers full support for the new Verus Testnet multi-currency technology preview. On testnet, the new \"sendcurrency\" API, which is already available on Verus mainnet in its simplified form, is enhanced with new multi-currency parameters. The first parameter, \"currency\":\"currencyname\" - where the default on testnet for currency name is \"vrsctest\", specifies the source currency of the send. The next, \"convertto\":\"currencyname\", allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source.# Enhancements to TestNet Protocols for Increased Scale, Currency Burn Functions, and Centralized Fractional Currencies\nVersion v0.7.1-4 is not yet considered hardened for mainnet, but has increased scale over previous versions in addition to the ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency. This allows price neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. This version also enables a new parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API called \"burn\". If \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent, which must be a token or fractional currency is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.",
