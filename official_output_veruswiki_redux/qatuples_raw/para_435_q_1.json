    "What happens if a currency's ID issuance requires permission from the currency's identity?",
    "If a currency's ID issuance requires permission from the currency's identity, then the identity must sign the name commitment and identity registration. This can be done by using the parent identity to fund those transactions, or by receiving a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`.",

(GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.",
