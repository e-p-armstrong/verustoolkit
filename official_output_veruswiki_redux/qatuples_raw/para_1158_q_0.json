    "What is the purpose of the `proofprotocol` option when defining a new currency in Verus?",
    "The `proofprotocol` option determines the protocol used to prove the ownership and validity of transactions on the currency's blockchain. In the example provided, `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which corresponds to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID has the authority to mint new coins.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
