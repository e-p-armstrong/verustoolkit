    "What kind of blockchains can be set up on the Verus network, and how do they interact with each other?",
    "The Verus network supports both public and private, internal blockchains. These private blockchains are easy to set up and can be bridged to public currencies, allowing for seamless transfer of assets between the public chain and the internal network. The Verus network can support an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains, with some overhead for cross-notarization. This enables organizations to have their own private blockchains with all the features and currencies of the public chain, but without the public access.",
    " well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n#### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nWill return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
