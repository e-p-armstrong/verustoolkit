It is considered fully ready for testing on both VRSCTEST testnet and VRSC mainnet. While this release is likely to work fine on mainnet through the coming activation, it is not yet an official release that you should expect to support mainnet activation. If you install this version, please make sure to upgrade to an official release before network activation, which will happen at block 800200, expected to be mined or staked on December 15th.\nThis release enables two technology upgrades, one that would be considered big news to most cryptocurrency projects, an improvement to the FPGA-equalizing hash algorithm, and a revolutionary, new decentralized identity technology, Verus IDs, that will disrupt today\u2019s centralized systems with the most secure, quantum ready, fully decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity system in the world.\n## Verus ID\nVerus ID includes built-in privacy at the core through integration of zk-SNARKs, and provides a revolutionary improvement to blockchain address security, ma",
