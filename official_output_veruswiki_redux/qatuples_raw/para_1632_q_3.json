    "How do I determine the public key of an address where I want to receive coinbases in Verus?",
    "You can determine the public key of an address where you want to receive coinbases in Verus using the `validateaddress` command in either the CLI or GUI.",
    "https://medium.com/veruscoin/veruscoin-0-5-0-official-release-notes-6d371095dc7a\nv0.4.0h fixes address indexes for the insight explorer and some APIs, as well as a rare segfault in network reorg edge cases from the cheatcatcher.\nVersion 0.4.0g includes all improvements in 0.4.0f and an expiry on stake transactions to allow deletion from wallets later\nVersion 0.4.0f includes all improvements in 0.4.0e.\nIn addition, it provides more detail about stake (winner of the contest) and mint (staked reward) transactions in Agama GUI as well as CLI listtransactions. It also introduces safeguards against any possibility of double staking behavior caused by forks and reorgs and the ability to set the maximum number of transparent and private transactions in Agama in settings->App config.\n0.4.0e fixes issues and introduces a much cleaner view of staking transactions and minted coinbases in the Agama GUI. The following community reported issues are resolved:\n1. Coinbase shielding problems to Sapling and sometimes to Sprout private addresses are resolved\n2. Staking will again default to sending the coinbase to the address that staked the reward unless **-pubkey=66charpubkey** is set. The public key of an address where you would like the coinbases to go can be determined using **\"validateaddress\"** either in the CLI or GUI.\n3. Agama GUI no longer shows ins and outs or multiple lines for a staking transaction. Instead, it now displays an easy to understand single line for each \"stake\" transaction and also easily distinguishes between mined and minted coinbases once they are mature.\n## 0.4.0c - released 10/29/2018",
