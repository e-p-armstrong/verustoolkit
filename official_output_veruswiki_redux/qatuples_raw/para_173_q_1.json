    "What is the difference between PROOF_PBAASMMR, PROOF_CHAINID, and PROOF_ETHNOTARIZATION notarization protocols?",
    "PROOF_PBAASMMR (Verus MMR proof) does not require notaries, PROOF_CHAINID requires the chain ID as the sole notary, and PROOF_ETHNOTARIZATION uses Ethereum notarization and PATRICIA TRIE proof. Each protocol has its own security and verification implications, and the choice of protocol depends on the specific use case and requirements.",
