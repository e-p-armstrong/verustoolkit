    "What is the purpose of the Verus Explorer, and how can I use it to determine if a coin is staked or mined?",
    "The Verus Explorer is a tool that allows you to explore the Verus blockchain and get information about transactions and blocks. You can use it to determine if a coin is staked or mined by adding the blockhash of the received award to the end of `https://explorer.verus.io/api/getblock?` and checking the result. If the result shows that the block type is `mined`, then the coin is mined. If it shows that the block type is `minted`, then the coin is staked.",
