    "What is Verus Vault, and how does it protect funds on a VerusID?",
    "Verus Vault is a feature that allows users to protect funds on a VerusID, even in the event of a private key theft. By locking a VerusID with Vault, users cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. While locked, users can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. Additionally, users can still receive funds while their VerusID is locked.",
