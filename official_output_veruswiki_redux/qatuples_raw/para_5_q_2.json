    "How can I import a single WIF for a private address in Verus?",
    "To import a single WIF for a private address in Verus, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings` and select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner.\n2. Enter the following command:\n```\nrun z_importkey \"<wif>\" \"yes\" 1\n```\nReplace `<wif>` with the actual WIF you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier.",
    "## Importing multiple WIFs in one batch for public (transparent) addresses\nTo import your address, go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner and enter the following command for every WIF except for the final one:\n```\nrun importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" false\n```\nImport the final WIF with this command:\n```\nrun importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" true\n```\nThe last command triggers the chain to rescan all addresses in your wallet, including all the addresses you just imported.\nReplace `<wif>` with the actual **wif** (like the one you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier).Note: Don't use the WIF from the example above, but use the one from the CLI-interface in Verus Desktop.The GUI wallet will not show any progress on the import and may give messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting. It will take quite some time for the process to finish in the background, especially if the address has many transaction on it.## Importing a single WIF for a private address\nTo import your address, go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner and enter the following command:\n```\nrun z_importkey \"<wif>\" \"yes\" 1\n```\nReplace `<wif>` with the actual **wif** you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier.Note: Don't use the WIF from the example above, but use the one from the CLI-interface in Verus Desktop.The GUI wallet will not show any progress on the import and may give messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting.
