    "What is the purpose of the `wif` string, and how do I use it?",
    "The `wif` string is a 52-character string that represents the private key of an address in Wallet Import Format (WIF). You need to import this string into your Verus wallet using the `importprivkey` command to gain control over the associated address. To do this, go to `settings` -> `Coin Settings`, select the desired chain, and run the command `run importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" true`, replacing `<wif>` with the actual WIF string you obtained from the `convertpassphrase` command.",
    "You will receive a response __similar__ to this:\n```\n{\n\"walletpassphrase\": \"seedphrase\",\n\"address\": \"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\",\n\"pubkey\": \"02ffc2f4b071afdec631e3fb7d435a0047be14a81ea1a269e4206b0068c0c1fa6f\",\n\"privkey\": \"d899ed88e9ee2e90c2cf51cb47e7b4495ec1e1cb10763bb1c111b0bde48bf86c\",\n\"wif\": \"UwGb5KvGPfMUr1tu74Desjh87ZeJM4wq5goLyThcogeLifc5aJqT\"\n}\n```\nCopy that information and store it somewhere **SAFE**. With this information anyone having access to it will have full control over that address.The 52-character string after **\"wif\":** that is shown, is what you want to import in the next step.## Importing a single WIF for a public (transparent) address\nTo import your address, go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner and enter the following command:\n```\nrun importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" true\n```\nReplace `<wif>` with the actual **wif** you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier.Note: Don't use the WIF from the example above, but use the one from the CLI-interface in Verus Desktop.Note: The GUI wallet will not show any progress on the import and may give messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting. It will take quite some time for the process to finish in the background, especially if the address has many transaction on it.",
