    "How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?",
    "To verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the signature. The `verifyfile` command takes the identity of the signer, the signature, and the file path as arguments, while the `verifyhash` command takes the identity of the signer, the signature, and the hash of the file as arguments.",

This fault while running is only caused by non-typical API, insight explorer, or CLI use, but if it does happen, may result in the need to rescan or resync your wallet. We know of no one on mainnet affected by this issue. We recommend that all users upgrade.",
