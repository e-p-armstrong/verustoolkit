    "How do I use the `verifyfile` command in the Verus CLI to verify a download?",
    "You can use the `verifyfile` command in the Verus CLI to verify a download by providing the identity of the signer, the signature, and the path to the file to be verified. The format of the command is:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"signer_identity\" \"signature\" \"file_path\"\n```\nFor example:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"Ae1xJQABQSCusp3AYTcIlTUklLlDl7goo3n1773y1jIR73JtLLHFgjjwpC/tvuDcJ8hdj/voxmHU2WmTKq7LkVaTAi/EZD1V\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.9-2-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.9-2-x86_64.tar.gz\"\n```",

We need every testnet participant to upgrade to this version as soon as possible to resume notarizations for the ETH bridge and the pbaas chains. Once enough people upgrade, the testnet upgrade can be broadcasted via oracle and we can get closer to getting pbaas on mainnet.### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
