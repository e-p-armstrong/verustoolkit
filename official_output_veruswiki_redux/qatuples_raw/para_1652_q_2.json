    "How can I set my PubKey in Verus CLI to receive mining rewards?",
    "You can set your PubKey in Verus CLI by either adding the `-pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED` option to the end of your daemon startup command, or by editing your `VRSC.conf` file to include the line `pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED`. This will configure Verus to send mining rewards to the associated wallet address.",
    "## In Verus CLI\nStep 1 - First get your wallet address you want to mine to:\nYou can find an address if you already have previous transactions, or you can create a new one. To find an address from a previous transaction, use the command line verus listtransactions and copy the address found after \"address\".\nTo generate a new wallet address, use the command line `verus getnewaddress` and a new address will be created.\n\nStep 2 - Next, using your new address, enter the command with verus-cli `verus validateaddress`. From the output find the long string after \"pubkey\", copy without the quotation marks.\n\nStep 3 - Set your PubKey\n* Option 1: use this pubkey when starting your daemon by adding the following line to the end of your command, just before the \"&\" sign: -pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED\n* Option 2: edit your `VRSC.conf` and add the line `pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED`. Then start your whallet as you are used to.\n\nYour rewards will now be mined to that address. It would be a good idea to keep notes and associate the wallet address with the pubkey...also to double check that you did validate the correct pubkey for the wallet address, making sure you made no errors.\n\n(submitted by @Oliver Westbrook, edited by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nnote: last revision date 2020-02-24.",
