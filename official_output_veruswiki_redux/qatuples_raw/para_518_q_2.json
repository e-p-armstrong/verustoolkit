    "What is the purpose of the v0.9.9-2 update, and what security vulnerabilities does it address?",
    "The v0.9.9-2 update is a critical security update that addresses two important security vulnerabilities. The first is the **Rab13s** vulnerability, which is a zero-day vulnerability that affects over 280 blockchains, including Verus. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to target specific nodes and exhaust their resources. The update mitigates this vulnerability by adapting a fix implemented in Zcash, which also improves privacy while gossiping transactions around the network. The second vulnerability is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the OpenSSL library, which is used by Verus for encrypted node connections. The update includes an important update of the OpenSSL library to address this vulnerability.",

The Verus fix adapts a fix implemented in Zcash that also does a better job of preserving privacy while gossiping transactions around the network by making it harder to track their node of origin via listening nodes.This release also includes an important update of the OpenSSL library, which Verus uses for encrypted node connections and addresses a buffer overflow vulnerability in that library.",
