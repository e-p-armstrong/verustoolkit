    "What are the benefits of using quantum-secure addresses in Verus?",
    "The benefits of using quantum-secure addresses in Verus include retroactive security for all existing transactions sent to your identity, protecting your transactions from potential quantum attacks. This ensures that your transactions remain secure, even if quantum computers become a reality.",
    "ain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well. That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.",
