    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about using the Verus command line. How can I sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency` and `verus z_getoperationstatus`.\n2. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n3. Use `verus signrawtransaction` to sign the raw hex transaction data in each wallet.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.\n\nRemember to follow these steps carefully to ensure your transaction is signed and broadcasted successfully. Do you have any more questions about using the Verus command line?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I've heard about the new Verus testnet. What are the main features of it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that allows users to:\n\n* Create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming.\n* Send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease.\n* Convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.\n\nIt is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets and offers a wide range of possibilities for users. Have you tried the testnet yet?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. What is the main advantage of using Verus compared to other cryptocurrency platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main advantage of using Verus is that it offers a wide range of possibilities and features that are not available on other cryptocurrency platforms. With Verus, users can create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming, and send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease. This makes Verus a more versatile and powerful platform compared to others.",
