    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a question about using VerusIDs. How do I sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID in Verus, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction using the `sendcurrency` command, specifying the multi-signature ID and the destination address and amount.\n2. Get the raw transaction data using the `z_getoperationstatus` command.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n4. Sign the raw transaction data using the `signrawtransaction` command.\n5. After all necessary signatures are applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about these steps or if you'd like more information on using multi-signature IDs in Verus.\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about the new Verus testnet. What features does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers a lot of exciting features. Some of the key features include:\n\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Ability to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange\n* Accessible from Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets\n\nThese features make the Verus testnet a powerful platform for building decentralized applications and ecosystems. Would you like to know more about how to get started with the testnet?\n\n**User:**\nWhat makes Verus unique compared to other cryptocurrency platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers many features that are not available on other cryptocurrency platforms. Some of the key things that set Verus apart include:\n\n* Ability to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform\n\nThese features make Verus a powerful and flexible platform for building decentralized applications and ecosystems. Verus is really pushing the boundaries of what's possible with blockchain technology. Do you have any other questions about Verus or how it compares to other platforms?",
