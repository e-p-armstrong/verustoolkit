    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard some concerns about miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running in DeFi protocols. How does the Verus DeFi protocol address these problems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol has a solution for these issues. It ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities. By doing so, Verus prevents MEV and front-running, creating a more fair and secure environment for its users.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I've also been wondering about the significance of simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches in Verus. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches allow for the creation of a new blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This enables seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and other blockchains, with all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool being earned on the new blockchain, without any rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This is a unique feature of Verus, allowing for a more decentralized and community-driven approach to blockchain development.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also interested in the blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches in Verus. How do they work, and what happens if the minimum participation levels are not met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches allow users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimum levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. This ensures that users are protected in case the minimum participation levels are not reached. It's a secure and transparent way to launch new currencies, giving users more control and confidence in the process.",
