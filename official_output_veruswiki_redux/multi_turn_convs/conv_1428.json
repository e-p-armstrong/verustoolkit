    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got some questions about VerusIDs and security. How does a locked VerusID protect against unauthorized access to funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA locked VerusID provides an additional layer of security against unauthorized access to funds. Even if someone has the primary keys, they must first unlock the ID and then wait for a predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access the funds. This delay allows the revocation and recovery authority identities to detect and respond to any unauthorized unlock attempts, effectively preventing the unauthorized access to funds. Do you have any further questions about locked VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, I do. What is the purpose of setting an unlock delay on a locked VerusID, and how does it relate to the 5-dollar wrench attack?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSetting an unlock delay on a locked VerusID provides a decentralized solution to the 5-dollar wrench attack, where an attacker tries to force the owner to reveal their private keys. The unlock delay gives the revocation and recovery authority identities time to detect and respond to any unauthorized unlock attempts, effectively preventing the attacker from accessing the funds. This adds an extra layer of protection against coercion or physical threats. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI think so! What about Verus Vault? What additional features does it provide beyond protecting and recovering funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault provides security and recovery features not only for funds but also for IDs and NFTs. It also allows for time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This provides a comprehensive solution for protecting and preserving blockchain assets and wealth. Verus Vault is a powerful tool for securing your digital assets.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I've got a handle on that. How can I export an ID to a PBaaS chain using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\n\nThis command exports the ID \"IDNAME@\" to the PBaaS chain \"PBaaSChainName\" with an amount of 100 VRSCTEST. Just replace the placeholders with your actual values and you're good to go!",
