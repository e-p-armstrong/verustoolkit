    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard of Verus Vault, but I'm not entirely sure what it is or how it works. Can you explain what Verus Vault is and how it protects my funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a security feature that allows you to lock your VerusID, preventing any spending of funds from that identity until it is unlocked. While locked, you can still stake your funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. You can also still receive funds, but you cannot spend them. This provides an extra layer of protection for your funds, giving you more control over when and how they can be accessed.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What are the requirements for using Verus Vault, and how does it work with revocation and recovery authorities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo use Verus Vault, you need to have at least one primary identity and one revocation/recovery ID configured. A locked VerusID can be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which can circumvent the lock. However, anyone with only the primary keys (even a multisig of primary keys) must first unlock and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" before. How does Verus Vault provide protection against that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault provides protection against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" by allowing you to set a delay (e.g. 24 hours) before you can spend or access funds after unlocking your VerusID. This means that even if someone gains access to your private keys, they will not be able to immediately spend or access your funds. This delay provides time for the revocation and recovery authorities to detect and respond to any unauthorized unlock attempts.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Are there any other uses for Verus Vault beyond protecting funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault can also be used to protect and recover IDs and NFTs, as well as for time locks for other purposes such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. It's a versatile feature that can be used in a variety of ways to add an extra layer of security and control to your VerusID and assets.",

            "#### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",
