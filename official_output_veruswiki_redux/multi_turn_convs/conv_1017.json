    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about Linux security. How can I disable login with the Root User in a Linux system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDisabling Root User login is a great security measure. To do so, you can follow these steps:\n\nFirst, open the SSH configuration file using the command `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`. \n\nNext, find the line `PermitRootLogin yes` and change it to `PermitRootLogin no`. \n\nThen, save the changes and exit the editor. \n\nFinally, apply the new settings by restarting the SSH service using the command `sudo systemctl restart sshd`. \n\nBy doing this, you'll prevent anyone from logging in directly as the Root User, which can help prevent unauthorized access to your system. Do you have any other Linux security questions?",
