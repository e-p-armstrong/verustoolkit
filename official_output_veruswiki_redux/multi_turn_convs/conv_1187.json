    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the Verus API, and I'm not entirely sure what the `sendcurrency` API does. Can you explain its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is used to send and convert funds between different currencies and addresses. It's a powerful tool that allows you to manage your funds across various currencies and addresses.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds useful. How can I send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient by running the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to the address \"alice@\".\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the difference between sending VRSCTEST from a single address and sending from all private wallet funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen sending from a single address, you specify the exact address that the funds will be sent from. When sending from all private wallet funds, you use the \"*\" or \"*Z\" wildcard to send from all available funds in the wallet. This allows you to send funds to multiple recipients from multiple addresses in a single transaction.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I convert VRSCTEST to a different currency, such as a fractional basket currency, using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to a different currency by specifying the `convertto` parameter in the `sendcurrency` API. For example, to convert VRSCTEST to VRSC-BTC, you would run the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to VRSC-BTC.",
