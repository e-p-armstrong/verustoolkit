    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I think I may have made a mistake. I launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the latest release. What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo worries! If you have launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the latest release, you should delete the following directories before running the new update. The directories you need to delete are:\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nThis will ensure a clean update. Did you have any other questions about updating VRSCTEST or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I have another question, what kind of warranty or liability is provided with the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, and NONINFRINGEMENT. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\nIn other words, the software is provided \"as is\" and there is no warranty or liability. Does that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nGot it. One more question, what permissions are granted to users of the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsers of the Verus software are granted permission to deal in the software without restriction, including the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so, subject to the conditions that the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\nSo, users have a lot of flexibility with the software, as long as they follow the conditions mentioned. Do you have any more questions about Verus or VRSCTEST?",
