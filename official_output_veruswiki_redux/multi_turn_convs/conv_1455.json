    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `setidentitytimelock` command, but I'm not sure what arguments I need to specify. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using the `setidentitytimelock` command, you need to specify either \"unlockatblock\" or \"setunlockdelay\", but not both. These two arguments are mutually exclusive.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. What does the \"unlockatblock\" argument do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"unlockatblock\" argument specifies an absolute block height at which the identity timelock should be unlocked. The countdown to unlock starts when the transaction is mined into a block.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And what about the \"setunlockdelay\" argument? What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"setunlockdelay\" argument specifies a delay in blocks after the unlock request is made before the identity timelock is actually unlocked. This delay can only be circumvented by revoking and recovering the identity.\n\n**User:**\nI see. One more question. What's the purpose of the \"returntx\" argument when used with the `setidentitytimelock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"returntx\" argument is a boolean option that defaults to false. If set to true, the transaction is signed by the wallet and returned as a hex serialized transaction, rather than being sent. In this case, the transaction must be sent manually using the \"sendrawtransaction\" command after any necessary signatures are applied.",
