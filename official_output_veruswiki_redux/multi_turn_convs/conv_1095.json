    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nYou mentioned that VerusIDs are more than just an ID system. What makes them more than that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. This means that they provide a range of features and capabilities beyond a traditional ID system. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What benefits do VerusIDs offer in terms of security and quantum resistance?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are quantum ready and friendly, meaning they are resistant to quantum attacks using known algorithms. Additionally, Verus is integrating a quantum secure signature scheme, which will allow IDs to be changed and have all funds sent to them made retroactively quantum resistant. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really reassuring. How do VerusIDs allow for control over funds and UTXOs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs allow the controller of the identity to control funds and UTXOs by specifying single or multi-sig addresses. If these controlling addresses or properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What advantages do VerusIDs offer in terms of decentralization and control?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are fully decentralized, meaning anyone can create one and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers, rather than a central authority. This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really empowering. How do VerusIDs interact with other blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs can be used to publish ID -> destination address mappings on other blockchains. However, only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.",

            "VerusIDs are true self-sovereign identities and aren't simply an ID system as much as a fully functional blockchain protocol. There is no business in the protocol, but plenty of opportunity for those who use what it can do for identity applications. Verus ID provides:**Quantum ready** friendly crypto addresses on the worldwide Verus network -- VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.
