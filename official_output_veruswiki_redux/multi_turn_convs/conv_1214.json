    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to run `./verusd` on my Linux distro, but I'm running into some errors. What might cause errors when running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution like Debian or Devuan?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot all dependencies required by `./verusd` may be installed by default on a Linux distribution like Debian or Devuan, which can cause errors. This is a common issue, and it's usually easy to resolve.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Speaking of errors, I'm getting these two: \"error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory\" and \"error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory\" when running `./verusd`. How do I resolve these errors?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo resolve these errors, you need to install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries. You can do this by running the command `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`. This should fix the issue and allow you to run `./verusd` without any problems. Give it a try and let me know if you have any further issues!",
