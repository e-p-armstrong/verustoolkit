    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to download Verus software, but my antivirus software keeps flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! Verus software may be flagged as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) by some antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky because it includes mining software, which could potentially be used by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review the provided resources to learn more about it. Don't worry, Verus software is safe to use!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! But how can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download to make sure it's safe?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to your desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the CLI to verify the signature. The signature is signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". This ensures that the download is genuine and hasn't been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the text file included with each Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe text file included with each Verus download contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. This information is used to verify the authenticity of the download. It's an extra layer of security to ensure that you're getting the real deal!\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that I need to upgrade my full nodes to v0.9.0 or later by a certain block number. What happens if I don't?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't upgrade your full nodes to v0.9.0 or later by a certain block number, you will no longer be connected to the mainnet Verus blockchain. It is mandatory to upgrade to v0.9.0 or later to remain connected to the mainnet. So, make sure to upgrade in time to avoid any issues!",
