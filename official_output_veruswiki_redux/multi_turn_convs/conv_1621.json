    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about using Verus commands. What does the `refundfailedlaunch` command do in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `refundfailedlaunch` command refunds any funds sent to a chain if they are eligible for refund. It attempts to refund all transactions for all contributors. Do you have any further questions about this command or its usage?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. How do I use the `refundfailedlaunch` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `refundfailedlaunch` command by running `verus refundfailedlaunch \"currencyid\"` in the command line, replacing \"currencyid\" with the hex or chain name of the chain you want to refund contributions to. You can also use the Verus RPC API by sending a JSON-RPC request with the method \"refundfailedlaunch\" and \"currencyid\" as a parameter. Have you tried using this command before, or do you have any questions about its usage?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I haven't tried using it yet. But I do have another question. What is the purpose of the `sendcurrency` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` command is used to send one or many Verus outputs to one or many addresses on the same or another chain. It sources funds automatically from the current wallet. Do you have any questions about how to use this command, or about specifying the source of funds?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes! How do I specify the source of funds when using the `sendcurrency` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can specify the source of funds by providing a \"fromaddress\" argument, which can be a VerusID or address. If you don't specify a \"fromaddress\", funds may come from any source set of UTXOs controlled by the wallet. You can also use wildcards such as \"*\", \"R*\", and \"i*\" to specify the source of funds. Additionally, you can use `\"idname@:private\"` to source funds from a balance of a private address attached to the wallet. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about using `sendcurrency` or any other Verus commands?",
