    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been using VRSCTEST for a while, but I just updated to the latest release. Is there anything I need to do before running the new update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the latest release, you should delete the following directories before running the new update: `~/.komodo/vrsctest` on Linux, `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest` on MacOS, and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` on Windows.\n\n**User:**\nI've noticed a disclaimer when I installed the Verus software. What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer is a warning that the software is experimental and unfinished, and that users should use it at their own risk. It also includes a statement that the software is provided \"as is\" without warranty, and that the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any damages or other liability arising from the use of the software.\n\n**User:**\nI want to make sure I understand the terms of using the Verus software. Can you summarize them for me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe terms and conditions of using the Verus software are that the enclosed copyright notice and permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. Additionally, the software is provided \"as is\" without warranty, and the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any damages or other liability arising from the use of the software.",
