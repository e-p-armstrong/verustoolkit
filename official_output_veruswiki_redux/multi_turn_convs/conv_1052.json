    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to download the Verus software, but my antivirus software keeps flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these warnings. Don't worry, Verus is a legitimate and safe software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But how can I verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify a Verus download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the file directly or using a checksum, respectively. The packages are signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\".\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thank you! What's the purpose of the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download. `verifyfile` verifies the file directly, while `verifyhash` verifies using a checksum. This ensures that the downloaded file has not been tampered with and is authentic. It's an extra layer of security to give you peace of mind when downloading and installing Verus.",
