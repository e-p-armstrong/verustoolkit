    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to figure out how to use the Verus CLI interface. Can you help me understand the purpose of the `sendrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendrawtransaction` command is used to broadcast a raw transaction to the Verus network. It takes a hex-string as an argument, which is the raw transaction data. This command is used to send a transaction that has been created and signed offline. Do you have any other questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for explaining that. What happens when I successfully execute the `sendrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of successfully executing the `sendrawtransaction` command is the TXID (Transaction ID) of the transaction that was just broadcast to the network. This TXID can be used to track the progress of the transaction in your wallet or on a blockchain explorer. Would you like to know more about tracking transactions?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I had a different question. What should I do after successfully removing funds locked in a b-address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter successfully removing funds locked in a b-address, it is recommended to pay attention to which addresses you send funds to and consider importing the used addresses into a fresh wallet, omitting all unused (b-) addresses. This is a best practice to maintain wallet organization and security. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks. One more question: how can I monitor the progress of a transaction after broadcasting it to the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can monitor the progress of a transaction after broadcasting it to the network by tracking the TXID in your wallet or on a blockchain explorer, such as the Verus Explorer. This will allow you to see the status of your transaction and when it's confirmed on the blockchain.",
