    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there! I'm trying to run Verus on my Linux machine, but I'm not sure about the dependencies required. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo run Verus on Linux, you need to install some dependencies. On Ubuntu 16.04/Xenial, you'll need to install the `libcurl4-openssl-dev` package, and on Ubuntu 18.04/Bionic+, you'll need to install the `libcurl4` package. You can install these packages using the following commands:\n```\nsudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev  # for Ubuntu 16.04/Xenial\nsudo apt install libcurl4  # for Ubuntu 18.04/Bionic+\n```\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nThanks for that! I was also wondering about the warranty and liability disclaimer for using Verus software. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. Just wanted to make sure you're aware of that!\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks! One more question: where can I find the VirusTotal detection results for Verus software on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find the VirusTotal detection results for Verus software on different operating systems at the following links:\n* MacOS: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/d873c1b7ccb6dc1a7df28d301c28cb810bc9df6c328f90b3165933b9985a0307/detection\n* Linux: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/e5074eda5ad79e17ae766d67896d3d0e218aef6db4054b5f442be6a679f49209/detection\n* Windows: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/ebf07aacc896b4acb3aa39655f4ad370af1ccb3220199db9f01f5251d6867949/detection\n\nJust click on the links to see the results!",
