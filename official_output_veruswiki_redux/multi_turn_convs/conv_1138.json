    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm about to start using Verus, but I want to make sure I understand the terms of use. What kind of warranty or liability does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that the authors and copyright holders are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. It's essential to understand this before using the software.\n\n**User:**\nI noticed that my antivirus software flagged the Verus software as a potential threat. Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC. However, this is a false positive, and the software is safe to use. Don't worry, it's not a real threat!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Where can I find more information about these false positive warnings from antivirus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about the false positive warnings from antivirus software by reviewing the resources provided, such as the Malwarebytes blog post on PUP.Optional.BitcoinMiner and the Kaspersky blog post on \"not-a-virus\" warnings. These resources should give you a better understanding of what's going on and why it's a false positive.",
