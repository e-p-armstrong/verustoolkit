    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm thinking of using the Verus software, but I have some concerns about the warranty and liability. What kind of warranty or guarantee does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty or guarantee, either express or implied. This means that the authors and copyright holders do not provide any guarantees about the software's performance, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property rights.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What if I encounter issues with the Verus software? Who is liable for any damages or losses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the disclaimer, the authors and copyright holders of the Verus software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from or in connection with the software or its use. So, it's essential to understand that you're using the software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nI'm concerned about the security of the Verus software. Are there any virus scans or security checks that have been done on the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the Verus software has been scanned for viruses and malware on various platforms, including MacOS, Linux-AMD64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows. You can check the VirusTotal website for the scan results, which provide information on the detection of any potential threats.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I did notice that some antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis is because the Verus software includes mining functionality, which may be misidentified as potentially unwanted or malicious by some antivirus software. This is a false positive, and you can find more information about these types of warnings on the Malwarebytes and Kaspersky websites.",
