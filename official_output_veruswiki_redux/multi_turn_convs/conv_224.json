    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about signing transactions from multi-signature IDs in Verus. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID in Verus, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction using the `sendcurrency` command and get the raw transaction data.\n2. Get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency` and use it to get the raw hex transaction data with `z_getoperationstatus`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using `signrawtransaction`.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `sendrawtransaction`.\n\nDid that help? Do you have any further questions about signing transactions from multi-signature IDs?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I was also curious about the Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet. What are the main features of it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers:\n\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Ability to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange\n* Accessible from Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets\n\nThese features make the Verus testnet a powerful platform for creating and managing multiple cryptocurrencies, identities, and liquidity pools. Do you have any more questions about the Verus testnet?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. What makes the Verus testnet unique compared to other cryptocurrency platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus testnet offers features and capabilities that are not available on other cryptocurrency platforms, such as:\n\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Ability to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange\n\nThese features make Verus a more versatile and powerful platform compared to other cryptocurrency platforms. The ability to create new identities, currencies, and blockchains without programming, and the ease of sending and converting currencies, set Verus apart from other platforms. Do you have any more questions about Verus or its testnet?",
