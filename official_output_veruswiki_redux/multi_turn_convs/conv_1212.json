    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm new to Verus and I'm trying to set up my wallet. Can you walk me through the essential steps?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe essential steps to set up your Verus wallet include installing or updating the latest version of the wallet, making a backup of your wallet, and installing the bootstrap. These steps will get you started with your Verus wallet. Do you have any questions about any of these steps?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm a bit of a visual learner. Is there a visual guide available to help me with the setup process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is a video available that provides an explanation of how to accomplish the setup steps. You can watch the video titled \"Bootstrapping your wallet manually\" to get a better understanding of the process. It should help clarify any questions you may have.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds helpful. One more question: do I need to keep the bootstrap archive after setting up my wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need to keep the bootstrap archive after setting up your wallet. You can remove it to free up space on your hard drive if desired. The bootstrap is only necessary for the initial setup, so you can safely delete it once you've completed the process.",
