    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have a few questions about the Verus software. What kind of warranty or guarantee does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty or guarantee of any kind, express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Do you have any other questions about the software?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What kind of liability do the authors or copyright holders of the Verus software have in case of any issues or damages?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders of the Verus software are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. They're trying to make it clear that they're not responsible for any issues that might arise from using the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've noticed that some antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAvast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review additional resources to learn more about these false positives. It's not actually a virus or malware, but rather a misunderstanding by the antivirus software.\n\n**User:**\nWhere can I find more information about these false positive warnings from antivirus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about the false positive warnings from antivirus software by reviewing the resources provided, such as the Malwarebytes blog post on PUP.Optional.BitcoinMiner and the Kaspersky blog post on \"Not-a-virus\". These resources should give you a better understanding of what's going on and why the antivirus software is flagging the Verus software.",
