    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to learn more about the PBaaS protocol, specifically the new capabilities introduced in version 1.0.1. Can you tell me what those are?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new capabilities introduced in version 1.0.1 of the PBaaS protocol extend the idea of a centralized currency. Some of the new features include:\n\n1. Minting of currency on demand by the identity of the currency as part of the `sendcurrency` command.\n2. Burning a liquidity basket currency to affect the reserve ratio weights of the currency.\n3. Registering identities on a currency, with fees sent directly to the identity of the currency.\n4. Converting a centralized currency to a decentralized currency by setting the endblock, losing special control over it.\n5. Allowing decentralized non-liquidity tokens to register identities.\n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions about these features!\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thank you! I'm particularly interested in burning a liquidity basket currency. What happens when that's done?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a liquidity basket currency is burned in version 1.0.1 of the PBaaS protocol, it affects the reserve ratio weights of the currency, rather than the supply/reserve ratio as normal burns do. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that does. Another question I had was about registering identities on a currency. How do fees work in that case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen registering identities on a currency in version 1.0.1 of the PBaaS protocol, the fee for the registration is sent directly to the identity of the currency, rather than being burned into the currency. So the fees go to the currency's identity, not to the currency itself.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And what about setting the endblock on a centralized currency? What happens then?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the endblock is set on a centralized currency in version 1.0.1 of the PBaaS protocol, all centralized capabilities of the same ID end, and the currency is converted to a decentralized currency with no special control over it after that point by any identity on the network. In other words, the currency becomes decentralized and no single identity has control over it.",

            "### What\u2019s New\nIn addition to the full PBaaS protocol and all capabilities previously described, version 1.0.1 will also include some new capabilities that were previously not in the PBaaS protocol. The capabilities basically extend the idea of a centralized currency to include the ability to launch temporarily centralized currencies, including those that can issue identities. This is achieved by setting the \u201cendblock\u201d on a centralized currency launch of either a token or liquidity basket, enabling:\n 1) Minting of currency on demand by the identity of the currency as part of the `sendcurrency`command.\n 2) Burning a liquidity basket currency, but instead of affecting the supply/reserve ratio as normal burns do, the identity of a centralized currency can also burn currency to affect the reserve ratio weights of the currency.\n 3) Registering identities on a currency. When an identity is registered on a centralized currency, the fee for the registration is not burned into the currency, but sent directly to the identity of the currency. This is true for token or liquidity basket currencies. For decentralized currencies, fees are burned, which on a liquidity basket, puts them into the liquidity pool for all LPs to share in earnings, and for a standard token, reduces the supply and available future registrations on that currency.\n 4) In v1.0.1, setting the endblock of a centralized currency causes all centralized capabilities of the same ID to end, converting it in whatever state it currently is in a decentralized currency with no special control over it after that occurs by any identity on the network.\n 5) v1.0.0 did not allow a decentralized non-liquidity token to register identities. v1.0.1 does.",
