    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus retrieves a list of all currencies that meet certain criteria. Specifically, it returns currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, a VRSC reserve ratio greater than 10%, and have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. But what if I want to find currencies with specific markets, like BTC and ETH? How can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies with specific markets by specifying the market currencies as arguments. For example, to find currencies with BTC and ETH markets, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return a list of currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
