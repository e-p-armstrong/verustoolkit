    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit worried about my pending transactions on the bridge. I haven't upgraded to the latest version of Verus yet. What happens to them if I don't upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have pending transactions on the bridge and haven't upgraded to the latest version of Verus, some requested conversions may come back as refunded, and you should receive all amounts expected, less fees. However, if you continue running the old version, you may need to resync to testnet from scratch to continue. It's always a good idea to stay up-to-date with the latest version of Verus to avoid any potential issues.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What improvements can I expect from upgrading to the latest version of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUpgrading to the latest version of Verus (v0.8.0-4 or later) should bring improvements without disruption. Specifically, this release resolves several testnet issues, including: support for larger proofs, enabling more types of cross-chain proving in the future; fixing failed refunds of conversion transactions attempted after a fractional currency launches but before its preconversion phase is complete; ensuring currencies are marked as \"launch complete\" immediately after all preconversions have been processed, enabling normal conversions in all directions; fixing an issue that left some import notarizations incomplete, causing cross-chain transfers to wait longer than expected; and improving and validating hardening.\n\n**User:**\nI think I might have sent some transactions during the time when fractional currency launches were not fully supported. What happens to those transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you sent transactions during the time when fractional currency launches were not fully supported, you may have stuck refunds that should flow after upgrading to the latest version of Verus. Upgrading should help resolve this issue and get your refunds processed.\n\n**User:**\nHow does the latest version of Verus improve the processing of preconversions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe latest version of Verus ensures that currencies are marked as \"launch complete\" immediately after all preconversions have been processed, enabling normal conversions in all directions from that point forward. This should help streamline the process and reduce any potential delays or issues.",

I hope we can keep that level of participation or more up, as it has been extremely helpful. Because of all that\u2019s happened on this testnet to date, we were able to make a lot of progress in finding and resolving the following testnet issues in this release:1. Enable support for much larger proofs than was previously possible from systems that either have large proofs required or significantly variable length proofs. Having this capability in the daemon will pave the way for more types of cross-chain proving in the future as well.\n2. Fix failed refunds of conversion transactions attempted after a fractional currency launches, but before it\u2019s preconversion phase is complete.
