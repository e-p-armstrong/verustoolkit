    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been hearing some buzz about a bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge. Can you tell me what that is, and what's the current status?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge is a feature that allows for the transfer of assets between the Verus network and the Ethereum network. It's been testing on private networks and is expected to be launched on the mainnet soon, after being vetted by community test volunteers on the release testing network. This is a really exciting development, as it will open up new possibilities for interoperability between the two networks.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds cool. I've also seen something about a `getvdxfid` RPC call. What's that, and what's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getvdxfid` RPC call is a new feature in Verus that allows users to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys along with their ID and published names. These keys can be used to create self-sovereign, decentralized, and rent-free social media profiles, as demonstrated by community members. It's a powerful tool for building decentralized applications and experiences.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What is VDXF, and how does it relate to Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVDXF stands for Verus Data eXchange Format. It is a format used to exchange data on the Verus network, particularly for self-sovereign user experiences, applications, and businesses. Verus is a platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications and experiences, and VDXF is a key technology that facilitates this. It's a fundamental part of the Verus ecosystem, and it has a lot of potential for enabling innovative uses cases.",

            "1. Testnet reset with fixes for all reported PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID user issues. If you had reported issues, please verify that the issues you reported are addressed in this release.\n2. Support for the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge, which has been testing on private networks and which we hope to launch within a day or two after first vetting it on the release testing network with community test volunteers.\n3. Support for the new `getvdxfid` RPC call, used along with your ID and published names to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys, which community members used to create the world\u2019s first self-sovereign, completely decentralized, rent-free, non-cancelable social media profiles as can be seen here: https://luckpool.net/profile/identity/mike.vrsc . Work is underway to document the VDXF keys defined and used for profiles as well as the process of setting up your own. While the capability is already extremely powerful, we should remind everyone that Verus is a platform, not a social network. The core technology is exciting, but what will be even more exciting is when businesses and entrepreneurs leverage it to enable new, self-sovereign user experiences, applications, and accompanying businesses to enable the future, truly decentralized web.\n4. Fix for the Electron certificate issue in the GUI wallet, which has been affecting prices and preventing BTC fee calculation.\n5. Support for some additional, popular ERC20 currencies, in anticipation of more usage after release of the ETH bridge.\n6. Fix in GUI for calculated balances of specific addresses sometimes showing lower than actual, even though wallet balance displayed correctly.\n7. Additional hardening, fixes and improvement focused on mainnet and the Ethereum bridge.",
