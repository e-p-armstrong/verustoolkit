    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with my wallet. I got an error message saying \"Your wallet.dat is not matching the blockchain. Please restart the wallet with -reindex param\". What's going on and how can I fix it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat error message usually occurs when you try to move coinbase coins without following Verus blockchain rules. Don't worry, it's an easy fix! To resolve this, you need to shield your coinbase coins by moving them through a private address (zaddress) first. Here's what you need to do:\n\n1. Create a private address (starting with `zs`) in the \"Receive\" screen.\n2. Copy the new private address to your clipboard.\n3. Go to the \"Mining\" screen, select Verus, and select \"Shield Rewards\".\n4. Leave \"All unshielded funds\" as the source and paste the new zaddress into the destination.\n5. Click on \"Continue\".\n6. Wait until you have a private balance showing on the Wallet screen.\n7. Send again, this time from your private address to any normal transparent receive address that you have.\n\nHave you tried shielding your coinbase coins before?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I haven't. Why do I need to shield my coinbase coins before moving them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nShielding your coinbase coins is a requirement of the Verus blockchain rules. This is because coinbase coins need to be moved through a private address (zaddress) before they can be sent to a normal transparent receive address. It's a security feature to ensure the privacy and integrity of the Verus network.\n\nBy the way, do you know how to create a private address (zaddress)?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I'm not sure. How do I create a private address (zaddress)?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEasy one! A private address (zaddress) is a special type of address that starts with `zs`. You can create one in the \"Receive\" screen of your Verus wallet. Just go to the \"Receive\" screen and follow the prompts to create a new address. You'll know it's a private address because it will start with `zs`.",
