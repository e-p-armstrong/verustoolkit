    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about DeFi protocols, and I was wondering how the Verus DeFi protocol addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been thinking about the launch process for blockchains and liquidity pools in Verus. What's the significance of launching a blockchain and a liquidity pool simultaneously?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, launching a blockchain and a liquidity pool simultaneously allows for a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool to be part of defining a new blockchain. This means that the bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but are bound to the launch of the new blockchain and run on the new blockchain. All fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been interested in blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches. How does Verus ensure that these launches are successful, with minimum participation or automatic refunds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus allows users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on-chain. If, by the start time of the blockchain, the minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees.! The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, and similarly price-neutral carve-outs. This ensures that launches are successful and participants are protected.",
