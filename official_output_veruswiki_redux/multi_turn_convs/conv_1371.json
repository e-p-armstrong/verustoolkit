    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about the GOLD token launch. What happens after the GOLD token launches, if I had parked a conversion of VRSCTEST to GOLD?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter the GOLD token launches, if you had parked a conversion of VRSCTEST to GOLD, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned. So, you don't have to worry about losing your tokens during the conversion process. You'll either get the converted GOLD tokens or your original VRSCTEST tokens back. Do you have any other questions about the GOLD token launch or the conversion process?",
