    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get started with mining on Verus CLI, but I'm not sure where to start. How do I find a wallet address to mine to in Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo find a wallet address to mine to in Verus CLI, you have a couple of options. You can either list previous transactions using `verus listtransactions` and copy the address found after \"address\", or you can generate a new wallet address using `verus getnewaddress`. This will give you a valid wallet address where you can receive mining rewards. Have you tried either of these methods?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps! Now, I have another question. How can I set my PubKey in Verus CLI to receive mining rewards?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo set your PubKey in Verus CLI, you can either add the `-pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED` option to the end of your daemon startup command, or you can edit your `VRSC.conf` file to include the line `pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED`. This will configure Verus to send mining rewards to the associated wallet address. Make sure to replace `THELONGSTRINGCOPIED` with your actual PubKey. Have you tried setting up your PubKey before?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I haven't, but I think I understand now. Thanks for the help!",
