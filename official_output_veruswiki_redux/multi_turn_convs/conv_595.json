    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit concerned about the warranty and liability of the Verus software. What kind of warranty or liability does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. Does that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I did encounter an issue with my antivirus software when installing Verus. Why do some antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAvast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program) because it includes mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a warning, not a detection of a virus or malware. The software itself is not malicious, but the warning is there to alert you to the potential risks.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that helps clarify things. What should I do if my antivirus software flags the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf your antivirus software flags the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", you can review the resources provided to understand more about the false positives. The software is not malicious, but rather a warning about the potential risks of mining software. You can choose to allow the software to install and use it at your own risk. It's always a good idea to educate yourself on the software and its components before making a decision.",
