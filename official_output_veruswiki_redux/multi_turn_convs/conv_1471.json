    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few questions about Verus software. Why might antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAntivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky might flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because Verus includes mining software, which could be exploited by a third party to use your computer's resources without your consent. But don't worry, Verus is a legitimate software and this flagging is just a precautionary measure.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can use the provided `.txt` file containing the signer, standard SHA256 file checksum, and signature. The packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". You can extract the downloaded archive, verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds a bit complicated. Is there a simpler way to verify a Verus file using the command line interface (CLI)?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify a Verus file directly using the CLI by running a command like:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signer_identity> <file_path>\n```\nThis will verify the signature of the file and return `true` if the signature is valid.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about verifying a Verus file using a checksum using the CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify a Verus file using a checksum using the CLI by running a command like:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signer_identity> <checksum>\n```\nThis will verify the checksum of the file and return `true` if the checksum is valid.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about a GUI upgrade v0.7.3-5. What's the purpose of that, and what issues does it resolve?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe GUI upgrade v0.7.3-5 is a non-mandatory upgrade that resolves an ID wallet sync issue for the mainnet, which could occur when recovering a revoked ID, causing the wallet to double count some amounts. This issue did not result in a loss of funds or a security issue. The upgrade also resolves all known testnet issues on the current testnet and does not require a testnet reset.",
