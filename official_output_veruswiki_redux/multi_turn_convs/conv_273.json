    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to set up my Mac for pool-mining and I heard that I need to deprioritize the mining process. What's the importance of doing that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Deprioritizing the mining process allows your miner to throttle down whenever your PC needs processing power, preventing the miner from interfering with other processes running on your PC, such as CPU-heavy applications like games. This way, you can ensure a smooth experience while mining.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for clarifying that. I was also wondering, I've been using the Verus wallet for solo-mining, but I've heard that's not recommended. Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus wallet (GUI and CLI) does more than just mining, so it's not recommended for solo-mining setups. Instead, you should use pool-mining software specifically designed for mining. The wallet has additional features that can interfere with the mining process, so it's better to use a dedicated mining software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I've been using NHEQMINER for pool-mining, and I want to adjust the batchfile to run on low priority. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo adjust the batchfile to run on low priority when using NHEQMINER, you need to add `nice -n 19 ` in front of the command you normally use. For example:\n```\nnice -n 19./nheqminer -v -l pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -p x -t 6\n```\nMake sure to replace the pool and address with your preferred pool and mining address.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question about NHEQMINER. What's the purpose of the identifier in the command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe identifier in the NHEQMINER command is used to easily identify the miner. You can change it to a name that identifies the miner to you. It's a way to label your miner so you can keep track of it.",
