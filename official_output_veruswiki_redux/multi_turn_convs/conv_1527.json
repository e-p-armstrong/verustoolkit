    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having trouble understanding some of the commands in Verus. Can you help me with the `getnetworkhashps` command? What is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getnetworkhashps` command is used to estimate the network solutions per second based on the last n blocks. However, it's deprecated and has been replaced by `getnetworksolps` for backwards-compatibility. You should use `getnetworksolps` instead.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the tip. How can I use the `getnetworksolps` command to estimate the network speed at a certain block height?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getnetworksolps` command to estimate the network speed at a certain block height by passing the block height as an argument. For example: `verus getnetworksolps <height>`.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the optional arguments for the `getnetworksolps` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getnetworksolps` command has two optional arguments:\n\n1. `blocks`: The number of blocks to consider, or -1 for blocks over the difficulty averaging window. The default value is 120.\n2. `height`: The block height at which to estimate the network speed. The default value is -1.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the `getnetworksolps` command?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that helps a lot. I also wanted to ask about the `prioritisetransaction` command. What is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `prioritisetransaction` command is used to accept a transaction into mined blocks at a higher (or lower) priority. It takes three arguments: `<txid>`, `<priority delta>`, and `<fee delta>`. This command allows you to adjust the priority of a transaction, which can be useful in certain situations.",
