    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about launching a new blockchain with Verus. What are the benefits of doing so with a bridge converter liquidity pool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen launching a new blockchain with a bridge converter liquidity pool using Verus, the benefits include:\n\n* A fully decentralized or centralized bridge converter liquidity pool that runs on the new blockchain, with all fees generated staying on the new blockchain.\n* Seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and other chains in the Verus network.\n* The ability to define a new blockchain with its own fees, consensus, and rules, while still being part of the larger Verus ecosystem.\n\nIt's a great way to create a new blockchain that's connected to the Verus network, but also has its own unique characteristics. Do you have any questions about how this works, or would you like to know more about crowdfunding currency launches on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, that's a great segue. How do crowdfunding currency launches work on Verus, and what happens if the minimum participation levels are not met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, crowdfunding currency launches allow you to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of your blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. This ensures that participants are protected and that the launch is successful. It's a way to ensure that your new blockchain gets the support it needs to be viable, while also protecting the people who want to participate. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that does. I think I have a good understanding of how Verus can be used to launch new blockchains. But can you tell me more about the Verus network itself? What is it, and what are its benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a system that allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. This enables public blockchains to be available to the world for merge mining and staking, allowing for unlimited scale and new use cases. The network uses Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, to provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation.\n\nIn short, the Verus network is a way for multiple blockchains to work together seamlessly, allowing for greater scalability and new possibilities. It's a powerful tool for creating new blockchain-based projects, and it has a lot of potential for growth and innovation. Do you have any more questions about the Verus network, or is there anything else I can help with?",
