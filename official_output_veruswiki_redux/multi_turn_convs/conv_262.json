    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a couple of questions about Verus on different operating systems. Where are the data directories for Verus on MacOS and Windows?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn MacOS, the data directories for Verus are located at `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST` and `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest`. On Windows, they are located at `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\VerusTest`. Do you need help with anything else?\n\n**User:**\nThanks, that's helpful. How do I launch the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch the Verus testnet, you can use the command `./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST`. This will get you up and running on the testnet. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nOne more question - what kind of license is Verus software released under, and what are the implications of this license?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus software is released under a permissive free software license, which grants users the freedom to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software. The license also includes a disclaimer of warranty, which means that the software is provided \"as is\" without any warranty, and the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any damages or claims arising from the use of the software. This license allows users to freely use and modify the software, but also means that they use it at their own risk. Do you have any other questions about Verus or its license?",
