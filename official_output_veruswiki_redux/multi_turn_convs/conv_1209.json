    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been digging into the options for running Verus and I have a few questions. What does the `-sendfreetransactions` option do when running Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-sendfreetransactions` option allows Verus to send transactions as zero-fee transactions if possible. This option is set to 0 by default, meaning it is disabled unless explicitly enabled. Do you have any other questions about Verus options?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What is the purpose of the `-spendzeroconfchange` option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-spendzeroconfchange` option allows Verus to spend unconfirmed change when sending transactions. This option is set to 1 by default, meaning it is enabled. Would you like to know about any other options?\n\n**User:**\nHow does the `-storagefeefactor` option affect the pricing of storage in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-storagefeefactor` option determines the pricing of storage in Verus. The default value is 6.0, which means that the storage fee is equivalent to 1 TransactionExportFee per 6 kilobytes of data. This factor can be adjusted to change the pricing of storage. Do you have any questions about storage in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `-txconfirmtarget` option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-txconfirmtarget` option determines how quickly transactions are confirmed in Verus. If the `paytxfee` option is not set, Verus will include a fee in transactions to ensure they are confirmed within a certain number of blocks. The default value is 2, meaning transactions are targeted to be confirmed within 2 blocks on average. Do you have any other questions about transaction confirmation?\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to transactions that are not mined within a certain number of blocks in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTransactions that are not mined within a certain number of blocks in Verus will become invalid. This number of blocks is determined by the `-txexpirydelta` option, which has a minimum value of 4 and a default value of 20 (pre-Blossom) or 40 (post-Blossom). Do you have any questions about transaction expiration?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `-walletbroadcast` option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-walletbroadcast` option determines whether the wallet in Verus will broadcast transactions. This option is set to 1 by default, meaning the wallet will broadcast transactions. Do you have any other questions about the wallet in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `-walletnotify` option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-walletnotify` option allows Verus to execute a command when a wallet transaction changes. The command specified can include a `%s` placeholder, which will be replaced with the TxID of the transaction. Do you have any questions about wallet notifications?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `-zapwallettxes` option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-zapwallettxes` option allows Verus to delete all wallet transactions and only recover those parts of the blockchain through a rescan on startup. The option takes a mode parameter, which can be set to 1 to keep transaction metadata (e.g. account owner and payment request information) or 2 to drop transaction metadata. Do you have any more questions about Verus options or configuration?",
