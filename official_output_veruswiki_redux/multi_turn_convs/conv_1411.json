    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in testing out the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge. How can I access it and convert or send cross-chain from Ethereum's Goerli to the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge, you can go to https://ethtest.verus.services. To use the bridge, you'll need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus. Then, you can use your MetaMask to convert or send cross-chain to the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds cool! But I think I messed up my testnet and want to start over. What do I need to do to reset my testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo problem! To reset your testnet, you'll need to:\n\n1. Close Verus and make sure no testnet daemon is running.\n2. Delete the following directories:\n\t* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`\n\t* On Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`\n\t* On Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` (or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`)\n3. Restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native).\n\nThat should do the trick!\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in tokenizing ID control using next-generation NFTs. What are the currency definition flags for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFor tokenizing ID control using next-generation NFTs, the currency definition flags you'll need are OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN. Additionally, the max supply is 1 satoshi, which is either pre-allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0. Here's an example command to define such a currency:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```\nDoes that help?",
