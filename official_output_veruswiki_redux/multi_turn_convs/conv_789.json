    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I just downloaded Verus and I want to make sure it's authentic. How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the signature. This will ensure that the download is authentic and has not been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for that! I've been using Verus for a while now, and I've noticed that my wallet is getting pretty large. I've heard that the `prunespentwallettransactions` command can help with that. What's the purpose of that command and the corresponding RPC API in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `prunespentwallettransactions` CLI command and RPC API in Verus provide a method for holders of very large wallets to prune older spent transactions, which can improve performance for wallets that may be slowing down due to size. By removing these older transactions, you can reduce the size of your wallet and improve its overall performance.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful! I've also been using the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands to verify signatures. How do I know if a signature is valid when using these commands?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the signature is valid, the result of the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command will be `true`. This indicates that the signature is authentic and has not been tampered with. If the result is anything other than `true`, you may want to investigate further to ensure the integrity of the signature.",
