    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to install the Verus software, but my antivirus software is flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a common issue! If your antivirus software flags the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", it's likely just a warning that you're installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. You can review resources like [https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/) and [https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/) to learn more about these false positives. It's a false alarm, and you can safely ignore the warning.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Thanks for the clarification! Another question: How can I verify the authenticity of my Verus software download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerifying the authenticity of your Verus software download is a great practice! To do so, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to your desired directory.\n\nThe packages are signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\", and a txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is included for each download. This ensures that the software you're installing is genuine and hasn't been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! How can I use the command line to verify a Verus software file or checksum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands to verify a Verus software file or checksum, respectively. Here are some examples:\n\n**Verifying a file directly:**\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AUo/FwABQR/8Mse5lnb7stZDIBtVu6/Wy3NyvKNKpyZv/2chp7bm1g9umtlqqpv6Zd3D8xMtLHjiOZpXgam8NpvR9g1WqvFO /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-5-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-5-x86_64.tar.gz\n```\n\n**Verifying using a checksum:**\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AUo/FwABQR/8Mse5lnb7stZDIBtVu6/Wy3NyvKNKpyZv/2chp7bm1g9umtlqqpv6Zd3D8xMtLHjiOZpXgam8NpvR9g1WqvFO 26b1c75156b4795505afc1236c1817bfa1dc15497d7ae952709b7345dd08659e\n```\n\nReplace the example values with your actual file path, signer identity, and checksum or signature. This will ensure that the file you've downloaded is genuine and matches the expected checksum or signature.",
