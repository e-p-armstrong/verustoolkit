    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into the features of Verus and I'm curious about Verus Vault. What is Verus Vault, and how does it prevent theft?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a staking-capable time locking feature that enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked. This allows users to specify an unlock delay, providing a theft-proof workflow. Users can also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID, adding an extra layer of security. This ensures that even if an ID is compromised, the funds associated with it will be safe until the unlock delay has passed.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a great feature. I've also been wondering, can VerusIDs be used as cryptocurrency addresses for multiple currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, VerusIDs can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. This means you can use a single VerusID to receive and manage multiple currencies, making it a convenient and streamlined solution.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that Verus allows users to create their own tokens or blockchains. What capabilities do users have when creating their own tokens or blockchains using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith Verus, users have a lot of flexibility when creating their own tokens or blockchains. They can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain. This blockchain will be 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant, and can be merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. This allows users to create their own customized blockchain solutions with a high degree of security and flexibility.",
