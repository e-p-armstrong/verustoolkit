    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I need some help with locking an ID in Verus. How do I do it using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo lock an ID in Verus using the command line, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nThis will set a time lock on the ID, which means it will be locked until the specified block height is reached. Do you have any further questions about locking IDs or using the command line?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I do. What's the difference between a time lock and a time delay in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, a time lock defines the unlock height of an identity, while a time delay defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. Think of it like this: a time lock says when an ID can be unlocked, while a time delay says how long to wait after that before it actually unlocks.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What happens to a locked identity when it is revoked in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a locked identity is revoked in Verus, its locked status is cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height that was set. So, revoking a locked ID effectively removes the lock.\n\n**User:**\nCan a locked identity revoke itself in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself in Verus. You need to use a different identity or authority to revoke a locked ID.\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to know more about the `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It's useful for finding currencies that can be used for conversions.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve converters for a specific currency pair, such as BTC and ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo retrieve converters for a specific currency pair, such as BTC and ETH, you can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API with the currency codes as arguments, like this:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold. Do you have any more questions about using the `getcurrencyconverters` API?",
