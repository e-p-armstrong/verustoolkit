    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some issues with my antivirus software. It's flagging the Verus software as a potential threat. What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a common issue! If your antivirus software flags the Verus software as a potential threat, it may be due to false positives. Verus is a mining software, and some antivirus software may detect it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program). This is a warning that you are installing mining software, which could be exploited by a third party to use your PC for mining. You can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives. You can also consider adding an exception to your antivirus software to allow the Verus software to run.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I was also wondering, is this release of Verus compatible with the PBaaS testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, this release of Verus does not support the PBaaS testnet. To participate in the PBaaS testnet, you need to use a specific version of Verus, such as the PBaaS Cross-chain Technology Preview. Make sure to check the Verus website for the correct version and instructions on how to participate in the testnet.\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing, what's the disclaimer for using Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer for using Verus software is that it is experimental and unfinished software, and you use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage. However, the software is open-source, and you are free to use, modify, and distribute it under certain conditions, including retaining the copyright notice and permission notice. Please review the license agreement and terms of use before using the software.",
