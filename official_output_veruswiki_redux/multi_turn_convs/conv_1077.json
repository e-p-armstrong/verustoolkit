    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand the `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves a list of all currencies that meet specific liquidity and reserve ratio criteria. It's a useful tool for finding currencies that are actively traded and have sufficient reserves.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What are the specific criteria for a currency to be included in the results of the `getcurrencyconverters` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo be included in the results, a currency must have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve and a VRSC reserve ratio greater than 10%. Additionally, the currency must have all listed currencies as reserves. These criteria ensure that the currencies returned by the API are liquid and have a strong reserve backing.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! How do I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve currencies that have markets for specific cryptocurrencies, such as BTC and ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API by running a command like the following:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return a list of all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold. You can replace `btc` and `eth` with any other cryptocurrency symbols you're interested in.",
