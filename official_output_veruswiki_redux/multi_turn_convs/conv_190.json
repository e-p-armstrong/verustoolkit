    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how to use some of the commands in Verus. Can you help me with the `listsinceblock` command? What is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listsinceblock` command is used to retrieve a list of transactions that have occurred since a specified block. It can be used to get a list of recent transactions, or to get a list of transactions starting from a specific block.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds useful. How can I use the `listsinceblock` command to get a list of transactions starting from a specific block?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `listsinceblock` command to get a list of transactions starting from a specific block by providing the block hash and the number of transactions you want to retrieve. For example, `verus listsinceblock \"000000000000000bacf66f7497b7dc45ef753ee9a7d38571037cdb1a57f663ad\" 6` would retrieve the 6 most recent transactions starting from the block with the specified hash.\n\n**User:**\nCan I use the `listsinceblock` command with a JSON-RPC request?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use the `listsinceblock` command with a JSON-RPC request. You can send a JSON-RPC request to the Verus server with the method `listsinceblock` and the required parameters, such as the block hash and the number of transactions to retrieve. For example, `curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"listsinceblock\", \"params\": [\"000000000000000bacf66f7497b7dc45ef753ee9a7d38571037cdb1a57f663ad\", 6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`\n\n**User:**\nI also saw the `listtransactions` command. What is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listtransactions` command is used to retrieve a list of transactions for a specific account, skipping a specified number of transactions from the start. It can be used to get a list of recent transactions for an account, or to get a list of transactions starting from a specific point in the account's transaction history.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `listtransactions` command to get a list of transactions for an account?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `listtransactions` command to get a list of transactions for an account by providing the account name, the number of transactions to skip, and the number of transactions to retrieve. For example, `verus listtransactions \"myaccount\" 0 10` would retrieve the 10 most recent transactions for the account \"myaccount\", starting from the beginning of the account's transaction history.",
