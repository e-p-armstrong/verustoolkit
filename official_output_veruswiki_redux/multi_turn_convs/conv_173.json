    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a new currency with Verus, and I was wondering, what does it mean to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new currency, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful! Now that I've set up my currency, how can I mint new coins?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command mints 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and sends them to the address \"mike@\".\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks! I'm almost ready to launch the Verus testnet. What steps should I take before launching it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBefore launching the Verus testnet, make sure to delete the following directories:\n* `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST`\n* `~/.verustest`\n\nThis ensures that you start with a clean slate and avoids any potential issues with previous testnet data. Once you've done that, you're good to go!",
