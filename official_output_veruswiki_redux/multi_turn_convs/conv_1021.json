    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I just downloaded Verus and I want to make sure it's legitimate. How can I verify the integrity and authenticity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the integrity and authenticity of a Verus download, you need to follow these steps: first, extract the downloaded archive. Then, verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. Finally, extract the archive to the desired directory. You can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to perform the verification. Do you have any questions about the process?\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the text file included with each Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe text file included with each Verus download contains the signer, standard SHA256 file checksum, and signature. This file is used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the download. It's an important step to ensure you're getting the real deal!\n\n**User:**\nWhat identity is used to sign Verus downloads?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus downloads are signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". You can check the signature against this identity to verify the authenticity of your download.\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about a new version, v0.9.9. What happens if I don't upgrade to it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't upgrade to v0.9.9, you will no longer be able to reliably connect to the mainnet after the first preparatory PBaaS upgrade is triggered. This upgrade is mandatory for both mainnet and testnet use, so it's important to stay up-to-date!\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the v0.9.9 release, anyway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.9.9 release is a preparation for the mainnet PBaaS release. It includes important updates and is mandatory for continued use of the mainnet and testnet. Upgrading to v0.9.9 ensures that you can stay connected to the network after the PBaaS upgrade is triggered. It's an important step to keep your Verus experience smooth and secure!",
