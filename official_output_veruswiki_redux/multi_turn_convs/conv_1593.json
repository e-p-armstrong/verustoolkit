    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a new currency in Verus and I was wondering what it means to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining the currency.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSetting `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency in Verus means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Do you have any other questions about defining a new currency in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! Now I'm wondering, how can I mint new coins in a currency I have defined in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins in a currency you have defined in Verus, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. For example, if you have defined a currency called \"mycoin\" and you want to mint 10,000 new coins, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis will mint 10,000 new coins and send them to the address \"mike@\". Do you have any questions about the `sendcurrency` command or minting coins in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! I think I'm ready to test out my currency. How do I launch a testnet in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a testnet in Verus, you can use the `verusd` command followed by the name of the chain you want to launch. For example, to launch a testnet called \"VRSCTEST\", you can use the following command:\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST\n```\nThis will start the testnet and allow you to begin testing your currency and transactions. Do you have any other questions about launching a testnet or testing your currency?",
