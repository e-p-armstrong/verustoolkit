    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into Verus and I'm curious about Verus Vault. What is Verus Vault, and how does it protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows you to lock a VerusID, making it impossible to spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked. Even with a private key, funds cannot be spent while the ID is locked. However, you can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards, and you can also receive new funds. The lock can be revoked and recovered by the revocation and recovery authority identities.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a great security feature! What are the requirements to enable Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable Verus Vault capabilities, you need to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This allows you to set up the necessary authorities to control the locking and unlocking of your VerusID.\n\n**User:**\nHow does Verus Vault protect against unauthorized access to funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault provides protection against unauthorized access to funds by requiring a waiting period (e.g., 24 hours) before funds can be spent or accessed after unlocking. This allows the revocation and recovery authority identities to detect and respond to unauthorized unlocks, effectively preventing theft.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really reassuring. What other benefits does Verus Vault provide beyond fund protection?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault also provides security for IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This allows for the preservation of blockchain wealth and assets across generations without the need for a bank.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really useful. One more question: how can I export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the command line and Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nThis command exports the ID \"IDNAME@\" to the PBaaS chain \"PBaaSChainName\" with an amount of 100 VRSCTEST.",

            "### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.
