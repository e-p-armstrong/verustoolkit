    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard of the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. Can you tell me more about it and how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. It allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT for the world to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, without the need for intermediaries. Users can pay or offer to pay from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, and accept payment to either type of address as well. This way, you have full control over your digital assets and can trade them securely.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great. I'm also interested in learning more about Verus Vault. What is it, and how does it protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a security feature that allows users to lock their VerusID, protecting funds from theft even if their private key is compromised. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the user cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. However, they can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. Additionally, they can still receive funds while the ID is locked. This adds an extra layer of security to your VerusID, giving you peace of mind knowing that your funds are safe.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful. I'm interested in using these features, but what are the requirements for enabling revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities on a VerusID, you must have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This is an essential step to ensure the security and flexibility of your VerusID. By setting up these IDs, you'll be able to take full advantage of the features Verus has to offer, including Verus Vault and the ID and NFT Marketplace.",
