    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm playing around with signature verification in Verus. What does the result `true` indicate when verifying a signature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result `true` indicates that the signature is valid. Simple as that! Do you have any other questions about signature verification or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I've been seeing some updates recommended for Verus. What's the main reason for the critical update to version 0.9.9-5, and why is it recommended to update as soon as possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main reason for the critical update to version 0.9.9-5 is a critical privacy fix that resolves an issue introduced in v0.9.9, which prevented parsing id@:private to the z-address of id@ when running a native node. This could impact on-chain privacy, so it's recommended to update as soon as possible to version 0.9.9-5 or later to ensure privacy is maintained. It's always a good idea to stay up-to-date with the latest versions to ensure the security and privacy of your assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been wondering, what additional capabilities does Verus provide, beyond its core blockchain functionality?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides several additional capabilities, including:\n\n1. On-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs.\n2. On-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming.\n3. On-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles.\n\nThese capabilities enable a wide range of use cases and applications on the Verus network. It's a very powerful and flexible platform! Do you have any other questions about Verus or its capabilities?",

Instead, such an address parsed to the main id@. Since this issue could impact on-chain privacy of someone intending to send to or from a private address and using friendly names, we are considering this a critical privacy release.This version also prevents the wallet from crediting transactions that can be constructed to make a burn look like a spendable output, ensuring that unspendable funds are not added to a wallet or address balance. @Alrighttt, who has been focusing on Verus security testing, reported a way that someone might create such an output, and we appreciate that it is before we have ever seen such transactions on the public or test networks. Thanks @Alrighttt for the report and discretion that helps keep them off the network(s) altogether! We recommend that everyone update as soon as possible to version 0.9.9-5 or later.We are working towards the mainnet PBaaS upgrade version 1.0.0, but we cannot put a specific date beyond \ud83d\udd1c on its release.### What\u2019s New for TestNet\nThis release fixes hopefully the last remaining issue that was causing testnet users to experience sync issues on PBaaS chains.There are no other significant changes.### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
