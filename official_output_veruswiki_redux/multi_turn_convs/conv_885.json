    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a new currency with Verus and I'm not sure what some of the settings mean. Can you help me out? Specifically, what does it mean when I set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency, it means that you are setting the proof protocol to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Does that make sense? Do you have any other questions about creating a new currency with Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that helps. So, if I set `proofprotocol` to 2, how can I mint new coins of that currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins of a currency that has PROOF_CHAINID as its proof protocol, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. The command should be in the following format:\n```\n./verus -chain=<chain_name> sendcurrency \"<currency_id>@' '[{\"address\":\"<address>\",\"currency\":\"<currency_name>\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":<amount}>]'\n```\nReplace `<chain_name>` with the name of the chain, `<currency_id>` with the ID of the currency, `<address>` with the address of the recipient, `<currency_name>` with the name of the currency, and `<amount>` with the amount of coins to mint.\n\nFor example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command would mint 10,000 new coins of \"mycoin\" and send them to the address \"mike@\". Does that help?",
