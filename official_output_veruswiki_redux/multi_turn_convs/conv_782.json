    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to define a new currency in Verus and I'm not sure what some of the settings mean. Specifically, what does it mean to set `proofprotocol` to 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new currency, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that helps clarify things. So, how can the controller of the chain ID mint new coins after setting `proofprotocol` to 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe controller of the chain ID can mint new coins by using the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option. For example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n\nThis command mints 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and sends them to the address \"mike@\". You can modify the command to fit your specific needs, but that should give you a general idea of how to mint new coins. Do you have any other questions about defining a new currency in Verus?",
