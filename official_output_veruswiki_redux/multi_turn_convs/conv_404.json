    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard about the notification oracle technology in the Verus network. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe notification oracle technology allows for selective triggering of notifications that can affect the behavior of nodes on the Verus network. In this specific case, it was used to disallow cross-chain operations without affecting same-chain operations, effectively preventing the launch of new PBaaS chains or Ethereum bridges until a certain condition is met.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What's the impact of the notification oracle on the Verus network, and what functions are still available?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe notification oracle does not affect same-chain operations, so all functions on the Verus network, except launching PBaaS chains or Ethereum bridges, are fully functional and unhampered. This means that users can still use the network as usual, but certain specific features are temporarily disabled.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the plan for removing the notification oracle, and what are the implications for users who have not upgraded to Verus version 1.0.5?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe plan is to remove the notification oracle once the community has had a chance to upgrade to Verus version 1.0.5. After the notification is removed, the network will become incompatible with Verus versions prior to 1.0.5. It is recommended that users upgrade to the latest version to ensure continued compatibility and access to all features. It's essential to stay up-to-date to take full advantage of the Verus network.",

            "The notification oracle technology allows for selective triggering of notifications that can affect the behavior of nodes on the Verus network. In this specific case, it was used to disallow cross-chain operations without affecting same-chain operations, effectively preventing the launch of new PBaaS chains or Ethereum bridges until a certain condition is met.",
            "Because we have the notification oracle technology, we triggered a rip-cord notification selectively for cross-chain that made all nodes listening to the oracle, which we expect to be near 100%, disallow cross-chain operations without affecting same chain operations. That means that all functions on the Verus network, except launching PBaaS chains or Ethereum bridges are fully functional and unhampered in any way at this time. If someone tries to launch a PBaaS chain while this oracle notification is active, all nodes following the oracle will reject such an action without incident until the notification is removed.This release, v1.0.5, properly calculates the aptly named \u201cmagic number\u201d for each chain, in the correct way on the mainnet network, and as long as the notification is set, is fully compatible with current versions on the network.Once everyone has had a chance to upgrade to v1.0.5, the network/community should agree to remove the notification from the oracle and allow PBaaS launches without false rejection of cross-chain challenges. Once we do that, and when someone launches a PBaaS chain that issues such a challenge, the network would become incompatible with Verus versions prior to 1.0.5.From our perspective, we are not aware of urgent efforts to launch a PBaaS chain in the next few days by anyone who cannot wait. All things considered, we believe that we can at least wait until the community discussion on Saturday, and that a strawman deadline would be **Monday, May 29th, at 19:00 UTC** for everyone to have upgraded. If you are urgently wanting to launch a PBaaS chain, have a plan, and are prepared to do so sooner, we invite you to join the community meeting on Saturday at 19:00 UTC and let everyone know.",
