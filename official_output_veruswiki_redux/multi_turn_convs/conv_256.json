    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about VerusIDs. I've got a multi-signature ID and I want to sign a transaction. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID on Verus, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction using the `sendcurrency` command and get the raw transaction data.\n2. Use the `z_getoperationstatus` command to get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n4. Use the `signrawtransaction` command to sign the raw hex transaction data on each wallet.\n5. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command.\n\nHave you tried following these steps? Do you have any issues or questions about the process?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. Thanks for the explanation. I've also been hearing about the new Verus testnet. What's that all about?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers a wide range of features. With the Verus testnet, you can create an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without needing to know how to program.\n\nYou can also send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease, convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange, and access the platform from Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets. The testnet even has a GUI for basic operations and a command line for more advanced functions.\n\nThe Verus testnet is a powerful platform that enables users to create and manage complex decentralized applications and systems. Are you interested in trying it out?",
