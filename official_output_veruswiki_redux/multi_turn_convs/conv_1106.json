    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still trying to wrap my head around how VerusIDs work. What is the benefit of using VerusIDs in terms of security and workflow?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs enable a virtually theft-proof workflow and provide a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. This is possible because users can revoke and recover an ID, and also create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID. It's a game-changer for security and workflow!\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds incredible. I've also heard that users can create their own tokens or blockchains using Verus. How does that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAny user with a VerusID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. This blockchain can be 50% POW/50% POS and 51% hash attack resistant. It's a powerful tool for users to create their own custom blockchain solutions.\n\n**User:**\nThat's amazing. I've also heard about Verus PBaaS blockchains. What's the advantage of using those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus PBaaS blockchains are merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. They also allow projects to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon, which means they start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities. It's a great way for projects to tap into the power of the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nSpeaking of DeFi, what's the purpose of DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi protocol allows ID owners to define fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage. This ensures that all currency conversions using a particular liquidity pool and mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. It also provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities. It's a powerful tool for creating complex DeFi solutions.",
