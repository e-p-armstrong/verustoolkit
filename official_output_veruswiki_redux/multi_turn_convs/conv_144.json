    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in learning more about how PBaaS chains operate within the Verus network. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects can choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. This allows them to start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. This setup provides a lot of flexibility and power to projects building on Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also been wondering about DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets in Verus. What's the purpose of those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets enable ID owners to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage. This ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing issues like miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, and providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers. It's a powerful tool for building decentralized finance applications on Verus.\n\n**User:**\nAnother thing I've been curious about is how simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches work in Verus. Can you walk me through that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen launching a new blockchain, a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool can be launched simultaneously as part of defining the new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but are bound to the launch of the new blockchain and run on the new blockchain. This allows for a smooth and integrated launch of new blockchains and liquidity pools, making it easier to build and deploy new decentralized applications on Verus.",
