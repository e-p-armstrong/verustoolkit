    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few questions about the Verus software itself. What kind of warranty or guarantee is provided with the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. I've also noticed that some antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! The Verus software is flagged as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) by some antivirus software because it is mining software. This does not necessarily mean that the software is malicious, but rather that it may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. These warnings are intended to inform users that they are installing mining software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I verify the safety of the Verus software downloads to make sure I'm not getting something malicious?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the safety of the Verus software downloads by checking the VirusTotal detection links provided for each platform (MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows). These links will show you the results of virus scans from multiple antivirus engines, helping you determine if the software is safe to download and use.",
