    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to learn how to use the Verus CLI commands. Can you help me with that? What's the general format for running Verus CLI commands?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe general format for running Verus CLI commands is `verus command \"<userinput>\"`, where `<userinput>` is replaced with your specific user data. Do you have any idea what kind of command you'd like to run?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! But I'm not sure how to enter these commands in my operating system. How do I enter Verus CLI commands in Windows, Linux, and MacOS?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGreat follow-up question! In Windows, enter the commands as shown without the surrounding quotation marks. In Linux and MacOS, precede the commands without surrounding quotation marks with `./`. So, for example, if you're running a command in Linux, it would look like `./verus command`.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification! Now, I'd like to create a new public address using the Verus CLI. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo get a new public address using the Verus CLI, run the command `verus getnewaddress`. This will generate a new public address for you.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful! Now, I'd like to see all my available public addresses. How do I list them using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo list your available public addresses using the Verus CLI, run the command `verus listaddressgroupings`. This will show you all your available public addresses.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about private addresses? How do I get a new private address using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo get a new private address using the Verus CLI, run the command `verus z_getnewaddress`. This will generate a new private address for you.\n\n**User:**\nI've got an R-address private key that I'd like to import into my wallet. How do I do that using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo import a VRSC private key of an R-address into your wallet using the Verus CLI, run the command `verus importprivkey \"<PRIVATE_KEY>\"`, replacing `<PRIVATE_KEY>` with your actual private key.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I'd like to check my current VRSC balance. How do I do that using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo get your current VRSC balance using the Verus CLI, you can run one of the following commands: `verus getbalance`, `verus z_gettotalbalance`, or `verus z_getbalance \"<z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>\"` to get the balance for a specific address.",
