    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have some questions about creating currencies and chains in Verus. Specifically, what is a limitation of using i-addresses when creating currencies in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen creating a currency, you cannot use an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. It is advised to avoid doing this, as it can cause problems in many cases and will not be supported for creating currencies. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! Another question I have is about creating a PBaaS chain in Verus. What is a GUI limitation when creating a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is specific to the GUI and will be resolved in future releases.\n\n**User:**\nI've got one more question. What action should I take if I have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current one?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current one, you should delete the VRSCTEST directory in your system's application support folder before running the new update. The exact directory path depends on your operating system: `~/.komodo/vrsctest` for Linux, `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest` for MacOS, and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` for Windows.\n\nPlease note that this is an essential step to ensure a smooth transition to the new version.",
