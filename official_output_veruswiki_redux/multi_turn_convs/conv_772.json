    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with VerusIDs and I'm trying to figure out how to sign transactions from a multi-signature ID. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign transactions from a multi-signature ID in Verus, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction using the `sendcurrency` command and get the raw transaction data.\n2. Use the `z_getoperationstatus` command to get the raw hex transaction data.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n4. Use the `signrawtransaction` command to sign the raw hex transaction data in each wallet.\n5. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command.\n\nDoes that make sense? Have you tried following those steps?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! I've also been hearing about the new Verus testnet. What features does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is really exciting! It offers a range of features, including:\n\n* Creation of new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Currency conversion without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way\n* A full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Accessibility from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets\n\nIt's a really powerful tool for building decentralized applications and ecosystems. Have you had a chance to try it out?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds amazing! What makes the Verus testnet unique compared to other cryptocurrency platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus testnet offers a range of features and capabilities that set it apart from other cryptocurrency platforms, including its ability to support an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains, as well as its decentralized and multi-chain architecture. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and customization, making it possible to create complex decentralized applications and ecosystems within the Verus network.\n\nIt's really a game-changer for the industry, and we're excited to see what developers and users will build with it. Do you have any other questions about the testnet or Verus in general?",
