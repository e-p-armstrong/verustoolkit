    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how ID registration fees work in different types of currencies. Can you tell me how decentralized and centralized currencies with a proof protocol of 2 issue IDs and handle ID registration fees?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDecentralized and centralized currencies with a proof protocol of 2 can issue IDs and handle ID registration fees in different ways. Decentralized currencies issue IDs as a decentralized operation, while centralized currencies can sell IDs using their own currency as the payment currency. Both types of currencies can set options for price, referrals, and permission from the currency identity required, which means the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps! How do fully decentralized fractional currencies handle ID registration fees?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFully decentralized fractional currencies handle ID registration fees by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves.\n\n**User:**\nCan the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies be set in a reserve currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves, such as USDC or DAI.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if more than the minimum price is paid for ID registration?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf more than the minimum price is paid for ID registration, the excess amount can be used to include VDXF key and contract bindings, allowing for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.\n\n**User:**\nHow do referral systems work for ID registration fees in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach currency can have multiple levels of referral support (up to 5 levels), which means that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies, or sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.",
