    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey! I'm still learning about Verus and I have a question about the `sendcurrency` API. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API is used to send and convert funds in Verus. It's a powerful tool that allows you to manage your assets across different currencies and addresses. Do you have any specific questions about how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually. How can I send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to the address `alice@`.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful! But what if I want to send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":...}]'\n```\nThis command sends VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients with friendly-name z-addresses.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what happens to testnet coins/currencies when VRSCTEST is reset?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. So, if you're working with testnet coins, be aware that they'll be wiped out when the testnet is reset.",
