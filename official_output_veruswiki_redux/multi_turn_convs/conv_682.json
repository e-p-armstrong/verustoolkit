    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having an issue with my antivirus software. It's flagging the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Any idea why this is happening?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's frustrating! Antivirus software might flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potential Unwanted Program) because it includes mining software, which could potentially be used by third parties to exploit your PC for mining purposes. This is a false positive warning, and you can learn more about it from resources like Malwarebytes and Kaspersky's blogs. You don't need to worry, it's just a precautionary measure by your antivirus software.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for clarifying that! I'm also curious about the latest release of Verus. What are some notable changes in this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome notable changes in this release of Verus include alleviating peer banning behavior, staking enhancements, and activation support for VerusID. Additionally, there have been relative adjustments to the CPU and FPGA-equalizing VerusHash 2.1 Algorithm. It's an exciting update that brings several improvements to the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nSpeaking of VerusID, can you tell me more about it? How does it differ from other blockchain ID implementations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusID is a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. VerusIDs provide opportunities for identity applications and offer features such as quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability, and privacy. It's a unique and powerful implementation that sets it apart from other blockchain ID systems.",
