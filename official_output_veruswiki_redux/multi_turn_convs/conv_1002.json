    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some issues with my antivirus software when trying to install Verus. Both Avast and Kaspersky are flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's frustrating! Your antivirus software may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it includes mining software, which could potentially be exploited by third parties to misuse your computer's resources. This is a false positive warning, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about it. It's nothing to worry about, and you can safely ignore the warning.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for clarifying that. I also noticed there was a recent update to the Verus software. What changes were made in the latest release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotable changes in this release include:\n\n1. The ability to enable optional VRSC or VRSCTEST chains as a parent of an ID.\n2. An update to the stratum protocol for mining to include solution information for miners, enabling smooth autoswitch and preparing for PBaaS merge mining.\n3. Minor issue fixes, including a listidentities issue on Mac and compatibility with pool mining.\n\nThese changes should improve your overall experience with Verus.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that there's an important update to the Verus mainnet protocol. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, this update is mandatory to remain on the Verus mainnet. If you don't upgrade, you may need to resynchronize the blockchain if you are running in native mode. The Verus mainnet protocol will hardfork at block 800200, and this update is necessary to ensure a smooth transition. Make sure to update to avoid any issues.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. I've been hearing about VerusIDs, but I'm not really sure what they are or what benefits they provide. Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. They provide plenty of opportunities for identity applications and are not controlled by a corporation, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. VerusIDs offer benefits such as revocability, recoverability, privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses on the Verus worldwide network. They're a powerful tool for managing your digital identity and assets.",
