    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to define a new currency in Verus and I'm not sure about one of the options. Can you help me out? What is the purpose of the `proofprotocol` option when defining a new currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `proofprotocol` option determines the protocol used to prove the ownership and validity of transactions on the currency's blockchain. In the example provided, `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which corresponds to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID has the authority to mint new coins. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about defining a new currency in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. How does the controller of a chain ID mint new coins in Verus? Is it a complicated process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot at all! The controller of a chain ID can mint new coins using the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option set to 1. For example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n\nThis command mints 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and sends them to the address \"mike@\". It's a relatively straightforward process. Do you have any more questions about minting new coins or Verus in general?",
