    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there, I have a few questions about using Verus. I was thinking of creating an ID with an i-address as its name. Is that a good idea?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I would advise against that. Creating an ID with an i-address as its name can cause problems when trying to use that ID or name in various cases, such as when referring to a currency. This is because an i-address will be interpreted as referring to a currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. It is not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name, as it may lead to user confusion. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, thanks for the warning. I was also thinking of creating a PBaaS chain with a name that is already used by a supported currency in Verus Desktop. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, in the current version of Verus Desktop, you cannot create a PBaaS chain with a name that is already used by a supported currency, such as BTC or ETH. However, this limitation is expected to be resolved in future releases. It's always a good idea to check the documentation and updates for the latest information on what's possible with Verus.\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing, I've been using the experimental and unfinished software of Verus. Are there any specific things I should be aware of when using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, it's very important to be aware that the software is experimental and unfinished, and use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur. It is recommended to use caution and follow best practices when using the software. Make sure to back up your data and be prepared for potential errors or issues. We're working hard to improve and stabilize the software, but for now, please be cautious when using it.",
