    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get some more information about my wallet. What information does the `getwalletinfo` command provide about my wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getwalletinfo` command provides a range of information about your wallet, including the wallet version, total confirmed balance, total confirmed reserve balance, total unconfirmed balance, total unconfirmed reserve balance, total immature balance, total immature reserve balance, eligible staking balance, a JSON object with currencies and their balances, total number of transactions, timestamp of the oldest pre-generated key in the key pool, number of new keys pre-generated, timestamp that the wallet is unlocked for transfers, transaction fee configuration, and the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the HD seed.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! How can I use the `getwalletinfo` command to retrieve information about my wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getwalletinfo` command in one of two ways: by running the command directly in the Verus CLI with `verus getwalletinfo`, or by using the Verus RPC interface with a tool like `curl`. For example, you can use the following command: `curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getwalletinfo\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`.\n\n**User:**\nI've got another question. What is the purpose of the `importaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `importaddress` command allows you to add an address or script (in hex) that can be watched as if it were in your wallet, but cannot be used to spend. This means that you can monitor the activity of an address without having control over it.",
