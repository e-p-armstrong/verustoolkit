    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about the Verus software itself. What kind of warranty or liability does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty or liability of any kind, express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. Would you like me to clarify anything about this?\n\n**User:**\nI see. Something else that's been bothering me is that my antivirus software keeps flagging the Verus software as suspicious. Why do some antivirus software, like Avast and Kaspersky, flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives. The Verus software is safe and legitimate, and these warnings are just a precaution taken by your antivirus software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But how can I verify the safety of the Verus software for myself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the safety of the Verus software by checking the VirusTotal scan results for the specific version of the software you are using. The links to the VirusTotal scans are provided for different operating systems, including MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows. These scans can help you determine if the software is safe to use. We also recommend keeping your antivirus software up to date and running regular scans to ensure your system is secure.",
