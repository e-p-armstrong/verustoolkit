    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nYou mentioned earlier that VerusIDs are more than just an ID system. Can you elaborate on what makes them more than that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. They provide opportunities for identity applications and are not controlled by a corporation, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. This gives users more flexibility and autonomy over their digital identities.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I'm also curious about how VerusIDs handle quantum attacks. Are they resistant to those kinds of attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, VerusIDs are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms. Although Verus currently does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, a quantum secure signature scheme is being integrated, which will allow IDs to be retroactively made quantum resistant when funds are sent to them. This is an important feature to future-proof Verus against potential threats from quantum computers.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also interested in using VerusIDs for sending and receiving funds. What are some benefits of using them for that purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. This provides a high degree of flexibility and control over digital assets.\n\n**User:**\nOne of the things that drew me to Verus was its decentralization. Can you tell me more about how VerusIDs fit into that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are fully decentralized, meaning anyone can create one and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without permission. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. This allows individuals to have full control over their digital identity and assets, which is a key principle of the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I was wondering about the advantages of the Verus ecosystem when it comes to managing funds in UTXOs. Are there any benefits to using Verus for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs. This provides an added layer of security and control over digital assets, which can be very valuable in certain situations.",
