    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nBefore I start using Verus, I want to know more about the software itself. What kind of warranty or guarantee does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What kind of liability do the authors or copyright holders of the Verus software have in case of any claims, damages, or other liability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders of the Verus software shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that some antivirus software might flag Verus as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's correct. Antivirus software like Avast or Kaspersky might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are some notable changes in the Verus software that I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome notable changes in the Verus software include: properly distributing initial contributions on non-reserve chains, showing the chain name on failure to notarize, continuing to attempt to notarize after running out of notary rewards, and fixing the getdefinedchains currency state.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. What is the focus of the Verus technology preview?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe focus of the Verus technology preview is on Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and Verus Reserve cross-chain currency conversion technology.",
