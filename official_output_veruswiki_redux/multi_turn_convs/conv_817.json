    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about how Verus supports private, internal blockchains. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus supports private, internal blockchains, which are easy to set up and can be bridged with public currencies. This allows organizations to have their own private network with all the features and currencies of the public chain, but without public access. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on the Verus network. Do you have any specific use cases in mind for private blockchains?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've got another question. How can I lock and unlock IDs on the Verus network, and what are the different types of locks available?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock and unlock IDs on the Verus network using the `updateidentity` command. There are two types of locks: Time Lock, which defines the unlock height of the identity, and Time Delay, which defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. A locked identity cannot revoke itself. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about ID locking?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. What is the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` API, and how can I use it to retrieve information about currencies on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. You can use this API to find currencies that meet specific liquidity thresholds. For example, you can use the command `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` to return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold. This can be really useful for finding reliable and liquid currency converters on the Verus network.",
