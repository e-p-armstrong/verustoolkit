    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to create a multisig address using Verus, and I'm not sure what arguments I need to provide. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a multisig address using Verus, you'll need to use the `createmultisig` command with two required arguments: `nrequired` and `\"keys\"`. `nrequired` is the number of required signatures out of the n keys or addresses, and `\"keys\"` is a json array of keys which are Komodo addresses or hex-encoded public keys.\n\nHere's an example of how to create a multisig address from 2 addresses:\n```bash\n> verus createmultisig 2 \"[\\\"RTZMZHDFSTFQst8XmX2dR4DaH87cEUs3gC\\\",\\\"RNKiEBduBru6Siv1cZRVhp4fkZNyPska6z\\\"]\"\n```\nDoes that help?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I was also wondering about the `estimatefee` command. What's its purpose, and how do I use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `estimatefee` command in Verus estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin confirmation within a specified number of blocks. You can use it by providing the number of blocks as an argument, like this:\n```bash\n> verus estimatefee 6\n```\nThis command returns an estimated fee-per-kilobyte, or the minimum fee if not enough transactions and blocks have been observed to make an estimate. It's a useful tool for planning your transactions and managing your fees.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I also had a question about the `estimatepriority` command. What's its purpose, and how do I use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `estimatepriority` command in Verus estimates the approximate priority a zero-fee transaction needs to begin confirmation within a specified number of blocks. You can use it by providing the number of blocks as an argument, like this:\n```bash\n> verus estimatepriority 6\n```\nThis command returns an estimated priority, or -1.0 if not enough transactions and blocks have been observed to make an estimate. It's another useful tool for planning your transactions and managing your priority.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. What's the purpose of the `invalidateblock` command, and how do I use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `invalidateblock` command in Verus permanently marks a block as invalid, as if it violated a consensus rule. You can use it by providing the hash of the block you want to invalidate as an argument, like this:\n```bash\n> verus invalidateblock \"block_hash\"\n```\nThis command marks the specified block as invalid, effectively removing it from the blockchain. Be careful with this command, as it can have significant consequences for your blockchain!\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",
