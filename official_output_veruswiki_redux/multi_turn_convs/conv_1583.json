    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi again, I've got some more questions about VerusIDs and Verus in general. What's a limitation of creating a currency from an ID in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! In Verus, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name (not its calculated ID). This is because using an i-address as a currency name can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used. To avoid confusion, it is recommended not to create IDs with i-addresses as their names. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question about the Verus Desktop GUI: are there any limitations to using existing currency names?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is a limitation. In the current version of the Verus Desktop GUI, you cannot use existing currency names like BTC or ETH as a PBaaS chain. However, this limitation is considered errata and will be resolved before mainnet availability, allowing users to create PBaaS chains with these names.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about using the Verus software in general? Are there any disclaimers or terms of use I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are. The Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and users are advised to use it at their own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage. However, the software is open-source, and users are permitted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software, as long as the enclosed copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. It's always important to read and understand the terms of use before using any software.",
