    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit concerned about the safety and legitimacy of the Verus software. What kind of warranty or liability does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI understand your concern. The Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Additionally, the authors or copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds a bit ominous. I've also noticed that my antivirus software is flagging the Verus software as a virus or malware. Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question. Antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these warnings.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But how can I verify the safety and legitimacy of the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can check the Virustotal links provided for each platform (MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows) to see the detection results from various antivirus engines. This can help you verify the safety and legitimacy of the Verus software.",
