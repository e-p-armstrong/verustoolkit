    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about Verus. What are some of the new capabilities that have been added to Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus has recently added several new capabilities, including:\n\n* On-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs\n* On-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming\n* On-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles\n\nThese new capabilities have greatly expanded the functionality of Verus and opened up new possibilities for users. Do you have any specific questions about these new capabilities or how they work?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. I've also heard about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. What is that, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. Users can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT for the entire world to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, allowing users to pay or offer to pay from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, and accept payment to either type of address as well. This decentralized model still allows for owners to share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership.\n\nThe marketplace is a game-changer for digital ownership and allows for a whole new level of flexibility and control for users. Would you like to know more about how it works or the benefits it provides to users?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please. What benefits does the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace provide to users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace provides several benefits to users, including:\n\n* Decentralized and peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries\n* Transparent and auditable transactions, while still allowing for private addresses\n* The ability to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain\n* The option to share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership\n\nThese benefits give users more control and flexibility over their digital assets, and open up new opportunities for monetization and collaboration. Do you have any other questions about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace or how it can be used?",

            "Thanks to ejuliano#8606 for suggesting the initial idea that led to the realization that these features could be added quite easily and with very little protocol risk. All of these new capabilities have had full coverage testing and validation over the past week thanks to @Asherda\u2019s leadership on that front.Meanwhile, @alexenglish, @monkins1010, @asherda, quipacorn#5205, and others have been working on the Ethereum bridge deployment in preparation for this release. The testnet will transition to the v1.0.1 protocol with no reset required, Monday, May 8, 2023 4:00:00 PM, UTC.\n### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.",
