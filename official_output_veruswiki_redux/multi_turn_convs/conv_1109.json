    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how VerusIDs can benefit token launches on Verus. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nToken launches on Verus can benefit from using VerusIDs by utilizing features such as vesting schedules in pre-allocations, percentage of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. This can make the launch process more efficient, secure, and attractive to participants.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard that Verus has unlimited scalability. What does that mean, and how is it achieved?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, which enables unlimited scalability. This is achieved through the use of Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, which provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be merge mined and staked, as well as private, internal blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with locking and unlocking IDs on Verus, but I'm not entirely sure how it works. Can you walk me through some of the key features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, IDs can be locked and unlocked using the `updateidentity` command. The `timelock` parameter can be used to define the unlock height of the identity (Time Lock) or the number of blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state (Time Delay). Additionally, revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height, and a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How do I actually lock an ID with a specific unlock height on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock an ID with a specific unlock height on Verus using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nReplace `<Unlock block height>` with the desired unlock height.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about setting a time delay for unlocking an ID on Verus? How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can set a time delay for unlocking an ID on Verus using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nReplace `<Unlock block delay>` with the desired number of blocks to delay the unlock.",
