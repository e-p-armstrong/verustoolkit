    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the warranty or liability for the software provided by Verus. What's the situation with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What's the purpose of this software release, and what's its compatibility with the Verus mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis software release is intended for testing and development with public blockchains as a service (PBaaS). Although it also works with the Verus mainnet, it does not support PBaaS on the mainnet and is not an official release. It should be used at your own risk and not as a main wallet.\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to define a new chain on the Verus testnet. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can define a new chain on the Verus testnet using the `definechain` command. Here is an example of a sample chain definition:\n\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [{\"reward\" : 10000000000}], \"notarizationreward\" : 1440000000, \"billingperiod\" : 1440, \"nodes\" : [{\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2500\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"\"}, {\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2501\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"RDyDzC5JB66Y29fzBkamywqEn1PJXTzj8B\"}]}'\n```\n\nDo you have any questions about this process or would you like more information?\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the minimum requirements for defining a chain on the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum requirements for defining a chain on the Verus testnet are:\n\n1. A maximum of 3 eras.\n2. A minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations.\n3. A minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.\n4. You need VRSCTEST in your wallet to create a chain.\n\nMake sure you meet these requirements before defining a new chain.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I connect to a defined chain on the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can connect to a defined chain on the Verus testnet by running the command:\n\n```\n./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\n\nOn the first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.\n\n**User:**\nWhere are the config files for PBaaS chains stored, and what's their purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe config files for PBaaS chains are stored in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME` directory, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain. The presence of a correct config file for any chain enables the chain to load as an independent chain.",
