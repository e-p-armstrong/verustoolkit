    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating a new currency on Verus. What is required for a currency launch to happen on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a currency on Verus, two main requirements need to be met. First, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST. Additionally, there must be at least 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specific rate (for example, 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) to launch the currency. Do you have any other questions about the currency launch process?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. How does the currency launch process work on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe currency launch process on Verus happens as part of the mining process. When a currency is launched, the mining of the blocks that launch the currency earns a 0.025% conversion fee, which is used to convert VRSCTEST to the new currency (in this case, GOLD). This ensures a smooth and decentralized launch process.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I convert VRSCTEST to a new token (like GOLD) on Verus before the token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to a new token (like GOLD) on Verus before the token launches by using the `sendcurrency` command with the `convertto` and `preconvert` options. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either receive the converted amount in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\n**User:**\nAlright, got it. How can I create a new token on Verus that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a new token on Verus that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST by defining the token's properties using the `definecurrency` command. The exact command and options will depend on the specific token you want to create. If you need more information or help with the command, feel free to ask!",
