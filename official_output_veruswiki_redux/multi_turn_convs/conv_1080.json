    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in learning more about how fundraising works during a blockchain launch. What happens to a currency that uses fundraising options during a blockchain launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a blockchain is launched with fundraising options, the native currency created will be fractionally backed. This means that its value will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more people convert from it. Do you have any further questions about fundraising during a blockchain launch?\n\n**User:**\nWhat if a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met? What happens in that case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met, no fundraising is received. The launch is essentially canceled, and participants get their funds back.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of something called a pre-launch discount. What is that, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA pre-launch discount is a feature that gives all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency. This is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about a pre-launch carve-out? I've heard of that too.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA pre-launch carve-out is a feature that enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price-neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing: what is pre-allocation, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPre-allocation is a feature that enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price-neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time-locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods. Does that make sense?",
