    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few questions about VerusIDs and how they work. How do I lock an ID with a time lock in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo lock an ID with a time lock in Verus, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter set to the desired unlock block height. Here's an example command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nDoes that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that does. But what's the purpose of the `timelock` parameter when setting flags to an unlocked state?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen setting flags to an unlocked state, the `timelock` parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock. So, it's essentially a way to schedule when an ID will become unlocked.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What happens to a locked identity when it is revoked in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a locked identity is revoked in Verus, its locked status is cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height. So, revoking a locked ID will immediately unlock it.\n\n**User:**\nCan a locked identity revoke itself in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself in Verus. You'll need to use another ID with the necessary permissions to revoke a locked ID.\n\n**User:**\nMoving on to a different topic, what does the `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieve in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies with specific markets in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies with specific markets by specifying the markets as arguments. For example, to find currencies with BTC/ETH markets, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
