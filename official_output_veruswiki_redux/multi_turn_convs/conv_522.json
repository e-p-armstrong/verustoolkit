    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I just downloaded Verus and I noticed a txt file included with the download. What's the purpose of that file, and how can I use it to verify the download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe txt file contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, which allows you to verify the authenticity and integrity of the download. You can use this file to verify the download by extracting the archive, verifying the signature using the extracted text file, and then extracting the archive to the desired directory.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know. How can I actually verify a Verus download using the command line and the signature file?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands to verify a Verus download. The `verifyfile` command takes the signer's identity, signature, and file path as arguments, while the `verifyhash` command takes the signer's identity, signature, and file checksum as arguments. The result will be `true` if the signature is valid. Would you like me to provide an example of how to use these commands?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I also noticed that there's a new version of Verus, v1.0.3. What's the significance of upgrading to this version, and what are some of the key changes and improvements in this version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUpgrading to v1.0.3 of Verus is actually mandatory for continued mainnet and testnet use. This version fixes some critical issues, including an edge case that could have resulted in unexpected behavior on mainnet, and forgives issues on testnet that were blocking challenge resolution. Additionally, v1.0.3 extends the API fundrawtransaction to allow for easier construction of transactions for DeFi conversions and cross-chain operations. It's essential to upgrade to this version to ensure continued functionality and security.",
