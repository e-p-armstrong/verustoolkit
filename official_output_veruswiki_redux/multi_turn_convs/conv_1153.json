    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there, I'm trying to define a PBaaS chain using the command line and Verus. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a PBaaS chain, you can use the `definecurrency` command with two JSON objects. The first object defines the PBaaS chain properties, and the second object defines the bridge properties. Here's an example command:\n\n```json\n./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"options\":330,\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\"],\"conversions\":[1],\"eras\":[{\"reward\":1200000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0}],\"notaries\":[\"Notary1@\",\"Notary2@\",\"Notary3@\"],\"minnotariesconfirm\":2,\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.111:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node1@\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.112:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node2@\"}],\"gatewayconvertername\":\"Bridge\",\"gatewayconverterissuance\":1000000}' '{\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\",\"PBaaSChain\",\"USD\"],\"initialcontributions\":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],\"initialsupply\":3000000}'\n```\n\nDoes this help? Do you have any other questions about defining a PBaaS chain?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What are some limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are two limitations to be aware of:\n\n1. You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. This can cause problems when referring to the currency or identity, and is generally not recommended.\n2. In the GUI, you cannot use the same name as a supported currency (such as BTC or ETH) for a PBaaS chain. This limitation will be resolved in a future release.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these limitations, or about working with multi-currency on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know, thanks! Can you explain why it's not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt's not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name because it can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used, such as when referring to a currency or identity. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.",
