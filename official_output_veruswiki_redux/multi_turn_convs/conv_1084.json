    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to use the `run signrawtransaction` command, but I'm not really sure what the output is supposed to look like. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe output of the `run signrawtransaction` command is a JSON object with two properties: `hex` and `complete`. The `hex` property contains the signed transaction data in hexadecimal format, and the `complete` property is a boolean indicating whether the transaction is fully signed. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps a lot, thanks! I've also been getting confused by the example commands and results in the documentation and guides. Should I just copy and paste those into my console?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you should not use the example command and result provided in the documentation. Instead, you should use the results from your own wallet and adapt the command to your specific situation. The examples are meant to illustrate how the command works, but they're not meant to be used verbatim. You should replace the example inputs and outputs with your own data to get the desired results.",
