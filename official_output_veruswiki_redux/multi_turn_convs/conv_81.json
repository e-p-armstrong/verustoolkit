    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard that there's a new upgrade to the Verus CLI, v0.7.2-4. What are some of the key features and improvements of this upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the key features and improvements of the v0.7.2-4 CLI upgrade include:\n\n* Support for friendly-name private z-addresses for sending and receiving funds and messages on mainnet and testnet.\n* The ability to use sapling addresses as native currency funding sources and destinations for any transaction using the `sendcurrency` command.\n* The ability to reference an identity's z-address as a funding source or destination by appending `:private` to an ID.\n* New wildcards can be used as funds sources in the `sendcurrency` command and parameters to `z_getbalance`, including `\"*\"` for all transparent addresses, `\"R*\"` for all R-addresses, and `\"i*\"` for all IDs controlled by the wallet.\n* The `sendcurrency` command is now an asynchronous API that returns an operation ID and completes in the background, with its status available through `z_getoperationstatus`.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these features or improvements?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I'd like to know more about friendly-name private z-addresses. What's the implication of using them in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using friendly-name private z-addresses in Verus, it's important to note that funds held on a private address or endpoint are not able to be redirected to the newly recovered ID unless you still have control over the z-address itself, due to the zero-knowledge nature of z-addresses. This is a fundamental limitation of zero-knowledge privacy and not an error. Transparent funds controlled by an ID are recovered when the ID is revoked and recovered, even if you have lost the keys.\n\nSo, essentially, when you use a private z-address, you need to keep in mind that you'll need to keep control of the z-address itself in order to recover funds sent to it. Does that make sense?",

This form of z-address will also be able to be used with the z_getbalance command.\n- New wildcards can also be used as funds sources in the 'sendcurrency' command and parameters to z_getbalance that include:\n  - All transparent addresses in the wallet (both R-addresses and IDs)\n    `\"*\"``\n  - All R-addresses in the wallet\n    `\"R*\"`\n  - All IDs controlled by the wallet\n    `\"i*\"`\n- `sendcurrency` will now be an asynchronous API that will return an operation ID, as `z_sendmany` does, and complete in the background. It will also have its status available through `z_getoperationstatus`.**NOTE:** Due to the zero knowledge nature of z-addresses, a z-address is an endpoint in your VerusID which can be changed if you revoke and recover an ID, funds held on a private address or endpoint are not able to be redirected to the newly recovered ID unless you still have control over the z-address itself. Transparent funds controlled by an ID are recovered when the ID is revoked and recovered, even if you have lost the keys. This is a fundamental limitation of zero-knowledge privacy, not an error and not something to be fixed. Please consider this when using friendly-name private addresses as funds and not just message endpoints.",
