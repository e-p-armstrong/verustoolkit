    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having some trouble with the `sendcurrency` API. Can you help me understand how to use it to send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the `sendcurrency` API, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to the address \"alice@\". Does that help clarify things for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps a lot, but what if I want to send VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to multiple recipients?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to multiple recipients using the `sendcurrency` API, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from all available wallet funds to both \"alice@\" and \"bob@\". Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand now. But what if I want to convert VRSCTEST to another currency? Can I do that with `sendcurrency`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can convert VRSCTEST to another currency using the `sendcurrency` API. To do so, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"TESTCOIN\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST to TESTCOIN and sends it to the address \"bob@\". Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really useful. What if I want to preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency before it is active?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency before it is active using the `sendcurrency` API, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\nThis command preconverts 10 VRSCTEST to NEWCOIN before it is active and sends it to the address \"alice@\", with a refund to \"alice@\" if the conversion fails. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI've got another question. What's required to create a currency of a specific name in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency of a specific name in Verus, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\n\n**User:**\nLast question. How can I define a new currency in Verus using the `definecurrency` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a new currency in Verus using the `definecurrency` command, you can use the following format:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency named \"gold\" with specific options, conversions, and preallocations.",
