    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about Verus's approach to blockchain security. Can you tell me about Verus Fee Pooling technology?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Fee Pooling technology is a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model that strengthens blockchain security. It preserves the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time. In this model, all fees from transactions in a block are gathered and added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees. The current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool. This approach addresses concerns about blockchain security and fee distribution, which have been raised by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What about Verus Vault? What is it, and what kind of use cases does it enable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a capability that provides advanced time locking of identities, enabling a theft-resistant workflow of identity management. It also enables various use cases, such as trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, estate planning, and more. When combined with the revocation and recovery capabilities of VerusID, the implications of Verus Vault are significant. It's a powerful tool that can be used in a variety of ways to enhance security and flexibility in identity management and asset control. Do you have any questions about how Verus Vault might be used in a specific scenario?",

In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
