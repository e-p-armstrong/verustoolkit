    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating my own currency on the Verus network. What are the requirements to launch a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a new currency on the Verus network, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST, and there must be 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specified rate (e.g. 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch. That's the basic requirement to get started.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks for letting me know! Can you walk me through the currency launch process on Verus? How does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe currency launch process on Verus happens as part of the mining process. When a new currency is launched, the mining of the blocks that launch the currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, which involves converting VRSCTEST to the new currency (e.g. GOLD). So, it's an integrated process that involves mining and conversion.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. How can I convert my VRSCTEST to a new currency (e.g. GOLD) before it launches? Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, it is possible! You can convert your VRSCTEST to a new currency (e.g. GOLD) before it launches by sending a command to park your conversion until the token launches. The command would look like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. It's a way to reserve your spot in the launch process.",
