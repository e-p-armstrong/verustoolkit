    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm wondering about the future of the testnet. What will happen to the current testnet when the next release is ready for a mainnet PBaaS activation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe current testnet will be left running and fully functional until the next and final testnet instance is ready, at which point it will be effectively abandoned. It will continue to run for a couple of weeks to overlap with the new testnet, allowing users to send currencies from the first testnet to the second via Ethereum's Goerli testnet. This will ensure a smooth transition and give users time to adapt to the new testnet.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I'm also curious about the capabilities of Verus. What are some additional capabilities of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus has several additional capabilities that make it a powerful and versatile platform. Some of these capabilities include:\n\n1. On-chain launches of token, centralized currency, and liquidity basket AMMs. This allows for the creation and deployment of new tokens and assets directly on the blockchain.\n\n2. On-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming. This enables the creation of new, independent blockchains that can interoperate with each other and with the Verus main chain.\n\n3. On-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles. This allows for the creation of decentralized identities that are fully under the control of the individual or organization, as well as the issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital assets.\n\nThese capabilities make Verus a highly flexible and powerful platform for building decentralized applications and services. Do you have any further questions about Verus or its capabilities?",
