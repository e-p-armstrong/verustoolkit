    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in using Verus software, but I want to know what I'm getting into. What's the current status of the software provided by Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is still in development and should be considered experimental and unfinished. This means it may have bugs or issues, and we recommend using it at your own risk. No warranty is provided for any kind of damage.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What are my rights as a user of Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou have the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so. However, you must include the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of warranty does Verus provide for their software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides no warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a bit concerning. Can I at least check the software for viruses or malware before using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, Verus provides links to VirusTotal, a website that scans files for viruses and malware, for each platform (MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows). You can use these links to check the software before downloading and using it.",
