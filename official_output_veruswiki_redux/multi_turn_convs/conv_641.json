    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have some questions about VerusIDs and Verus Vault. What are the requirements to enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities, you must have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. Does that make sense? Do you have any other questions about Verus Vault?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How does a locked VerusID work in terms of revocation and recovery?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. This means that even if someone with only the primary keys (even a multisig of primary keys) tries to access the funds, they must first unlock the ID and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access the funds.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really useful! What security benefits does Verus Vault provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault provides a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery. It also offers protection for IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This means that you can protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, without the need for a bank.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of time locks, but I'm not sure what they're for. What is the purpose of setting an unlock delay on a locked ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSetting an unlock delay on a locked ID provides a decentralized solution to the infamous 5-dollar wrench attack. This means that if an unauthorized unlock occurs, the revocation and recovery authority identities can revoke and recover the ID, preventing the unauthorized access to the funds.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. How can I export an ID to a PBaaS chain using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\n\nThis command exports the ID \"IDNAME@\" to the PBaaS chain \"PBaaSChainName\". Does that help?",
