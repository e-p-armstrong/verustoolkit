    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble using Verus on my Windows machine. Can you help me with formatting my commands in the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help. To properly format your commands in the Windows command line when using Verus, you should use specific syntax and formatting rules. For example, you can use the following format: `verus-cli command [options]`. This should help you get started. Do you have any specific commands you're trying to run, or would you like more information on the available options?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! I was also wondering, where are the standard locations for Verus-Desktop installations on Windows?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe standard locations for Verus-Desktop installations on Windows are \"C:\\Program Files\\Verus\" and \"%AppData%\\Verus\". Knowing these locations can help you troubleshoot issues or find the files you need to configure your Verus setup. If you need to access any configuration files or data, you should be able to find them in one of these locations. Do you have any other questions about Verus or its installation on Windows?",
