    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the structure of a Verus block template. Can you help me with that? Specifically, what does the \"depends\" field in a transaction object represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"depends\" field in a transaction object in a Verus block template represents an array of numbers that specify the transactions that must be present in the final block if this one is. These are the transactions that this transaction depends on, and they are identified by their 1-based index in the 'transactions' list.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the \"fee\" field in a transaction object? What does that represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"fee\" field in a transaction object in a Verus block template represents the difference in value between the transaction inputs and outputs, measured in Satoshis. For coinbase transactions, this is a negative number representing the total collected block fees (excluding the block subsidy). If this field is not present, the fee is unknown and clients should not assume there isn't one.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What about the \"required\" field in a transaction object? What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"required\" field in a transaction object in a Verus block template is a boolean that indicates whether this transaction must be included in the final block. If it is true, the transaction is required to be included.\n\n**User:**\nMoving on to the block template itself, what does the \"target\" field represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"target\" field in a Verus block template represents the hash target, which is a string that specifies the target hash for the block.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the \"mintime\" field in a Verus block template?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"mintime\" field in a Verus block template represents the minimum timestamp appropriate for the next block time, measured in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, GMT).\n\n**User:**\nLast one: what does the \"mutable\" field in a Verus block template represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"mutable\" field in a Verus block template is an array of strings that specifies the ways in which the block template may be changed. Examples of ways the block template may be changed include 'time', 'transactions', and 'prevblock'.",
