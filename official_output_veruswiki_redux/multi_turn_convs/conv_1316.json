    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how the Linux version of Verus Desktop works. Can you tell me where it's stored and how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Linux version of Verus Desktop is supplied as an AppImage, which means it doesn't get installed, but instead is mounted in the `/tmp` folder when executed. The mounted folder will have a name like `.mount_Verus-xxxxx`, where the `xxxxx` part is a random set of characters that changes on every start of the wallet. This folder is hidden, and you can toggle its display by pressing `<CTRL>-H`.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. I was also wondering, why should I be careful when modifying files in the Verus Desktop installation folders?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! Modifying files in the Verus Desktop installation folders can result in a corrupt installation. Therefore, you should only do so when instructed by the Verus support community members. It's always better to be safe than sorry!\n\n**User:**\nI see. Where are the daemons located in the Verus Desktop installation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe daemons are located in the `komodod`, `verusd`, and `zcashd` folders, which can be found in the `resources/app/assets/bin/linux64` subfolder of the mounted program folder.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about the program settings. Where does Verus Desktop store its program settings?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Desktop stores its program settings in the `~/.verus-desktop` folder, specifically in the `appdata/config.json` file.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. I was also wondering about the standard chain data and wallet locations for Verus and Komodo. Do you know where those are?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe standard chain data and wallet locations are:\n* For KMD: `~/.komodo`\n* For Verus: `~/.komodo/VRSC`\n* For Komodo asset chains: `~/.komodo/<CHAIN-NAME>`, where `<CHAIN-NAME>` is the official name of the asset chain in capital letters.\n\n**User:**\nLast question: how can I easily access the binaries folders, Verus Desktop program settings, and VRSC chain folder?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the debug menu in Verus Desktop to easily access the binaries folders, Verus Desktop program settings, and VRSC chain folder. It's a convenient way to access those folders without having to navigate through the file system.",
