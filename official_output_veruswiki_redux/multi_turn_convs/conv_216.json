    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about creating currencies in Verus. What is the requirement for creating a currency with a specific name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency with a specific name in Verus, you need to have an ID with the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once.\n\nSo, for example, if you want to create a currency called \"MyCoin\", you would need to have an ID called \"MyCoin\" and be the controller of that ID. Does that make sense?",

The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start.
