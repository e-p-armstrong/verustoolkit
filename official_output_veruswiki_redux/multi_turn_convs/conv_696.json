    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about the new blockchain on Verus, and I'm curious about how fees work. How do fees generated through cross-chain fee conversions or liquidity pool usage benefit the new blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFees generated through cross-chain fee conversions or liquidity pool usage are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This means that the new blockchain benefits directly from these fees, without having to share them with the Verus blockchain. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about fees or the new blockchain?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering about what happens if a blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launch doesn't meet the minimum participation levels.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launch does not meet the minimum participation levels by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees. This ensures that participants are protected in case the launch is not successful. It's a way to ensure that people aren't left out of pocket if a launch doesn't take off.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the features available for blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches on Verus? I've heard it's quite flexible.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides several features for blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches, including:\n\n* Minimum participation levels in preferred currencies\n* Automatic refunds if minimum participation levels are not met\n* Maximum participation limits in one or more currencies\n* Pre-launch discounts\n* Price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs\n* Vesting schedules for pre-allocations\n* Price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds\n\nThese features provide a high degree of flexibility and customization for launching new currencies on the Verus network. It allows for a lot of control and flexibility when setting up a launch.\n\n**User:**\nI think I have a good understanding of the features, but I'm still a bit unclear on the bigger picture. What is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what are its benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a decentralized network that allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. This network enables the creation of public and private blockchains, which can be used for various use cases and can scale indefinitely. The benefits of this network include:\n\n* Unlimited scalability\n* Interoperability between blockchains\n* Decentralized bridge confirmation using Notary IDs\n* Easy setup of private, internal blockchains\n* Seamless bridging of public currencies into private networks\n\nThis network provides a flexible and scalable infrastructure for building blockchain-based applications on Verus. It's a really powerful tool for creating custom blockchain solutions. Do you have any more questions about the Verus network or its benefits?",
