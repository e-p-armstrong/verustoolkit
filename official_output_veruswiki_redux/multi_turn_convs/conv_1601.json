    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been learning about DeFi and I have some questions about how Verus addresses some of the common issues in the space. How does the Verus DeFi protocol address the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities. By doing so, Verus DeFi prevents MEV and front-running, creating a more fair and transparent environment for all users.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've heard of \"bridge\" converter liquidity pools in the context of Verus DeFi. Can you explain what those are?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool in the context of Verus DeFi is a fully decentralized or centralized liquidity pool that is launched along with a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but are bound to the launch of the new blockchain and run on the new blockchain. All fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, providing seamless connectivity.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been looking into crowdfunding currency launches on Verus. Can you explain how those work, and what happens if the minimum participation levels are not met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, crowdfunding currency launches allow you to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of your blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, and price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies. This way, you have full control over the launch of your currency and can ensure that it meets the necessary participation levels to be successful.",
