    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to wrap my head around the different types of IDs on Verus. Can you explain the differences in capabilities between Native IDs and IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNative IDs, which are registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, can launch currencies on that blockchain and, if on Verus, actual independent blockchains. IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies, on the other hand, cannot launch currencies but are still valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs, as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features, proofs, brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. Are there any exceptions to the rule that non-native IDs cannot create currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is an exception. *.veth gateway IDs, which are available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter, can create Ethereum-mapped currencies. These IDs offer a special case where non-native IDs can create currencies.\n\n**User:**\nHow are *.veth IDs registered, and what is the purpose of the registration fees?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n.veth IDs are registered at a price level that prevents misuse and supports bridge liquidity. All fees, except for the 1 VRSC import fee which goes into the mining and staking fee pool, go to the bridge converter liquidity basket. This ensures that the registration process is secure and sustainable.\n\n**User:**\nI'm excited to try out some of these features on the testnet. What features are currently available on the testnet, and how can I participate in the launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll features mentioned, including currency creation, ID-restricted clubs, governance groups, and businesses, are currently enabled on the testnet. You can participate in the launch at no actual cost as a testnet liquidity provider, get some nice testnet IDs, launch your own currencies, or start your exclusive ID-restricted club, governance group, or business. Stay connected on the #pbaas-development channel for more information.\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the testnet, but now I want to start fresh. How can I reset my testnet on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your testnet, make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon is running), delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native). This will give you a clean slate to experiment with again.",
