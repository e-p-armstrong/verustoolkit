    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm thinking of using Verus on my Mac, but I'm not sure if it's compatible with my version of OSX/macOS. What versions of OSX/macOS are supported by Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Desktop is only officially supported on macOS 10.12.x and later versions. While it may be possible to install on OSX 10.11.x or earlier, the wallet will not function properly and will not complete the initial sync. I'd recommend checking your macOS version and upgrading if necessary.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the Verus CLI wallet? Is it compatible with older versions of OSX/macOS?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the Verus CLI wallet should run without issues on lower versions of OSX/macOS. So, if you're running an older version, the CLI wallet might be a better option for you.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! If I do decide to use Verus on my Mac, where can I find the wallet and data files?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus wallet and data files are located at `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC` on a Mac. Just replace `<username>` with your actual username, of course!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! What if I made a mistake and installed Verus on an unsupported version of OSX/macOS (10.11.x or earlier) and need to remove it? What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf that's the case, don't worry! To remove Verus, follow these steps:\n\n1. Quit the wallet.\n2. Eject the wallet dmg.\n3. Make a backup of `wallet.dat` and `VRSC.conf` if necessary.\n4. Move the `Agama.app` to the trash if installed.\n5. Delete the `~/Library/Application Support/Agama` and `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo` folders.\n6. Upgrade your OS.\n7. Install Agama.\n\n**User:**\nWhy do I need to make a backup of `wallet.dat` and `VRSC.conf`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou should make a backup of `wallet.dat` and `VRSC.conf` only if you had a wallet on this machine or if you used an existing `wallet.dat`. This will ensure that you don't lose your wallet data when removing Verus from an unsupported version of OSX/macOS. It's always a good idea to be safe than sorry when it comes to your wallet data!",
