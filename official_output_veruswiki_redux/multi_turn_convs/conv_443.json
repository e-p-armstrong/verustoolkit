    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I was wondering, what kind of warranty or liability does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. This means that you use the software at your own risk, and the authors and copyright holders are not responsible for any issues that may arise.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for clarifying that. I did have another issue, though. When I tried to install the Verus software, my antivirus software flagged it as malicious. Is that a problem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because Verus is a mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, these warnings are false positives and do not indicate that the software is malicious. You can safely ignore these warnings and continue with the installation.",
