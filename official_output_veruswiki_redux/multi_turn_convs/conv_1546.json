    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. Can you tell me more about it and how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain. It allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the blockchain for everyone to see. The platform enables peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Users can execute transactions from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, and still have the ability to audit their transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting! What about security, though? I've heard of Verus Vault - what is it, and how does it protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows users to lock their VerusID, protecting their funds from theft or unauthorized access, even if their private key is compromised. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, users cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. However, users can still receive funds and stake their locked funds on the Verus network to earn rewards.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I'd like to enable these features on my own VerusID. What are the requirements for enabling revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities on a VerusID, users must have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. That's the basic setup needed to take advantage of these advanced security features.",
