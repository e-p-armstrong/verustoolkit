    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to download and install Verus, but my antivirus software is flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's likely a false positive warning. This warning is indicating that the software is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is not a virus, but rather a warning about the potential usage of the software. Don't worry, Verus is safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But how can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download to make sure it's legitimate?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nThe packages are signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Testing@\". You can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command in the Verus CLI to verify the download.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands used for in the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands are used to verify the authenticity of a Verus download. The `verifyfile` command verifies the signature of a file, while the `verifyhash` command verifies a checksum of a file. This ensures that the download has not been tampered with and is from a trusted source.\n\n**User:**\nWhat information is included in the txt file that accompanies each software download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe txt file includes the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, which can be used to verify the authenticity of the download.",
