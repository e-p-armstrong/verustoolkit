    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi! I'm having some trouble with Verus. I want to get the current price and other currency statistics for the most recent block using the command line. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo get the current price and other currency statistics for the most recent block, you can use the `getcurrencystate` command with the following format:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate\n```\n\nJust copy and paste that into your command line, and you should get the information you need. Do you have any other questions about getting currency statistics?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What if I want to get currency statistics for a specific block?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo get currency statistics for a specific block, you can use the `getcurrencystate` command with the following format:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\n\nReplace `blocknum` with the number of the block for which you want to get the currency statistics. For example, if you want to get the statistics for block 1000, you would use `./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate 1000`. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! What if I want to get currency statistics for a range of blocks with a specific period between them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo get currency statistics for a range of blocks with a specific period between them, you can use the `getcurrencystate` command with the following format:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```\n\nReplace `startblocknum` with the number of the starting block, `endblocknum` with the number of the ending block, and `blockstostep` with the period between blocks. For example, if you want to get the statistics for blocks 1000 to 2000, stepping by 100 blocks, you would use `./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate 1000,2000,100`. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. What if I need to refund contributions made to a failed PBaaS chain launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo refund contributions made to a failed PBaaS chain launch, you can use the `refundfailedlaunch` command with the following format:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME\n```\n\nReplace `CHAINNAME` with the name of the failed PBaaS chain. For example, if the failed chain was named \"MyChain\", you would use `verus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch MyChain`. This command will refund the contributions made to the failed launch.",
