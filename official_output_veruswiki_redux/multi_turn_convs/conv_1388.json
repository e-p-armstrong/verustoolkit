    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I tried to download Verus, but my antivirus software flagged it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a valid concern! Antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your computer. These warnings are meant to inform you that you are installing mining software. However, rest assured that Verus is a legitimate and safe software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But how can I be sure I'm getting the real deal and not some malware? How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can also use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the download. The `verifyfile` command takes the signer's identity, the signature, and the file path as arguments. The `verifyhash` command takes the signer's identity, the signature, and the file hash as arguments.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the deal with the txt file that comes with each Verus download? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe txt file included with each Verus download contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. This information can be used to verify the authenticity of the download using the Verus CLI or other tools. It's an extra layer of security to ensure you're getting the genuine Verus software.",
