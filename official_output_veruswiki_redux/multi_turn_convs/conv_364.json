    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few questions about the Verus network. What's the fee for conversions on the Verus network, and where does it go?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe fee for conversions on the Verus network is 0.025%. This fee is distributed 100% to miners and stakers. So, the people who help maintain the network get rewarded for their work.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've heard of something called an \"implied volatility fee\" - what's that, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAn implied volatility fee is a fee that's planned to be added to the Verus network in the future. This fee will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, meaning that blocks that significantly change the price of a currency will pay more of an implied volatility fee. The purpose of this fee is to ensure that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers' risk with earnings from implied volatility fees.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What about currency launches on the Verus network? How do those work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrency launches on the Verus network are designed to be similar to Kickstarter campaigns, with minimum participation requirements to activate the launch. If the minimum is not met, the launch is automatically refunded. The launch pricing is dynamic and based on participation, with pre-launch participation price discounts and pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts available. Additionally, price-neutral launch pre-allocations can be specified.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What kinds of currencies can be launched on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrencies can be launched on the Verus network to accept a range of other currencies, and with or without fractional reserve capabilities. So, there's a lot of flexibility in terms of what kind of currencies can be created and used on the network.",
