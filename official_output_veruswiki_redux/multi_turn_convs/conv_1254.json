    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having a bit of a wallet management issue. I have multiple `wallet.dat` files and I'd like to consolidate them into one. How can I do that in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo consolidate multiple `wallet.dat` files into one, you need to follow these steps: \n\n1. Load one of the wallets and issue the command `z_exportwallet FILENAME` to export the wallet.\n2. Copy the generated file to the machine that hosts your main wallet.\n3. Issue the command `z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/EXPORTFILENAME` on the main Verus-cli to import the exported wallet.\n\nThis should help you consolidate your wallets. Do you have any further questions about this process or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I'm not sure where to find some of the Verus files like `wallet.dat`, Chaindata, and `VRSC.conf`. Can you tell me where they're usually located?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe standard locations for Verus files vary depending on the operating system. Here are the typical locations:\n\n* Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC`\n* Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`\n* OS independent through Verus Desktop: Click `help`, `Show Verus data folder (default)`\n\nYou should be able to find the files you're looking for in one of these locations. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! Now, I'd like to export a wallet. What command should I use to do that in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo export a wallet in Verus, you should use the command `z_exportwallet FILENAME`, replacing `FILENAME` with the desired name for the exported file. Note that the filename cannot have a `.` in it.\n\nDo you have any questions about this command or the export process?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's clear. But where will the exported wallet file be saved?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe exported wallet file will be saved in the same directory as the config file and wallet.dat file, or in a location specified by `exportdir` in VRSC.conf.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how do I import an exported wallet in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo import an exported wallet in Verus, you should use the command `z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/EXPORTFILENAME`, replacing `/LOCAL_PATH/EXPORTFILENAME` with the path to the exported file.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, can I use these commands in different Verus interfaces?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use these commands in different Verus interfaces, including:\n\n* CLI wallet: `./verus z_exportwallet FILENAME` & `./verus z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/FILENAME`\n* Verus Desktop: `run z_exportwallet FILENAME` & `run z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/FILENAME` in `settings`, `coin settings`\n* Verus Agama: `z_exportwallet FILENAME` & `z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/FILENAME` in `settings`, `<CLI>`\n\nYou should be able to use these commands across different Verus interfaces. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!",
