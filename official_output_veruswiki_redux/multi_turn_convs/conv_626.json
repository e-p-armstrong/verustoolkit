    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few questions about fundraising and launches on Verus. What happens to fundraising if a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met, no fundraising is received. The funds are simply returned to the participants.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What's a pre-launch discount, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA pre-launch discount is a discount offered to participants who contribute to the launch before it goes live on its start block. This discount is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency remains in demand when it goes live. It's a way to incentivize early adopters and build momentum for the launch.\n\n**User:**\nInteresting. What about pre-launch carve-outs? How do those work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA pre-launch carve-out enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price-neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch. It's a way for the launching entity to receive a portion of the funds raised during the launch process.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And finally, what's pre-allocation, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPre-allocation enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price-neutral manner, and is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time-locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods. It's a way to allocate a portion of the newly launched currency to specific entities or individuals, which can be useful for various purposes such as rewarding early contributors or incentivizing development.",
