    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into the Verus protocol and I'm curious about the `sendcurrency` API. What does it allow you to do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in the Verus protocol is quite powerful. It allows you to send tokens through the Verus network. One of its key features is that it supports all currencies in the network, which makes it very versatile. Additionally, it enables token launches with various features, such as accepting multiple currencies for conversion, setting different conversion prices, and defining minimum and maximum participation levels. This gives you a lot of control over how your tokens are launched and managed.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really useful. How can tokens be controlled in the Verus protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTokens in the Verus protocol can be either fully blockchain-controlled or partially blockchain-controlled, which gives you a lot of flexibility. With minting capabilities available to the controlling ID at any time, you have a high degree of control over your tokens. Furthermore, the controlling ID can also receive aggregated outgoing transactions to external systems, allowing for control over currency supplies in various use cases.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What is required to create a currency of a specific name in the Verus protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. This ID serves as the controller of the currency, so it's an important step in the process.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What happens if the minimum participation levels are not met by the currency's start block during a token launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the minimum participation levels are not met by the currency's start block, all participation will be refunded, minus a minimal transfer/network fee, which is allocated to miners/stakers. So, you don't have to worry about losing your investment if the minimum participation levels aren't met.",
