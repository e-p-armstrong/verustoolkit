    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating my own currency on the Verus network. What are the requirements to launch a new currency on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a new currency on Verus, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST. Additionally, the currency must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specified rate (e.g. 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch. This launch process happens as part of the mining process, where mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new currency.\n\nDo you have any other questions about launching a new currency, or would you like to know more about the process?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. How can I convert VRSCTEST to a new currency, like GOLD, before it launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to a new currency, like GOLD, before it launches by using the `sendcurrency` command with the `convertto` and `preconvert` options. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. Would you like to know more about the `sendcurrency` command or converting currencies?\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens after a new currency launches on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter a new currency launches on Verus, the only way to create new tokens is through a centralized issuance option. You can convert VRSCTEST to the new currency using the `sendcurrency` command. Additionally, you can create new currencies that can be converted to with either the new currency or VRSCTEST. So, you'll have a lot of flexibility to create and manage your own currencies within the Verus ecosystem. Do you have any more questions about managing currencies on Verus?",
