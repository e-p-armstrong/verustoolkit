    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have another question about VerusIDs. What is the purpose of a locked VerusID, and how can it be protected from unauthorized access?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA locked VerusID provides an additional layer of security for funds and assets. Even with primary keys, including multisig primary keys, the ID must first be unlocked and then wait for a predetermined unlock time before funds can be spent or accessed. This allows for a decentralized solution to protect against unauthorized access, such as the \"5-dollar wrench attack\". The revocation and recovery authority identities can always revoke and recover the locked ID, circumventing the lock.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've heard of Verus Vault, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. How does Verus Vault enhance the security and recovery of funds, IDs, and NFTs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault provides a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery for IDs, NFTs, and other assets. It enables the use of time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, users can protect and recover their funds, preserving their assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, without the need for a bank.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I think I understand what you mean by \"time locks\". Can you explain the benefit of setting a delay on unlocking a locked ID, and how does it compare to traditional banking security?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSetting a delay on unlocking a locked ID, such as a 24-hour delay, provides an additional layer of security against unauthorized access. This is similar to the security provided by a bank, but in a decentralized manner. It gives the revocation and recovery authority identities, or a third-party service, time to detect and respond to any unauthorized unlock attempts, thereby protecting the funds and assets associated with the ID.",

            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock.

This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs.
