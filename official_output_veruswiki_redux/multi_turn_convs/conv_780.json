    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in using VerusIDs, but I want to make sure they're secure. How do VerusIDs ensure the security of funds sent to them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If the controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. This ensures that the security of funds sent to a VerusID is tied to the security of the controlling addresses, giving you control over who can access the funds.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great. I've heard that quantum computers could potentially break some cryptographic algorithms. What makes VerusIDs resistant to quantum attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and a quantum secure signature scheme is being integrated, which will make it possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. This means that even if quantum computers become a reality, VerusIDs will be able to withstand attacks from them, keeping your funds safe.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that VerusIDs are revocable. What does it mean for a VerusID to be revocable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach VerusID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity itself, and has the permission to revoke the identity, creating a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft. This means that if your VerusID is compromised, you can revoke it and prevent any unauthorized access to your funds.",
