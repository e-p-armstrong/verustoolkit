    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to manage my shielded addresses in Verus. How can I get a list of all Sprout and Sapling shielded addresses associated with my wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_listaddresses` command to get a list of all Sprout and Sapling shielded addresses belonging to your wallet. This command returns a JSON array of strings, where each string is a zaddr belonging to the wallet. You can also include watchonly addresses by setting the `includeWatchonly` argument to `true`. Do you have any other questions about managing your shielded addresses?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! I'm also trying to keep track of some operations in my wallet. What is the purpose of the `z_listoperationids` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_listoperationids` command returns a list of operation ids currently known to the wallet. You can filter the result by the operation's state by specifying the `status` argument. This command is useful for tracking the status of various operations in your wallet. It's a handy tool for keeping tabs on what's going on in your wallet. Do you have any other questions about operations or transaction tracking?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do! How can I get a list of amounts received by a specific zaddr belonging to my wallet using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_listreceivedbyaddress` command to get a list of amounts received by a specific zaddr belonging to your wallet. This command takes two arguments: the private address and an optional `minconf` argument, which specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for a transaction to be included in the result. This command can help you keep track of the amounts received by a specific shielded address. Do you have any more questions about tracking transactions or shielded addresses?",
