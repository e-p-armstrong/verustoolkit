    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with some commands and I'm not entirely sure what one of them does. Can you help me out? What happens when I use the command `sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis command effectively parks your conversion of VRSCTEST to GOLD until the GOLD token launches. After the launch, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.",
