    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been using VRSCTEST for a while, but I haven't updated in a bit. What should I do if I have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current update, I recommend that you delete the following directories before running this new update: `~/.komodo/vrsctest` for Linux, `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest` for MacOS, and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` for Windows. This will ensure a smooth transition to the latest version. Do you have any other questions about updating VRSCTEST?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually, I do. What kind of warranty or guarantee does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. Essentially, you use the software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What about my rights as a user of the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAs a user of the Verus software, you are granted permission to deal in the software without restriction, including the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so, subject to the conditions that the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.
