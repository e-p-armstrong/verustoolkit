    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, but I'm not entirely sure what it is or how it works. Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. It allows users to advertise their offers to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post their sale publicly for anyone to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized and peer-to-peer manner, without the need for intermediaries. Users can make payments from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, which are still auditable by them.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What are the benefits of using the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace offers several benefits, including decentralized and peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Users can also make payments from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, and transactions are auditable for added security and transparency. Additionally, users can select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about Verus Vault. How does it protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows users to lock their VerusID, protecting their funds from theft even if their private key is compromised. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the user cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. However, they can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. Additionally, they can still receive funds.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a great feature. What are the requirements for enabling Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable Verus Vault capabilities, including revocation, recovery, and other features, users must have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.",
