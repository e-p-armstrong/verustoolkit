    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about Verus Vault and how it protects my funds on a VerusID. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a security feature that allows you to lock your VerusID, protecting your funds from theft, even if your private key is compromised. When locked, you cannot spend funds from that identity, but you can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. You can also still receive funds. This provides an additional layer of security to safeguard your assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great. What are the requirements to enable Verus Vault capabilities, including revocation, recovery, and locking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable Verus Vault capabilities, you need to have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation and recovery ID configured. This ensures that you have the necessary setup to take advantage of the security features provided by Verus Vault.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Can a locked VerusID be revoked and recovered, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, a locked VerusID can be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which can circumvent the lock. This means that even if someone tries to unlock your funds without authorization, the revocation and recovery authorities can step in and recover your funds.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" before. How does Verus Vault protect against that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault provides protection against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" by allowing you to set a delay time (e.g., 24 hours) before funds can be spent or accessed after unlocking. This gives the revocation and recovery authorities time to detect and respond to unauthorized unlock attempts, effectively preventing the attack.\n\n**User:**\nWhat other security features does Verus Vault provide, besides locking and revocation/recovery?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault provides additional security features, including time locks for purposes such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance, as well as protection for your IDs and NFTs. These features provide a comprehensive security solution for your digital assets on the Verus network. Do you have any more questions about Verus Vault or its features?",

            "#### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",
