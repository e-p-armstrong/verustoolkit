    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have some questions about Verus and its capabilities. How do the fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool work on a new blockchain created with Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn a new blockchain created with Verus, all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain itself, with no rent or fees going back to the Verus blockchain. This means that the new blockchain has full control over its own fees and revenue streams, with seamless connectivity to the Verus network. Do you have any other questions about this or new blockchains?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How do blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches work with Verus, and what happens if the minimum participation levels are not met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith Verus, blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches can be set up with minimum required levels of worldwide participation in specific currencies on the chain. If the minimum participation levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees. This ensures that launches are fair and transparent, with built-in safeguards for participants. Does that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nAnd what are some of the advanced features available for blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches with Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers a range of advanced features for blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches, including maximum participation levels in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, vesting schedules for pre-allocations, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. These features provide a high degree of customization and flexibility for launch organizers. Do you have any other questions about this or blockchain-based crowdfunding?\n\n**User:**\nFinally, could you explain the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what are its key benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a decentralized network that allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. This network enables the creation of public blockchains available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can be easily set up with bridging of public currencies into an organization's internal network. The key benefits of this network include unlimited scale, seamless connectivity, and decentralized bridge confirmation via Notary IDs. I hope this answers your question! Let me know if you need more information.",
