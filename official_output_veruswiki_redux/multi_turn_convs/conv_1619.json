    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `submitmergedblock` command, but I'm not sure what the possible results are or what they mean. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you run the `submitmergedblock` command, there are a few possible results you might see. Let me walk you through them.\n\n**User:**\nPlease do! I'd love to know what they mean.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe possible results of the `submitmergedblock` command are:\n\n1. `{ rejected: \"reject reason\" }`, which indicates that the block submission was rejected, along with the reason for the rejection.\n2. `{ blockhash: \"hex\", accepted: true, pbaas_submissions: { \"Quantum\":\"chainID_hex\",... } }`, which indicates that the block was accepted and submitted to both Verus and PBaaS chains.\n3. `{ blockhash: \"hex\", accepted: \"pbaas\", pbaas_submissions: { \"Quantum\":\"chainID_hex\",... } }`, which indicates that the block was accepted and submitted only to PBaaS chains.\n\nSo, depending on the result, you'll know whether your block was accepted or rejected, and if it was accepted, which chains it was submitted to.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Thanks for explaining!",
