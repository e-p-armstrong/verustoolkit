    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about sending VRSCTEST using the `sendcurrency` API. How can I send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from a single address (e.g., bob@) to a single recipient (e.g., alice@) using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nDoes that help? Do you have any more questions about sending VRSCTEST?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! What about sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to multiple recipients?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to multiple recipients (e.g., alice@ and bob@), you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nGot it? Do you have any more questions about sending VRSCTEST?\n\n**User:**\nI have another question. How can I convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency (e.g., VRSC-BTC), you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any more questions about converting VRSCTEST?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I convert VRSCTEST to another reserve through a fractional currency using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to another reserve (e.g., BTC) through a fractional currency (e.g., VRSC-BTC), you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nGot it? Do you have any more questions about converting VRSCTEST?\n\n**User:**\nI have another question. How can I preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency that is not yet active using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency that is not yet active (e.g., NEWCOIN), you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any more questions about preconverting VRSCTEST?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. What is required to create a currency of a specific name on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency of a specific name on Verus, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.",
