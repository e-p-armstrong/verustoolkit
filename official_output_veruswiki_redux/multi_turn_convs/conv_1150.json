    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to define a new currency in Verus, and I'm not sure what some of the options mean. Specifically, what does it mean when I set `proofprotocol` to 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency in Verus, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about defining currencies or proof protocols?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, I do. How can I mint new coins for a currency I've defined in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins for a currency you've defined in Verus, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option. For example, if you've defined a currency called \"mycoin\" and you want to mint 10,000 new coins to an address \"mike@\", you can use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n\nThis command will mint 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and send them to the address \"mike@\". Make sure to replace \"mycoin\" and \"mike@\" with your actual currency and address, respectively. Do you have any more questions about minting new coins or using the `sendcurrency` command?",
