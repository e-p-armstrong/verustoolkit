    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been using Verus for a while now, and I've noticed that some antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it includes mining software, which can be used to exploit a PC if installed by a third party. This is a warning to the user, not an indication of malicious intent. So, it's just a precautionary measure taken by the antivirus software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I've also been hearing about an upcoming hard fork on the Verus mainnet protocol. What's the significance of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe upcoming hard fork at block 800200 on the Verus mainnet protocol is a mandatory update that requires all users to upgrade their software. Failure to do so may result in the need to resynchronize the blockchain if running in native mode. This update includes activation support for VerusID and the VerusHash 2.1 algorithm. So, it's essential to upgrade your software to ensure a smooth transition.\n\n**User:**\nSpeaking of VerusIDs, I've been wondering what they are and how they differ from traditional blockchain ID implementations. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, VerusIDs do not involve a corporation in the protocol. They provide opportunities for identity applications and offer features such as quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses, revocability, recoverability, and privacy. In short, VerusIDs offer a more decentralized, private, and secure way to manage your digital identity.",
