    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about creating currencies in Verus. What is a limitation of creating a currency from an ID in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne limitation of creating a currency from an ID in Verus is that you cannot make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about creating currencies in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's a good point. Why is it not recommended to make an ID with an i-address as its name in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt is not recommended to make an ID with an i-address as its name in Verus because it can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used, and it will not be supported for creating currencies. This is to reduce potential user confusion. It's better to keep things clear and avoid any potential issues. Do you have any more questions about IDs or i-addresses in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. I do have a question about creating a PBaaS chain in the Verus GUI, though. What is a limitation of creating a PBaaS chain in the Verus GUI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata and will not be a limitation in future releases. We're always working to improve the GUI and make it more user-friendly. Do you have any more questions about creating PBaaS chains or the Verus GUI?\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. What kind of software is Verus, and what are the implications of using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus is experimental and unfinished software. This means that it should be used at your own risk, and there is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur. However, the software is open-source and can be freely used, modified, and distributed, as long as the copyright notice and permission notice are included. We're still developing and improving Verus, but we're excited about its potential. Do you have any more questions about Verus or its development?",
