    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI was reading about UTXOs and notes in Verus, and I was wondering, how does Verus limit the number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging can be limited by the caller. The transparent limit parameter can be set to control this. If the transparent limit parameter is set to zero, the number of UTXOs is limited based on the size of the transaction, but only after Overwinter has activated. Before Overwinter, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option determines the number of UTXOs.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thank you! I was also wondering about the maximum transaction size in Verus. How does it change over time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe maximum transaction size in Verus is 100,000 bytes before Sapling activates, and 2,000,000 bytes once Sapling activates. This is a consensus rule that constrains any limits set by the caller or other parameters.\n\n**User:**\nSo, it seems like the Overwinter and Sapling activations have an impact on these limitations. Can you explain how they affect the limitations on UTXOs and transaction sizes in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Overwinter activation changes how the number of UTXOs is limited. Before Overwinter, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option determines the number of UTXOs, but after Overwinter, the transparent input limit of zero means the number of UTXOs is limited based on the size of the transaction. The Sapling activation increases the maximum transaction size from 100,000 bytes to 2,000,000 bytes.",
