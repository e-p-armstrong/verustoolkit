    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring the Verus documentation and I came across some flags that I'm not entirely sure about. Can you help me understand what the `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY` flag does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY` flag, with a value of 64, is used to restrict a PBaaS chain or gateway to a single currency. This flag is useful when you want to limit the functionality of a chain or gateway to only work with one specific currency. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that helps. What about the `OPTION_GATEWAY` flag? How does it affect the behavior of a Verus chain or gateway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_GATEWAY` flag, with a value of 128, is used to indicate that a chain or gateway routes external currencies. When this flag is set, the chain or gateway is configured to handle external currencies, allowing for more flexibility and interoperability with other currencies.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What about the `OPTION_PBAAS` flag? What does it indicate about a Verus chain definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_PBAAS` flag, with a value of 256, indicates that a chain definition is a PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) chain. This flag is used to distinguish PBaaS chains from other types of chains or gateways in Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. I've also seen the `OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER` flag. What's its purpose in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER` flag, with a value of 512, indicates that a specific PBaaS gateway is the default converter and will publish prices. This flag is used to configure the behavior of a gateway in a PBaaS setup, allowing it to act as a price publisher and converter.\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand. What about the `OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER` flag? How does it affect the behavior of a Verus gateway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER` flag, with a value of 1024, determines where top-level ID and currency registration occur. When this flag is not set on a gateway, registration happens on the launch chain. This flag is used to control the registration process for IDs and currencies in a Verus gateway.\n\n**User:**\nLast question: what's the purpose of the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` flag in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` flag, with a value of 2048, indicates that a token is a single satoshi NFT (Non-Fungible Token) token, which tokenizes control over the root ID. This flag is used to create unique, non-interchangeable tokens that represent control over a specific ID in Verus.",
