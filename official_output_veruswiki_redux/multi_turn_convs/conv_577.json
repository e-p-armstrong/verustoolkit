    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a new currency in Verus, and I was wondering what it means when I set `proofprotocol` to 2.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency in Verus, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. How can I mint new coins of a currency that I defined with `proofprotocol` set to 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins of a currency that you defined with `proofprotocol` set to 2, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. The format of the command is:\n```\n./verus -chain=<chain_name> sendcurrency \"<currency_id>\" '[{\"address\":\"<recipient_address>\",\"currency\":\"<currency_name>\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":<amount_to_mint}]'\n```\nReplace `<chain_name>` with the name of the chain, `<currency_id>` with the ID of the currency, `<recipient_address>` with the address of the recipient, `<currency_name>` with the name of the currency, and `<amount_to_mint>` with the amount of coins to mint.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to mint 100 new coins of a currency called \"MyCurrency\" on a chain called \"MyChain\" and send them to an address called \"MyAddress\". The command would look like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=MyChain sendcurrency \"MyCurrency\" '[{\"address\":\"MyAddress\",\"currency\":\"MyCurrency\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nDoes that make sense?",
