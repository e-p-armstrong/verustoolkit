    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been thinking about creating a new blockchain using Verus, and I have some questions about how fees work. How do fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool work when using a new blockchain created with Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain itself, without any rent or fees going back to the Verus blockchain. This allows for seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and the Verus network. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! Another thing I've been considering is crowdfunding a currency launch. What features does Verus offer for crowdfunding currency launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers a range of features for crowdfunding currency launches, including:\n\n1. Minimum participation requirements: set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on-chain.\n2. Automatic refunds: if minimum participation is not met, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees.\n3. Maximum participation limits: set maximum participation limits in one or more currencies.\n4. Pre-launch discounts: offer discounts to early participants.\n5. Price-neutral pre-allocations: allocate currencies to select IDs, increasing the fractional reserve ratio, without affecting the price.\n6. Price-neutral carve-outs: carve out proceeds without affecting the price.\n7. Vesting schedules: include vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs.\n\nThese features should help you with your crowdfunding needs. Do you have any further questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's really helpful, thanks! I've also been trying to understand the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network better. Can you tell me more about what it is and what its capabilities are?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a decentralized network that allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. It enables:\n\n1. Public blockchains: available for merge mining and staking, accessible to the world.\n2. Private blockchains: easy to set up, with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization's internal private network and back.\n3. Unlimited scalability: there is no limit to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n4. Decentralized bridge confirmation: provided by Notary IDs, specified at chain definition.\n\nThis network allows for seamless interaction between different blockchains, making it a powerful tool for creating a wide range of blockchain-based applications.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really powerful. What's the main benefit of using Verus for creating multiple blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe benefit of using Verus for creating multiple blockchains is that it allows for unlimited scale and interoperability between blockchains, without any limitations. This enables the creation of a vast network of blockchains that can operate and interact with each other seamlessly. This can lead to a wide range of innovative use cases and applications.",
