    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how Verus handles fees generated through cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool on a new blockchain created using Verus. What happens to these fees?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGreat question! Fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool on a new blockchain created using Verus are earned on the new blockchain itself, with no rent or fees going back to the Verus blockchain. This allows for seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been wondering about blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches on Verus. How do they work, especially in terms of minimum participation and refunds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches allow you to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimum levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees. This ensures that launches are successful and participants are protected.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about customization options for currency launches on Verus? Are there any besides minimum participation levels?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn addition to minimum participation levels, Verus offers various customization options for currency launches, including maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really flexible. What's the main benefit of the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network in terms of scalability and use cases?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, enabling unlimited scale and new use cases. This network enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that are easy to set up and bridge with public currencies.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how do notary IDs contribute to the functionality of the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling seamless interoperability between blockchains on the Verus network. This allows for public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that are easy to set up and bridge with public currencies.",
