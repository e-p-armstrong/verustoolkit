    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a question about signing transactions from a multi-signature ID on Verus. How can I do that, both on the testnet and mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID on Verus, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction using `verus sendcurrency` and specify the multi-signature ID as the sender.\n2. Get the raw transaction data using `verus z_getoperationstatus`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n4. Use `verus signrawtransaction` to sign the raw transaction data with each additional wallet.\n5. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.\n\nThis process should work on both the testnet and mainnet. Do you have any other questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for that! I've also been curious about the new Verus testnet. What are the key features of it, and how can I access it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that allows for:\n\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Easy creation of new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Sending currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Converting currencies to others on the network without an exchange\n\nYou can access the Verus testnet from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets. It's a great way to test and experiment with the Verus platform without using real assets. Have you tried it out yet?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. What makes the Verus platform unique compared to other cryptocurrency platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus platform stands out from other cryptocurrency platforms due to its ability to support an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains, as well as its ease of use and flexibility. Additionally, Verus allows for seamless transactions and conversions across different blockchains and currencies, making it a powerful tool for decentralized applications and use cases. Its decentralized and multi-chain architecture sets it apart from other platforms, offering a high degree of flexibility and customization. Do you have any other questions about Verus or its features?",
