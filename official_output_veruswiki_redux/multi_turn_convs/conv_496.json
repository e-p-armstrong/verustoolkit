    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm excited about the recent v0.9.2 release of Verus. Can you tell me what features are now complete in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith the v0.9.2 release, the Verus network, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols are considered feature complete. This means that the core protocol features are now fully implemented and ready for use.\n\n**User:**\nThat's awesome! What's the focus of the core developers now that the protocol features are complete?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNow that the protocol features are complete, the core developers are focusing on protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets, as well as merge mining for pool servers.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about some new features in Verus Desktop. What's this new feature that allows users to visualize the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new feature in Verus Desktop is a 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on chain and cross-chain. This visualizer allows users to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions, providing a better understanding of the network.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the Verus testnet? Are there any new capabilities available with the v0.9.2 release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, all PBaaS capabilities, including those for application development, are now available on the new Verus testnet. This includes interoperability features, such as the upcoming Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge, which will allow for seamless interaction between different blockchain networks.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really cool! What's the purpose and significance of Verus's new testnet, and how do its capabilities benefit developers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new testnet and its capabilities are significant because they provide a platform for developers to test and deploy their applications using Verus's transformative technologies. This allows developers to get a head start on using Verus's features, including PBaaS capabilities, before they are available on the mainnet.",
