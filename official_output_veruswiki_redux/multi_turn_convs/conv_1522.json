    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm new to the whole token launch thing. What are some features that can be included in a token launch using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nToken launches on Verus can include features such as pre-conversions, maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Additionally, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations using VerusIDs. This allows for more flexibility and customization in the token launch process.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard about the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a decentralized network that allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. This network enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can be easily set up with bridging of public currencies. The benefits of this network include unlimited scale, ease of setup, and seamless interaction between public and private blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What's the role of Notary IDs in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs are specified at chain definition and provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains to be easily set up with bridging of public currencies. They play a crucial role in facilitating interaction between different blockchains on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nI've got another question. How can I lock and unlock IDs on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock and unlock IDs on the Verus network using the `updateidentity` command. Specifically, you can use the `timelock` parameter to define the unlock height of the identity (Time Lock) or to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state (Time Delay).\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the `timelock` parameter when updating an ID on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `timelock` parameter serves two purposes when updating an ID on the Verus network. It can be used to define the unlock height of the identity (Time Lock), or to specify how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state (Time Delay). This allows you to have more control over the locking and unlocking process of your IDs.",
