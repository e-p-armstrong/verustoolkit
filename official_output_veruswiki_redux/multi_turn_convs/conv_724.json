    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been having some issues with my antivirus software. Why might antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Antivirus software may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it includes mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about the issue. It's just a precautionary measure, but rest assured that Verus is safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been wondering about something else. What is the significance of block 800200 in the Verus mainnet protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAt block 800200, the Verus mainnet protocol will undergo a hard fork, and it is mandatory to upgrade to the latest software version to remain on the Verus mainnet. If you don't upgrade, you may need to resynchronize the blockchain if you are running in native mode. So, make sure to keep your software up to date to avoid any issues!\n\n**User:**\nYou mentioned VerusIDs earlier. Can you tell me more about what they are and what makes them different from other blockchain ID implementations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID is a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. VerusIDs provide opportunities for various identity applications, offering features such as quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses, decentralization, revocability, recoverability, and more. They're a game-changer in the world of digital identities!",
