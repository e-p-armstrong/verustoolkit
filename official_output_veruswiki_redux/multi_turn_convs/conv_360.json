    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm playing around with testnet coins on Verus and I want to make sure I'm doing everything correctly. What should I keep in mind when working with testnet coins/currencies on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen working with testnet coins/currencies on Verus, keep in mind that they have no value and will disappear whenever the VRSCTEST network is reset. So, don't get too attached to your testnet coins!\n\n**User:**\nGot it! Thanks for the heads up. Now, I want to try sending some testnet coins around. How can I use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient by running the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to the address \"alice@\".\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful! What if I want to send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients? How can I do that using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients by running the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":1}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST to \"alice@:private\" and 1 VRSCTEST to \"bob@:private\" from all private wallet funds.",
