    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about the Verus software itself. What kind of warranty or guarantee does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty or guarantee, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that you use the software at your own risk, and we don't make any promises about its performance or functionality.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What kind of liability do the authors or copyright holders of the Verus software have in case of any claim or damages?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders of the Verus software shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. In other words, we're not responsible if something goes wrong while you're using the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've noticed that my antivirus software flags the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's because the Verus software is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a warning, not a detection of malware. Your antivirus software is just being cautious and alerting you to the possibility of unwanted activity.\n\n**User:**\nWhere can I find more information about these false positives that may be triggered by my antivirus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about the false positives triggered by your antivirus software by reviewing the resources provided, such as the Malwarebytes blog post on PUP.Optional.BitcoinMiner and the Kaspersky blog post on \"Not-a-virus\". These articles should give you a better understanding of why your antivirus software is flagging the Verus software and what it means for your system.",
