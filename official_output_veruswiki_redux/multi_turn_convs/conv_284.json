Would you like me to explain more about the `getcurrencyconverters` command?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that would be helpful. What is the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` command is used to find all currencies on the Verus network that have markets for a specific pair of currencies.
