    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the \"sendcurrency\" API on Verus, and I noticed some differences between the mainnet and Testnet. What's the main difference between the two?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"sendcurrency\" API on Verus Testnet has been enhanced with new multi-currency parameters, allowing for more complex currency conversions and interactions. This makes the Testnet API more flexible and powerful than the mainnet version.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about these new parameters? What are the two main parameters of the \"sendcurrency\" API on Verus Testnet, and what do they do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe two main parameters of the \"sendcurrency\" API on Verus Testnet are:\n\n1. \"currency\":\"currencyname\" - This specifies the source currency of the send. The default on testnet for currency name is \"vrsctest\".\n2. \"convertto\":\"currencyname\" - This allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source.\n\nThese parameters give you more control over the currency conversion process.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. How does the conversion rate work when using the \"sendcurrency\" API on Verus Testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nConversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a group of import blocks are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, ensuring fairness and transparency.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about fees? Are there any fees associated with using the \"sendcurrency\" API on Verus Testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are fees involved. There is a fee of 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. Additionally, an implied volatility fee is planned to be implemented, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee.",
