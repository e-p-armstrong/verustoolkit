    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having some trouble with my Verus wallet. I'm not sure what's going on, but I think it might have something to do with forking, network problems, or maybe I just have an old version of the wallet. Do you know what I should do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSorry to hear that! If you're experiencing issues with forking, network problems, or having an old version of the wallet, I recommend referring to the Verus wiki's FAQ section, specifically the article on \"Recover from forking, network or old wallet problems\". This article provides guidance on how to resolve these issues. Have you already checked the wiki, or would you like me to walk you through it?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I haven't checked the wiki yet. But I was wondering, who contributed to that resource on resolving forking, network, and old wallet issues in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe resource on resolving forking, network, and old wallet issues in Verus was contributed by Oink.vrsc@ and Thoskk.vrsc@.
