    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been noticing some weird warnings from my antivirus software when I try to run Verus. Why might antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky might flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it includes mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these warnings. Don't worry, Verus is safe to use!\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about an update that fixes an issue with nodes being banned too aggressively. What's the significance of this update, and why is it considered mandatory?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe update is significant because it fixes an issue that would ban nodes too aggressively, resulting in disconnection from the chain and potential to fork away from the main chain. This update is considered mandatory because it ensures that nodes remain connected to the main chain and prevents potential forks. It's essential to keep your Verus software up to date to avoid any issues.\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand more about VerusIDs. Can you explain what they are and how they differ from other blockchain ID implementations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to explain! VerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. VerusIDs provide opportunities for identity applications and offer features such as quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses, revocability, recoverability, and privacy. They're a unique and powerful solution for identity management on the blockchain. Would you like to know more about VerusIDs or is there something else I can help you with?",
