    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm thinking of using Verus, but I have some concerns. What kind of warranty or liability does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Additionally, the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. It's always a good idea to review the terms and conditions before using any software.\n\n**User:**\nI've noticed that some antivirus software detects Verus as a potential threat or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag Verus as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software. These warnings are intended to alert users that they are installing software that could potentially be used by a third party to exploit their PC for mining purposes. Don't worry, Verus is a legitimate software and these warnings are just a precautionary measure.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Where can I find more information about false positives and warnings from antivirus software related to Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about false positives and warnings from antivirus software related to Verus by reviewing the resources provided, such as the Malwarebytes blog post on PUP.Optional.BitcoinMiner and the Kaspersky blog post on \"Not-a-virus\". These resources can give you a better understanding of why some antivirus software may flag Verus and how to proceed. Do you have any more questions about Verus or its usage?",
