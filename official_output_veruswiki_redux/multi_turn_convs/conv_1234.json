    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in digging deeper into the technical side of Verus. Where can I find the source code for the VerusCoin wallet, miner, and explorer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find the VerusCoin source code on the VerusCoin GitHub page, which is located at https://github.com/veruscoin. You can explore the codebase and even contribute to the development of Verus if you're interested!\n\n**User:**\nThat's awesome, thank you! Now, how can I explore the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are multiple block explorers that allow you to explore the Verus blockchain. You can check out https://explorer.verus.io/, https://explorer.vrsc.0x03.services/, and https://dex.explorer.dexstats.info/. These explorers provide a user-friendly interface to browse the blockchain, view transactions, and more.\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the mining process on Verus. What is the mining algorithm used by Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus uses a mining algorithm called VerusHash 2.1, which is a Proof of Power (PoW/PoS) algorithm that is resistant to 51% attacks. It's designed to be CPU-targeted and non-discriminatory, equalizing the performance of CPU and FPGA mining.\n\n**User:**\nHow often are new blocks added to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNew blocks are added to the Verus blockchain every 1 minute. This fast block time allows for quick transaction processing and confirmation.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about VerusIDs, but what's unique about them in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. They provide opportunities for identity applications and are not controlled by a corporation. This means that VerusIDs offer a decentralized, community-driven approach to identity management, which is quite innovative!",
