    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in learning more about Verus. Specifically, what are some key features of Verus version v0.7.1-5, specifically related to TestNet protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus version v0.7.1-5 has several key features, including: \n\n1. Increased scale over previous versions\n2. Ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency\n3. Price neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies\n\nThese features are especially important for TestNet protocols, as they enable more robust and flexible testing of Verus capabilities. Do you have any further questions about these features or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I was looking at the API documentation and noticed a \"burn\" parameter in the \"sendcurrency\" API. What's the purpose of that, and how does it affect the currency's supply?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"burn\" parameter in the \"sendcurrency\" API allows a currency to be officially removed from the supply when sent. If \"burn\" is set to 1, the currency sent (which must be a token or fractional currency) is removed from the supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will increase the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned. This feature can be useful for managing currency supplies and adjusting tokenomics.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the \"burn\" parameter or the \"sendcurrency\" API?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question, actually. How does Verus prevent front running, and what benefits does this have for users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus prevents front running by ensuring that all transactions in an aggregation of import blocks are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions, and all converted at the same rate. This means that there is no spread between the conversion to and from a currency, and all users get the same price in each direction. This prevents front running and ensures a fair and transparent conversion process for all users.\n\nThis has several benefits for users, including ensuring that they get the best possible price for their conversions, and preventing malicious actors from exploiting price differences. It also adds to the overall trust and security of the Verus ecosystem. Does that answer your question?",
