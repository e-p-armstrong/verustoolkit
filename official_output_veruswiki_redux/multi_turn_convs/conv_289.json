    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been looking into Verus, and I was wondering, what kind of warranty or guarantee does Verus provide for its software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGreat question! Verus provides no warranty or guarantee for its software. The software is provided \"as is\", without any express or implied warranty, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. So, it's essential to use Verus at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. What kind of liability does Verus take for its software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood follow-up question! Verus does not take any liability for its software. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've been using Verus, and my antivirus software keeps flagging it as a potential threat or \"not-a-virus.\" Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a common issue! Verus is a mining software, and some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag it as a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it can be used by third parties to exploit your PC for mining purposes. This is a false positive, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these warnings. It's just a precautionary measure on the part of your antivirus software, but Verus itself is not malicious.",
