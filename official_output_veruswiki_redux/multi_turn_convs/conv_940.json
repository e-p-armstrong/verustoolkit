    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been following the development of Verus and I'm curious about the VerusHash algorithm. What was the goal of the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm, and how did it impact the performance of FPGAs and CPUs on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe goal of the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was to equalize the performance of FPGAs and modern CPUs on the Verus network. It was designed to prevent FPGAs from dominating CPUs in terms of performance, and it succeeded in keeping FPGA performance at a price ratio of under 2x that of CPUs. Did you have any experience with mining or staking on the Verus network before VerusHash 2.0?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also heard about VerusHash 2.1. What does it introduce, and how does it affect the balance between FPGAs and CPUs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which is expected to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still allowing FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. This should make it even more accessible for people to participate in the Verus network without needing specialized hardware.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that the Verus developers reached out to FPGA manufacturers. Why did they do that, and what was made available to them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus developers proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new VerusHash 2.1 algorithm available to them, so that everyone would have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy begins to roll out and identity rewards start streaming from the network. This way, FPGA manufacturers can prepare and adapt their products to work with the new algorithm, ensuring a smooth transition for all participants.",
