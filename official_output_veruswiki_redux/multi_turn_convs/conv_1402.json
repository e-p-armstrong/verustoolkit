    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about some of the tech behind Verus, and I was wondering if you could explain some of it to me. Specifically, what's the main goal of integrating zk-SNARKs into the Verus protocol, and what benefits does it provide to users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe integration of zk-SNARKs into the Verus protocol aims to improve blockchain address security. This technology provides several benefits to users, including the ability to recover their money after losing their keys, protection against identity and key theft, the ability to prove things about themselves without revealing unnecessary information, and the ability to transfer assets to heirs as part of their estate. zk-SNARKs are a powerful tool for protecting user privacy and security, and Verus is committed to making them a core part of our protocol.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been looking into Verus Smart Transactions. Can you tell me a bit about those? How do they differ from Komodo compatible crypto-conditions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Smart Transactions are a new technology introduced in this release, which replaces the use of Komodo compatible crypto-conditions. They are unique to the Verus network and will be available for use on other blockchains in the upcoming PBaaS network upgrade. Verus Smart Transactions use standard Bitcoin style serialization, making support on lite or mobile wallets simpler to implement compared to the crypto-condition protocol. This means that users will have a more seamless experience when using Verus Smart Transactions, and developers will have an easier time integrating them into their apps.\n\n**User:**\nI've also seen mentions of VerusHash 2.1. What's the purpose of that, and how does it improve upon VerusHash 2.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 is an adjustment to the equalization technology introduced in VerusHash 2.0. The goal of VerusHash 2.0 was to equalize the performance of FPGAs and modern CPUs, which it successfully achieved. VerusHash 2.1 aims to further improve this equalization, tilting the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still allowing FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. This means that users with CPUs will have a more competitive advantage when it comes to mining and verifying transactions, while FPGAs will still be able to participate in the network.",
