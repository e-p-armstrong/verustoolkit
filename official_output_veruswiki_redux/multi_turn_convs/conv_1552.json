    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm interested in trying out the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge. How can I access it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge at https://ethtest.verus.services using your MetaMask wallet. From there, you can convert or send cross-chain transactions through the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli testnet. Do you have any questions about how to use the bridge or what you need to get started?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yeah. What do I need to use the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo use the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge, you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus. Once you have that, you can start using the bridge. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nI think I may have messed up my Verus testnet. How can I reset it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo problem! To reset your Verus testnet, make sure Verus is closed and no testnet daemon is running. Then, delete the following directories: \n- On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`\n- On Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`\n- On Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`\nAfter deleting the directories, restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native). That should reset your testnet. Do you have any other questions about Verus or its testnet?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent using Verus. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent using the `registernamecommitment` command, which now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. You can use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank. For example, you can specify a parent currency, such as vrsc-btc, but no referrer. You can also use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration. Does that help?",
