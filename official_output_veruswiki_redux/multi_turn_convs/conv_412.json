    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to download the Verus software, but my antivirus keeps flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a common issue! Avast and Kaspersky might flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it involves mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, this is a false positive, and you can verify the authenticity of the download by following the instructions provided.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But how can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can also use the CLI examples provided to verify the file directly or using a checksum.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I saw some commands in the Verus documentation, `verifyfile` and `verifyhash`. What are they for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in Verus are used to verify the authenticity of a downloaded file by checking its signature against the signer's identity. The `verifyfile` command takes the signer's identity, the signature, and the file path as input, while the `verifyhash` command takes the signer's identity, the signature, and the checksum as input. If the signature is valid, the command will return `true`. This is just another way to ensure that the file you've downloaded is genuine and hasn't been tampered with.",
