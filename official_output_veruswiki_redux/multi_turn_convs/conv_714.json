    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to send money using the command line. Is there a way to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, once you have created your own identity, you can send money to a friendly name using commands like:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nor\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100\n```\nThese commands allow you to send money to a friendly name, making it easier to use the Verus identity technology. Do you have any questions about Verus IDs or the process of creating one?\n\n**User:**\nActually, that's exactly what I was going to ask about next. What are the two steps required to make a Verus ID, and why are they necessary?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo make a Verus ID, you need to complete two steps: committing to a name and registering the name. These steps are designed to prevent \"name front running\" by miners, where they could replace your purchase of an ID with their own purchase of the same name. The commitment step registers your interest in a name without revealing it, and the registration step reveals the name and requires a payment of 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST with a referral). Would you like more information about the commitment step and how it prevents \"name front running\"?\n\n**User:**\nExactly! I'm not entirely sure how committing to a name before registering it prevents \"name front running.\" Can you explain that a bit more?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCommitting to a name before registering it allows you to register your interest in a name without revealing it to others. This prevents \"name front running\" by miners, who could otherwise replace your purchase of an ID with their own purchase of the same name. By committing to a name first, you ensure that you have a chance to register the name before anyone else can. It's like reserving a spot in line to make sure you get the name you want.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How much does it cost to register a Verus ID, and can this cost be reduced with a referral?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe cost to register a Verus ID is 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST. However, if you have a referral from someone who already has an identity, the cost is reduced to 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. The funds for a referral are distributed according to the referral rules.",
