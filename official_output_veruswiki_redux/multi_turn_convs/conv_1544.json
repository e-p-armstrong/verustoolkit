    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about using VerusIDs. How can I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on Verus, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency` and `verus z_getoperationstatus`.\n2. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n3. Use `verus signrawtransaction` to sign the raw transaction with each additional wallet.\n4. After all necessary signatures are applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.\n\nThat should do it! Do you have any more questions about using VerusIDs or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I've been hearing about a new Verus testnet. What features does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers:\n\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Easy creation of new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange\n* Accessible from Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets\n\nIt's really exciting to see all these features come together in one platform! Do you have any other questions about the testnet or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds pretty impressive. What benefits does the Verus platform offer compared to other cryptocurrency platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers many benefits compared to other cryptocurrency platforms, including:\n\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange\n* Easy creation of new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* A full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform\n\nThese benefits allow for more flexibility, scalability, and ease of use compared to other cryptocurrency platforms. Verus is really pushing the boundaries of what's possible with blockchain technology! Do you have any more questions about Verus or its benefits?",
