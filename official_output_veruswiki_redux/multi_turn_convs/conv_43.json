    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to figure out the `decodescript` command in Verus. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `decodescript` command in Verus is used to decode a script that has been encoded in hexadecimal (hex) format. It's a useful tool for working with scripts in Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. How do I actually use the `decodescript` command to decode a hex-encoded script?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo decode a hex-encoded script in Verus, you can use the `decodescript` command followed by the hex-encoded script, like this: `decodescript \"hex\"`. This will decode the script and display the result. Make sure to replace `\"hex\"` with the actual hex-encoded script you want to decode.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! What kind of input does the `decodescript` command expect, anyway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `decodescript` command expects a hex-encoded script as input. You can provide the hex-encoded script as a string, and the command will take care of decoding it for you.",
