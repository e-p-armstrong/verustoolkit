    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to create a new currency using Verus, and I was wondering what it means to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining the currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Do you have any plans for your new currency, or would you like some guidance on how to get started?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! Actually, I do have a question about minting coins. How can I mint new coins for my currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can mint new coins for your currency using the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command mints 10,000 new coins for the \"mycoin\" currency and sends them to the address \"mike@\". Would you like more information on how to use the `sendcurrency` command or minting coins in general?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I think I'm almost ready to launch my testnet. What do I need to do before launching the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBefore launching the Verus testnet, you need to delete the following directories:\n* `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST`\n* `~/.verustest`\n\nThis is to ensure a clean start and prevent any potential issues with the testnet. It's always a good idea to start fresh when launching a new testnet. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
