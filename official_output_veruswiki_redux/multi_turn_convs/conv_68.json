    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with VerusIDs and I was wondering about the special abilities of `*.veth@` IDs. Can you tell me about those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n`*.veth@` IDs have some unique abilities. They can create 1:1 ERC20 mapped currencies on Ethereum, as well as create Tokenized ID control tokens. This is in addition to the abilities of root `vrsctest` IDs. Do you have any other questions about VerusIDs or `*.veth@` IDs specifically?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I've been looking at currency definitions on Verus and I saw the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN` flags. What's the purpose of those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN` flags in a currency definition on Verus are used to create a Tokenized ID control token, which is a next-generation NFT. This type of token has a max supply of 1 satoshi and can be either pre-allocated or pre-converted to. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about Tokenized ID control tokens or currency definitions?\n\n**User:**\nThat does make sense, thanks! I was wondering, how do I create a Tokenized ID control token on Verus using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a Tokenized ID control token on Verus using the command line, you can use the `definecurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```\n\nJust replace the `ControlTokenRecipient@` with the recipient's VerusID. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that helps a lot. One more thing, how do I reset my testnet on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your testnet on Verus, you need to:\n\n1. Close Verus and ensure no testnet daemon is running.\n2. Delete the following directories:\n\t* On Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`.\n\t* On Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`.\n\t* On Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`.\n3. Restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native).\n\nThat should do it! Do you have any other questions about resetting your testnet or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing, how do I create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent on Verus using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent on Verus using the `registernamecommitment` command, which now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank. For example:\n\n```\nregisternamecommitment <arguments> \"vrsc-btc\" \"\"\n```\n\nThis command specifies a parent currency, `vrsc-btc`, but no referrer. You can also use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about creating identities with fractional currencies as parents?",
