    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about setting up blockchains on the Verus network. What types of blockchains can be set up on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn the Verus network, both public and private, internal blockchains can be set up. Private blockchains are easy to set up and allow for easy bridging of public currencies into an organization's internal network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. Is that what you were looking for?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. Are there any limits to the number of blockchains that can operate on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, there is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. The Verus blockchain network model is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. Do you have any other questions about setting up blockchains on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about locking IDs on the Verus network. How can I lock an ID on the Verus network, and what are the different types of locks available?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn the Verus network, IDs can be locked using the `updateidentity` command. There are two types of locks available: Time Lock and Time Delay. \n\nA Time Lock sets the unlock height of the identity, which means the ID will be locked until a certain block height is reached. \n\nA Time Delay sets a delay for an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state, meaning the ID will be locked for a certain number of blocks after being unlocked. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a locked identity if it is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a locked identity is revoked, its locked status will be cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height. So, revocation will override any locks that are in place.\n\n**User:**\nCan a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. Revocation requires the authority to revoke, which is not possible when the ID is locked.\n\n**User:**\nI also have a question about the `getcurrencyconverters` API. What does it do on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. This API is useful for getting information about currencies that can be converted on the Verus network.",
