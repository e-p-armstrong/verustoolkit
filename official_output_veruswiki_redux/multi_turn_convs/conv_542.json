    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm curious about the current state of Verus. Can you tell me about the status of the Verus network, PBaaS, VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols are considered feature complete. The core developers have focused on building a robust and scalable protocol, and they've reached a major milestone in completing the features.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! So, what's next for the core developers now that the protocol features are complete?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNow that the features are complete, the core developers are shifting their focus to protocol hardening, enabling usage, and then user experience upgrades. They're also working on supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets, and merge mining for pool servers. This will help make Verus more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about a new feature in Verus Desktop. Can you tell me about the 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer in Verus Desktop is a really cool feature. It shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on-chain and cross-chain, allowing you to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions. To access the visualizer, simply click on \u201cVisualize Network\u201d on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop. It's a great way to visualize the connections between different chains and currencies.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the testnet? Are there any new PBaaS capabilities available, and what's the goal for interoperability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll PBaaS capabilities, including those for application development, are available on the new Verus testnet. The goal for interoperability is to launch bridges between different chains, such as the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge, allowing for seamless interactions between them. This will enable developers to build applications that can interact with multiple chains, making it easier to build complex decentralized applications.",

The core developer focus now is protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets as well as merge mining for pool servers.## NEW 3D CROSS-CHAIN LIQUIDITY NETWORK VISUALIZER (GUI FOR TESTNET)\nIn v0.9.2 Verus Desktop, there is a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on chain and cross-chain, with the ability to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions. To access the visualizer, click on \u201cVisualize Network\u201d on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop.

Our goal for interoperability on this new testnet is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge in the next couple days. Now would be a good time for development capable projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus\u2019s transformative technologies to do a deep dive on the Verus testnet. These new capabilities in v0.9.2, as well as all those we are familiar with, available nowhere else, will be on mainnet SOON(\u2122):",
