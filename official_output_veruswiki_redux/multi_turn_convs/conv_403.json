    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to lock an ID using Verus, can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock an ID using the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter. This sets the unlock height of the identity. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nDo you have any further questions about locking an ID or would you like more information about the `timelock` parameter?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. What's the difference between Time Lock and Time Delay in Verus ID locking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTime Lock sets the unlock height of the identity, while Time Delay sets how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. So, Time Lock is more like a specific point in time when the ID will be unlocked, while Time Delay is more like a waiting period before the ID can be unlocked again. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What happens to a locked identity if it is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a locked identity is revoked, its locked status will be cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height. So, revoking a locked identity essentially resets its lock status.\n\n**User:**\nAnd can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. You'll need to use a different identity or mechanism to revoke a locked identity.\n\n**User:**\nMoving on to a different topic, what does the `getcurrencyconverters` API do in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example, `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold. Does that help?",
