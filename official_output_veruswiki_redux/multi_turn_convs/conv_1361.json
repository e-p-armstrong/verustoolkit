    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in the DeFi protocol on Verus. How does it address the issues of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol addresses the issues of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This mechanism provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know. I'm also curious about the relationship between launching a new blockchain and launching a bridge converter liquidity pool on Verus.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, a new blockchain and its corresponding bridge converter liquidity pool are launched simultaneously. The bridge converter liquidity pool is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How does Verus ensure that a blockchain or bridge launch is successful in terms of participation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus allows users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. This mechanism ensures that launches are successful and that participants are protected in case of insufficient participation.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What kind of customization options are available for launching a blockchain or bridge on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers several features for customizing the launch of a blockchain or bridge. You can set maximum participation in one or more currencies, offer pre-launch discounts, and make price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies. There is also an option for a price-neutral carve-out. This allows you to tailor the launch to your specific needs and goals.",
