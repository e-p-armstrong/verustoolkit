    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in the security features of Verus. Can you tell me about Verus Vault? How does it protect my funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows you to lock your VerusID, preventing anyone from spending funds associated with that identity until it is unlocked. While locked, you can still receive funds and stake your VerusID to earn rewards on the Verus network. This provides an additional layer of security and protection against theft, even if your private key is compromised. Would you like to know more about how to enable Verus Vault?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really useful. What are the requirements to enable Verus Vault capabilities, such as revocation, recovery, and locking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable Verus Vault capabilities, you need to have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation and recovery ID configured. This allows you to set up a secure system for managing your VerusID and protecting your funds. Do you have any questions about configuring these identities?\n\n**User:**\nGot it. Can a locked VerusID be revoked and recovered, and how does this work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, a locked VerusID can be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which can circumvent the lock. This allows for decentralized recovery of funds in case of unauthorized access or theft. This way, you can rest assured that even if your ID is compromised, you can still recover your funds.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" - how does Verus Vault protect against that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault provides protection against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" by allowing you to set a predetermined unlock time, such as a 24-hour delay, for your locked IDs. This means that even if someone gains access to your primary keys, they cannot spend or access your funds until the unlock time has passed, giving you or a designated revocation ID holder time to detect and prevent unauthorized access.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really clever. What other use cases does Verus Vault support beyond fund protection?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault also provides security and time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance, as well as protection for your IDs and NFTs. It's a very versatile feature that can be used in a variety of scenarios where secure and timelocked management of digital assets is necessary.",

This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs.
