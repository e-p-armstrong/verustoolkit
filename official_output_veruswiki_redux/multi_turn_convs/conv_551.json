    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to download the Verus software, but my antivirus software keeps flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question! Antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky may flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it includes mining software, which can be used to exploit a user's PC if installed by a third party without their knowledge or consent. This doesn't mean that Verus software is malicious, but rather that it has the potential to be used for malicious purposes if not installed and used correctly.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But how can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download to ensure it is genuine and not tampered with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can follow these steps: first, extract the downloaded archive. Then, verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. Finally, extract the archive to the desired directory. You can also use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the signature and checksum of the download. This ensures that the download is genuine and hasn't been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that there's a new `convertpassphrase` API in Verus CLI v0.6.4-1. What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `convertpassphrase` API allows for the export of WIF (Wallet Import Format) keys from Electrum wallet passphrases. This makes it easier to transition from Electrum to Verus.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about digital signatures in Verus. What's the significance of them, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer a worldwide, verifiable, decentralized, and single or multi-sig friendly-name signature system for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations. They provide full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft. This means that you can use Verus digital signatures to prove ownership or authenticity of digital assets, while still maintaining control over your identity and data. Does that make sense?",
