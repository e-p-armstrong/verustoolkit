    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to set up my full node wallet and I was wondering, what's the purpose of setting a cheat catcher address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of setting a cheat catcher address in a full node wallet is to enable it to detect and report cheating behavior on the network. Specifically, it looks for instances where the same winning coins are posted on two different forks, signed by the same person. If such cheating is detected, the wallet will create a transaction with cryptographic evidence of the cheating and submit it to the cheat catcher's address. It's an important feature to help maintain the integrity of the network.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been wondering, how do cheat catching rewards work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCheat catching rewards do not create new coins, but rather take them away from cheaters. They are earned by miners and stakers who detect and report cheating behavior on the network. The rewards are available equally across the network to all miners and stakers, and are dependent on who happens to observe the cheating fork and catches the cheater, rather than on staking or mining power. It's a way to incentivize good behavior and keep the network honest.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the explanation! I've been having some issues with my wallet balance getting out of sync with the blockchain while staking. Do you know what I can do to fix the problem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a common issue! If your wallet balance gets out of sync with the blockchain while staking, you can rescan to fix the problem. That should get your wallet back in sync with the blockchain. If you're still having trouble, feel free to ask and I can try to help you troubleshoot further!",
