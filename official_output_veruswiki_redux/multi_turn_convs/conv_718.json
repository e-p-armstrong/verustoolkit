    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm learning about the Verus network and I have a few questions. What types of blockchains can be set up on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn the Verus network, both public and private, internal blockchains can be set up. These private blockchains are easy to set up and allow for easy bridging of public currencies into an organization's internal network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain, but without the public access.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. Are there any limitations on the number of blockchains that can operate on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, there is no limit on the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. The Verus blockchain network follows a fractal model, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains, with some overhead for cross-notarization.\n\n**User:**\nI'm learning about IDs on the Verus network. How can I lock an ID on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock an ID on the Verus network using the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter. This sets the unlock height of the identity. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nAdditionally, you can set a time delay for unlocking an ID by setting the `flags` to 2.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens when an ID is revoked on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an ID is revoked on the Verus network, its locked status is cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height. However, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the APIs on the Verus network. What is the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` API on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. This allows you to query for currencies that have specific market liquidity thresholds. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis command returns all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
