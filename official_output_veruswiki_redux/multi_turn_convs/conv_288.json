    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really curious about VerusIDs. What's the difference between Native IDs and IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies in terms of launching currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNative IDs, which are registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, can launch currencies on that blockchain, and if on Verus, actual independent blockchains. On the other hand, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, but they will still be valuable for other use cases such as revocation and recovery IDs, personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses, proofs, brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. Are there any exceptions to non-native IDs creating currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is an exception. The *.veth gateway IDs, which will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter, will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies.\n\n**User:**\nHow much does it cost to register a.veth ID, and where do the fees go?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRegistration of.veth IDs costs 100 USD worth of ETH to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity. All fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool, go to the bridge converter liquidity basket.\n\n**User:**\nI'm experimenting with the testnet. How can I reset my testnet on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your testnet, make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon is running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native).\n\n**User:**\nWhere can I stay connected to learn more about the development of Verus and participate in the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can stay connected on the #pbaas-development channel to learn more about the development of Verus and participate in the testnet at no actual cost as a testnet liquidity provider.",
