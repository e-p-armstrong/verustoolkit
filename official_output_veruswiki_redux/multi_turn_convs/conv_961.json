    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been using VRSCTEST for a while now, but I haven't updated it in a while. What should I do if I have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the latest release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you've been using an older version of VRSCTEST, it's essential to take a few steps before running the new update. You need to delete specific directories depending on your operating system. For Linux, delete `~/.komodo/vrsctest`; for MacOS, delete `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`; and for Windows, delete `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`. This will ensure a smooth transition to the latest version. Have you updated VRSCTEST successfully?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I have another question, somewhat related to the usage of Verus software. What kind of warranty or liability does Verus provide for its software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nImportant question! Verus provides no warranty or liability for its software. The software is provided \"as is\", without any kind of warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. So, it's essential to use the software at your own risk. Do you have any more questions about Verus or its software?",
