    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm a bit new to Verus, and I'm trying to figure out some of the commands. Can you tell me what the purpose of the `move` command is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `move` command is used to move a specified amount of VRSC from one account in your wallet to another. Note that it's now deprecated, but it can still be used. If you're looking for alternative ways to manage your funds, I'd be happy to help with that as well!\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! Another command I'm not sure about is `prunespentwallettransactions`. What's that used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `prunespentwallettransactions` command is used to remove all spent transactions from your wallet. You can also specify a transaction ID to keep, and all other transactions will be removed. Just a heads up: it's recommended to backup your wallet.dat file before running this command, just in case.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What kind of information does the `prunespentwallettransactions` command return?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you run `prunespentwallettransactions`, it returns a JSON object with three properties: `total_transactions`, `remaining_transactions`, and `removed_transactions`. These properties indicate the total number of transactions in the wallet, the number of transactions remaining after cleaning, and the number of transactions removed, respectively. This should give you a good idea of what's been cleaned up in your wallet!",
