    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to set up a new currency in Verus and I'm not sure about the `proofprotocol` setting. What does it mean to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new currency, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that helps. So, how can I mint new coins for a currency that has its `proofprotocol` set to PROOF_CHAINID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins for a currency with `proofprotocol` set to PROOF_CHAINID, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. For example, if you want to mint 10,000 new coins of \"mycoin\" to the address \"mike@\", you can use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nJust replace the values with your own currency and address. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What are the implications of setting `proofprotocol` to PROOF_CHAINID for a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSetting `proofprotocol` to PROOF_CHAINID for a currency means that the controller of the chain ID has the ability to mint new coins. This allows for more control over the currency supply and can be useful in certain use cases, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or tokenized assets. However, it also means that the controller of the chain ID has significant power over the currency, which can be a centralizing factor. So, it's essential to consider the implications of this setting carefully before making a decision.",
