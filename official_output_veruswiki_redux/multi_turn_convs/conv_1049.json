    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand more about the `currencyconverters` API in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `currencyconverters` API in Verus is used to retrieve a list of currencies that meet specific liquidity and reserve ratio requirements. It helps you find currencies that are liquid and have a strong reserve backing, which is essential for various use cases in Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What are the specific requirements for a currency to be included in the list returned by the `currencyconverters` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo be included in the list, a currency must have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve and a reserve ratio greater than 10%. Additionally, the currency must have all listed currencies as reserves. These requirements ensure that the currencies in the list are stable and have sufficient liquidity.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. How can I use the `currencyconverters` API to retrieve a list of currencies that have a specific market, such as BTC/ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` command to retrieve a list of currencies that have a specific market, such as BTC/ETH. The command format is:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return a list of currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold. You can replace `btc` and `eth` with any other currencies you're interested in.",
