    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been having some trouble signing a transaction from a multi-signature ID on the Verus testnet. Can you walk me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction using `verus sendcurrency` and get the raw transaction data.\n2. Use `verus z_getoperationstatus` to get the operation ID and raw hex transaction data.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n4. Use `verus signrawtransaction` to sign the raw hex transaction data in each wallet.\n5. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.\n\nDoes that help? Have you tried these steps before, or would you like more clarification?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I've been meaning to ask about the new Verus testnet. What are some key features of it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers many features, including:\n\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Ability to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange\n\nIt's really exciting stuff! Have you had a chance to explore the testnet yet?\n\n**User:**\nNot yet, but I'd love to! How can I access the new Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets. You can use these wallets to explore the features and capabilities of the testnet. Just make sure you're using the latest version of the wallet, and you'll be all set!",
