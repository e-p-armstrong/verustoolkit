    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got some questions about the Verus software itself. What kind of warranty or liability does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This includes but is not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. In other words, you use the software at your own risk, and we can't be held responsible for any issues that may arise.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What kind of permissions are granted to users of the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsers of the Verus software are granted permission to deal in the software without restriction, including the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software. This means you have a lot of freedom to use the software as you see fit, as long as you're not causing any harm or violating any laws.\n\n**User:**\nI've had an issue where my antivirus software flagged the Verus software as a virus or \"not-a-virus\". What should I do in this case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf your antivirus software flags the Verus software as a virus or \"not-a-virus\", it may be a false positive. This is because the software is a cryptocurrency miner, and some antivirus software may flag it as a potential threat. You can review the resources provided to learn more about these false positives and understand that they are warnings about installing mining software, not actual viruses. Don't worry, the software is safe to use!\n\n**User:**\nWhere can I find more information about the Verus software and its safety?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about the Verus software and its safety by reviewing the provided resources, such as the VirusTotal links for MacOS, Linux-AMD64, and Windows. These links provide detection information about the software. Additionally, you can review the blog posts from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky about PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program) warnings and \"not-a-virus\" flags. We've got plenty of information available to help you feel confident in using our software.",
