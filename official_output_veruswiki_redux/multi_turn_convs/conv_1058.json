    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand a script that uses the `find` command. Can you help me out? What is the purpose of the `find` command in the given script?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of the `find` command is to search for files in the specified `$DEST_FOLDER` directory that match the criteria specified, and then execute a command on those files. It's a powerful command that can be used to search and manipulate files based on various criteria such as name, size, modification time, and more.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, what happens to the files that match the criteria specified by the `find` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn this case, the files that match the criteria specified by the `find` command are deleted using the `rm` command. This is specified by the `-exec rm {}` option. So, be careful when using `find` with the `-exec` option, as it can permanently delete files!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Why is it so important to fully understand how the `find` command works before running it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt is important to fully understand how the `find` command works before running it because it can permanently delete files that match the specified criteria. If the command is not used correctly, it can lead to unintended file deletions, which can result in data loss. So, it's crucial to test the command with the `-print` option instead of `-exec` to see what files would be affected, and then verify the results before running the actual command.",
