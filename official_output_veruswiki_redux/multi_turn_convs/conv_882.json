    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand the `sendcurrency` API in Verus. Can you tell me what it's used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API is used to send and convert funds in Verus. It's a powerful tool for managing your digital assets. Do you have any specific questions about how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. I want to send some VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient. How can I do that using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to the address `alice@`. Just replace the addresses and amount with your own information.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. But what if I want to send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients? How can I do that using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients, `alice@:private` and `bob@:private`. Just add or remove recipients as needed, and adjust the amounts accordingly.",
