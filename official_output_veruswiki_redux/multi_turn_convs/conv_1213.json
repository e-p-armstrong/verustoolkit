    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've been wondering about identity rewards in Verus. Can you explain their purpose and how they affect the currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIdentity rewards in Verus are designed to incentivize and reward users for participating in the network and contributing to its growth. These rewards are structured in a way that they do not inflate the currency, meaning they do not add to the overall supply of tokens in circulation. Instead, they are meant to provide a steady stream of revenue to users, exceeding the potential earnings from traditional block rewards.\n\nSo, in essence, identity rewards are a way to encourage users to engage with the Verus network, help it grow, and contribute to its success, while also ensuring that the currency remains stable and healthy. Does that make sense?",
