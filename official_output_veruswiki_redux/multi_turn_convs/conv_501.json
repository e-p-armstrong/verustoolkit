    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about how Verus enables new blockchain creation. Can you tell me about the concept of simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches refer to the ability to launch a new blockchain and a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool at the same time. The bridge converter currencies are flexible and can be 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed, and all fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This allows for a seamless and efficient way to launch new blockchains with built-in liquidity and interoperability.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard about crowdfunding currency launches in Verus. Can you explain how those work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches allow you to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimum levels are not met by the start time of your blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, minus network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations, and vesting schedules. This allows for a community-driven and fair way to launch new currencies and blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nI've also come across the term Notary IDs in Verus. What's the purpose of those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus multichain network, Notary IDs are specified at chain definition and provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be available to the world for merge mining and staking, allowing for unlimited scale and new use cases. Notary IDs play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and security of the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, what's the overall capability of the Verus multichain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multichain network is capable of creating an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, allowing for unlimited scale and new use cases. The network enables the creation of multiple blockchains that can interact with each other seamlessly, providing a highly scalable and flexible infrastructure for blockchain-based applications. This allows for a wide range of possibilities, from creating new currencies to building complex decentralized applications.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about Verus or its capabilities!",
