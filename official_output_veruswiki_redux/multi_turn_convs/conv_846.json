    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with creating my own currencies in Verus, and I'm a bit unclear on some of the settings. What does it mean to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new currency in Verus, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about creating currencies in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! Actually, yes, I do. How can I mint new coins of a currency I created in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can mint new coins of a currency you created in Verus by using the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command will mint 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and send them to the address \"mike@\". Have you tried using the `sendcurrency` command before?",
