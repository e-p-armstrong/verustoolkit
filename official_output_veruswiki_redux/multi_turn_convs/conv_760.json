    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I need some help with using the command line to get some currency statistics. How can I get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block by running the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate\n```\n\nJust copy and paste that into your terminal, and you should get the information you need. Do you have any other questions about using the command line?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! But what if I want to get currency statistics for a specific block? How would I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get currency statistics for a specific block by running the following command, replacing `blocknum` with the desired block number:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\n\nJust replace `blocknum` with the actual block number you're interested in, and you'll get the statistics for that block. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I want to get currency statistics for a range of blocks with a specific period between them? Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, that's possible! You can get currency statistics for a range of blocks with a specific period between them by running the following command, replacing `startblocknum` with the starting block number, `endblocknum` with the ending block number, and `blockstostep` with the desired period:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```\n\nJust fill in the numbers, and you'll get the statistics for the range of blocks you specified. Do you have any other questions about using the command line?\n\n**User:**\nI have another question. What if I need to refund contributions made to a failed PBaaS chain launch? How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can refund contributions made to a failed PBaaS chain launch by running the following command, replacing `CHAINNAME` with the name of the failed chain:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME\n```\n\nJust replace `CHAINNAME` with the actual name of the failed chain, and the contributions will be refunded. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I have a question about the Verus software itself. What kind of warranty or liability does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.
