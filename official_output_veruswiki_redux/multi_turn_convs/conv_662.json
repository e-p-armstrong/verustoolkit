    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to learn more about the latest updates to the PBaaS protocol. Can you tell me what new capabilities are added in version 1.0.1?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVersion 1.0.1 of the PBaaS protocol introduces several new capabilities. These include the ability to mint currency on demand by the identity of the currency as part of the `sendcurrency` command, the ability to burn a liquidity basket currency to affect the reserve ratio weights of the currency, registering identities on a currency where the fee for registration is sent directly to the identity of the currency, the ability to set an \"endblock\" for a centralized currency, and the ability to register identities on a decentralized non-liquidity token. Do you have any specific questions about these new capabilities?\n\n**User:**\nThat's a lot of new features. Can you explain how burning a liquidity basket currency works in version 1.0.1?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn version 1.0.1, burning a liquidity basket currency doesn't affect the supply/reserve ratio as normal burns do. Instead, the identity of a centralized currency can burn currency to affect the reserve ratio weights of the currency. This allows for more control over the currency's reserve ratio.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to the fee for registering an identity on a decentralized currency in version 1.0.1?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an identity is registered on a decentralized currency, the fee for the registration is burned into the currency. On a liquidity basket, this puts the fee into the liquidity pool for all LPs to share in earnings, and for a standard token, it reduces the supply and available future registrations on that currency.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about setting an \"endblock\" on a centralized currency. What does that do in version 1.0.1?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an \"endblock\" is set on a centralized currency in version 1.0.1, all centralized capabilities of the same ID will end, and the currency will be converted to a decentralized currency with no special control over it after that occurs by any identity on the network. This means that the currency will no longer be controlled by a single entity, and will instead be decentralized and community-driven.",

Registering identities on a currency, where the fee for registration is sent directly to the identity of the currency.\n4.

            "### What\u2019s New\nIn addition to the full PBaaS protocol and all capabilities previously described, version 1.0.1 will also include some new capabilities that were previously not in the PBaaS protocol. The capabilities basically extend the idea of a centralized currency to include the ability to launch temporarily centralized currencies, including those that can issue identities. This is achieved by setting the \u201cendblock\u201d on a centralized currency launch of either a token or liquidity basket, enabling:\n 1) Minting of currency on demand by the identity of the currency as part of the `sendcurrency`command.\n 2) Burning a liquidity basket currency, but instead of affecting the supply/reserve ratio as normal burns do, the identity of a centralized currency can also burn currency to affect the reserve ratio weights of the currency.\n 3) Registering identities on a currency. When an identity is registered on a centralized currency, the fee for the registration is not burned into the currency, but sent directly to the identity of the currency. This is true for token or liquidity basket currencies. For decentralized currencies, fees are burned, which on a liquidity basket, puts them into the liquidity pool for all LPs to share in earnings, and for a standard token, reduces the supply and available future registrations on that currency.\n 4) In v1.0.1, setting the endblock of a centralized currency causes all centralized capabilities of the same ID to end, converting it in whatever state it currently is in a decentralized currency with no special control over it after that occurs by any identity on the network.\n 5) v1.0.0 did not allow a decentralized non-liquidity token to register identities. v1.0.1 does.",
