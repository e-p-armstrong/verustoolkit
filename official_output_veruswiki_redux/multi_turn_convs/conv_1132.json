    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to find some files related to Verus, but I'm not sure where they're located on my system. Can you help me out? Where are the standard locations for Verus files such as `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata, and `VRSC.conf` on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe standard locations for Verus files such as `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata, and `VRSC.conf` vary depending on the operating system.\n\nOn Linux, they are located at `~/.komodo/VRSC`.\n\nOn Mac OS, they are located at `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`.\n\nOn Windows 10, they are located at `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`.\n\nAlternatively, you can find the default Verus data folder by using the Verus Desktop application and clicking on `help` and then `Show Verus data folder (default)`.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",
