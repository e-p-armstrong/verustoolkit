    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to define a new currency in Verus, and I'm not sure what some of the settings mean. Can you help me out? Specifically, what does it mean to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency, like \"mycoin\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins of the defined currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. But how does the controller of the chain ID actually mint new coins of a currency, like \"mycoin\", in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe controller of the chain ID can mint new coins by using the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option set to 1. For example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n\nThis command would mint 10,000 new \"mycoin\" units and send them to the address \"mike@\". Does that make sense?",
