    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a few questions about VerusIDs. I've been using the `updateidentity` command, and I noticed something changed. What has changed with the `updateidentity` command regarding the case of characters in a VerusID's name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `updateidentity` command can now change the case of characters in the name of a VerusID in the global locale. That's a nice improvement, isn't it?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, it is. I also had a question about revocation. What happens to the revocation identity's control over an ID after revocation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter revocation, the revocation identity loses all control over the ID, including the ability to change the revocation identity itself. The recovery identity will have full control over the revoked ID.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I've also been hearing about VerusHash. What is VerusHash, and what is its version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash is a staking and hashing consensus protocol used in Verus. The version is 2.2. VerusHash is an important part of what makes Verus work, and it's constantly being improved.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I saw a disclaimer somewhere about the software license. What kind of software license is described in the disclaimer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software license described is an open-source license, which allows users to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software without restriction, as long as the copyright notice and permission notice are included. This license is what makes Verus open-source and community-driven.",
