    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in launching a new currency on Verus. How can I initiate a currency launch on Verus, and what are the requirements for a successful launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo initiate a currency launch on Verus, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. The launch will start 50 blocks after the transaction is made, and it requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD. This process is part of the mining process, and miners who participate in the launch will earn 0.025% conversion fees.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds straight-forward, but what happens if I send a conversion command before the GOLD token launches? How will my funds be affected?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you send a conversion command before the GOLD token launches, your conversion will be parked until the token launches. Once the token launches, you will either receive the converted amount of GOLD (in this case, 0.975 GOLD for every 100 VRSCTEST) or have your original VRSCTEST amount returned to your wallet. So, you don't have to worry about losing your funds if you send a conversion command too early.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Suppose I want to create a new token on Verus that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, assuming GOLD has already launched. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a new token on Verus that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST by defining the token's properties, such as its name, options, currencies, and proof protocol. You can then use the `definecurrency` command to create the token. The new token can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, allowing for flexibility and exchange between different currencies on the Verus network.",
