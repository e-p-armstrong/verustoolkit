    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about how Verus works, specifically with regards to fees and crowdfunding launches. Can you tell me about the relationship between fees generated on a new blockchain and the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool on a new blockchain are earned on that blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This means that the new blockchain retains full control over its fees, and there is no revenue sharing with the Verus blockchain. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about fees on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I'm also interested in crowdfunding currency launches on Verus. How do they work, and what happens if the minimum participation levels are not met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches allow you to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If the minimum participation levels are not met by the start time of your blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, minus network fees. This ensures that participants are protected in case the launch is not successful. Does that answer your question? Do you have any more about crowdfunding on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. Are there any features available for customizing a crowdfunding currency launch on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, Verus provides several features to customize a crowdfunding currency launch, including: setting maximum participation in one or more currencies, offering pre-launch discounts, making price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, providing price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and offering pre-launch discounts for early participants. Additionally, launches can include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations using VerusIDs. These features give you a lot of flexibility in structuring your crowdfunding launch. Do you have any more questions about customization options?\n\n**User:**\nI think I have a good understanding of crowdfunding on Verus now. Can you tell me more about the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a decentralized network that allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. This network enables the creation of public blockchains available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that are easy to set up and bridge with public currencies. The key benefits of this network include unlimited scale, easy setup and bridging of blockchains, and decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation through Notary IDs. Does that help you understand the Verus network better?",
