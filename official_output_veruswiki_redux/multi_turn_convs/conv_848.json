    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few more questions about Verus and how it works. What happens to fees generated on a new blockchain that was created using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn a new blockchain created using Verus, the fees generated are earned on that blockchain itself, without any rent going back to the Verus blockchain. The connection between the blockchains is seamless, allowing for the free flow of funds and liquidity. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really cool. What about crowdfunding currency launches on Verus? How do those work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, crowdfunding currency launches can be set up with minimum participation requirements. If the required minimum participation levels are not met by the launch time, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversion amounts, minus network fees. The launch options also allow for maximum participation, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations, and vesting schedules. It's a very flexible and customizable system.\n\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in the potential of Verus. What is the potential scale of the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, enabling unlimited scale and new use cases. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on the Verus network. The possibilities are truly endless!\n\n**User:**\nThat's amazing. One last question, how do notary IDs work in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that are easy to set up and bridge with public currencies. It's a key feature that enables the seamless interaction between different blockchains on the Verus network.",
