    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard that Verus has gotten some new features. What are some new capabilities that have been added to Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou're right! Verus has gotten some exciting new features. Some new capabilities that have been added to Verus include:\n\n* On-chain launches of token, centralized currency, and liquidity basket AMMs\n* On-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming\n* On-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles\n\nIt's really exciting to see how these new features are expanding the possibilities of what's possible on Verus! Do you have any questions about these new capabilities, or would you like to know more about something specific?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I'm curious about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. What is it, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on-chain. This allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, with the option to use transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses. Users can also choose to share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership.\n\nThe marketplace is a game-changer for digital ownership, and it's amazing to see how it's opening up new possibilities for creators, collectors, and users alike! Do you have any questions about how it works, or would you like to know more about the benefits it offers?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting! What benefits does the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace offer to users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace offers several benefits to users, including:\n\n* Decentralized transactions, with no intermediary necessary\n* Ability to execute transactions directly, peer-to-peer\n* Option to use transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses\n* Ability to share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership\n* The next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.\n\nIt's really empowering to have this level of control and flexibility in digital ownership, and I think it's going to open up a lot of new opportunities for creators and collectors! Do you have any more questions about the marketplace, or would you like to know more about Verus in general?",

            "Thanks to ejuliano#8606 for suggesting the initial idea that led to the realization that these features could be added quite easily and with very little protocol risk. All of these new capabilities have had full coverage testing and validation over the past week thanks to @Asherda\u2019s leadership on that front.Meanwhile, @alexenglish, @monkins1010, @asherda, quipacorn#5205, and others have been working on the Ethereum bridge deployment in preparation for this release. The testnet will transition to the v1.0.1 protocol with no reset required, Monday, May 8, 2023 4:00:00 PM, UTC.\n# Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see.

Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary.
