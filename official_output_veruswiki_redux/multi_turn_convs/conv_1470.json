    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm excited about the upcoming changes to the CHIPS blockchain. How will it change when PBaaS goes live on mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen PBaaS goes live on mainnet, the CHIPS blockchain will undergo a significant transformation. It will move to being an interoperable, merge mineable PBaaS chain with a 10-second block time. This change will open up new possibilities and use cases for the CHIPS blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What new features will be available for configuring PBaaS chains in future versions of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn future versions of Verus, you'll have even more flexibility when it comes to configuring PBaaS chains. Specifically, you'll be able to configure the block time and the PoW averaging window for any PBaaS chain's PoP consensus between 10 seconds and 2 minutes, in addition to its notarization frequency, as part of the chain definition. This will enable a greater variety of PBaaS use cases, transaction throughput, and application capabilities.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge. How can I test it out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge at https://ethtest.verus.services, using your MetaMask, and convert or send cross-chain through the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features, you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus. Give it a try and see how it works!",

            "This release also includes a new capability for testnet, which was pioneered by CHIPS developer @Biz, who worked to modify and test the Verus PoP algorithm to support 10 second block times, which the CHIPS chain uses to enable its game application focus. These new parameters will enable the CHIPS blockchain to move to being an interoperable, merge mineable PBaaS chain with a 10 second blocktime when PBaaS goes live on mainnet. To learn how to test the new CHIPS test chain on testnet, visit the #pbaas-development channel, as the support in v0.9.4-5 is not as complete as it will be in the next and hopefully final testnet reset. In that next version, blocktime and the pow averaging window for any PBaaS chain\u2019s PoP consensus will be able to be configured between 10 seconds and 2 minutes in addition to its notarization frequency as part of the chain definition, enabling a greater variety of PBaaS use cases, transaction throughput, and application capabilities.As a reminder, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services , using your metamask, converting or sending cross chain through the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli.
