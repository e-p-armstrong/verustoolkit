    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about the Verus testnet. Are the assets on the testnet valued, and can they be reset?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, all currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value, and they may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. Think of the testnet as a sandbox where you can experiment with new protocols and features without any real-world consequences.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I get a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies to try out the new protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies by visiting the Verus Discord and asking in the #pbaas-development channel. You can use the link https://discord.gg/gecZsCf as an invite to the Verus Discord. The community is always happy to help new users get started with testing the new features.\n\n**User:**\nCool, I'll check that out. Will the features currently available on the testnet be available on mainnet in the future?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the features currently available on the testnet will be available on mainnet in the near future, once they are considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. The testnet is where we iron out any kinks and make sure everything is working as intended before we roll it out to the mainnet. So, what you're seeing on the testnet today is a sneak peek of what's to come on the mainnet soon!",

            "## The Verus DeFi Testnet -- THERE IS NO TESTNET RESET\nAll new 'sendcurrency' features described above now work on both mainnet and testnet. In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well.This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever released, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it\u2019s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet.
