    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about Verus being used for token launches. Can you tell me more about how Verus facilitates token launches with features like carve-outs of proceeds, pre-launch discounts, and vesting schedules?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus allows token launches to include features like carve-outs of proceeds, pre-launch discounts for early participants, and vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs. This enables a high degree of customization and flexibility for token launches on the Verus platform.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. But what is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what are its key features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a platform that enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. It features decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation using Notary IDs, allowing for public blockchains to be merge mined and staked, as well as private, internal blockchains that can easily bridge public currencies into an organization's internal network. The Verus network has no limit on the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate simultaneously.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What is the purpose of the Notary IDs in the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be merge mined and staked, as well as private, internal blockchains to easily bridge public currencies into an organization's internal network. They play a crucial role in facilitating the interoperability of the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nHow do you lock and unlock IDs in Verus, and what are the differences between Time Lock and Time Delay?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, you can lock and unlock IDs using the `updateidentity` command. The `timelock` parameter defines the unlock height of the identity for Time Lock, or the number of blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state for Time Delay. A locked identity cannot revoke itself, and revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens when you revoke a locked identity in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you revoke a locked identity in Verus, it will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. This ensures that the identity can no longer be used for its original purpose, and its locked status is removed.",
