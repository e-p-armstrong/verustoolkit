    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about security. I've tried to download Verus, but Avast and Kaspersky are flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI can help you with that. Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. These warnings are false positives, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about them. It's just a precautionary measure on their part, but rest assured that Verus is a legitimate and safe software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But how can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download myself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the CLI to verify the signature. The packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". This way, you can ensure that the download is legitimate and hasn't been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what's the purpose of the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExactly! The `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI are used to verify the authenticity of a Verus download. They check the signature of the download against the expected signature to ensure that the download has not been tampered with. If the signature is valid, the result will be `true`. It's an extra layer of security to give you peace of mind when downloading and installing Verus.",
