    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to update my ARM CLI wallet for Verus. Can you tell me what files I need to download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo update the ARM CLI wallet for Verus, you need to download the latest Wallet from the Verus website (https://verus.io/wallet). Additionally, you will need to have the Verus `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata, and `VRSC.conf` files in their standard locations. Do you know where those files are typically located on your ARM Linux system?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I'm not sure. Where are the standard locations for Verus `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata, and `VRSC.conf` files on ARM Linux?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn ARM Linux, the standard location for Verus `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata, and `VRSC.conf` files is `~/.komodo/VRSC`. However, due to the large size of the blockchain, this directory is often stored on a mounted external hard drive, which may have a non-standard file path specified by the user. Make sure to check your system configuration to confirm the locations of these files.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! By the way, I was thinking of using my Raspberry Pi ARM board to mine some Verus coins. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, Raspberry Pi ARM boards lack some instruction sets required for mining. However, if you have a Raspberry Pi3 or Pi4, you can use them as staking devices if you install an ARM64 operating system. So while you can't mine with your Raspberry Pi, you can still participate in the Verus network through staking.",
