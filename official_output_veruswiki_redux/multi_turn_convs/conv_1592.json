    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have some questions about Verus. What kind of warranty or liability does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. I've had some issues with antivirus software flagging Verus as suspicious. Why do some antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag Verus as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAvast and Kaspersky may flag Verus as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is a mining software. These warnings are intended to inform you that you are installing mining software, which could potentially be used by a third party to exploit your PC. However, these flags are false positives.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Where can I find more information about these false positives from antivirus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about the false positives from antivirus software through the following resources:\nhttps://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/\nhttps://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/\n\nThese resources provide more details about why Verus is flagged as a PUP and how it's a false positive.",
