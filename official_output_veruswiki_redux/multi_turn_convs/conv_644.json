    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating my own currency on Verus, but I'm not sure what the requirements are. Can you tell me what I need to do to launch a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a new currency on Verus, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST, and have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specified rate in order to launch. Additionally, the launch process takes place as part of the mining process, and miners earn 0.025% conversion fees for participating in the launch. Do you have any questions about this process or would you like to know more about launching a currency on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thank you. I'm also wondering, how can I convert VRSCTEST to a new token, like GOLD, before the token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` command to park your conversion until the token launches. The command would look like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned. Have you tried using the `sendcurrency` command before?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really useful, thanks. I've been thinking about creating my own token, mycoin, that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a new token using the `definecurrency` command, specifying the properties of the new token, such as its name, options, currencies it can be converted to, and initial supply. This command allows you to customize your token to fit your needs. Would you like more information on the `definecurrency` command or any other aspect of creating a new token on Verus?",
