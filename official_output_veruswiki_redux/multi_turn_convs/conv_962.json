    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I need some help with importing multiple WIFs for private addresses in Verus. Do you know how I can do that in one batch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo import multiple WIFs, you can follow these steps. Go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use, and enter the following command for every WIF except the final one:\n```\nrun z_importkey \"<wif>\" \"no\"\n```\nThen, import the final WIF with this command:\n```\nrun z_importkey \"<wif>\" \"yes\" 1\n```\nThis last command triggers the chain to rescan all addresses in your wallet, including all the addresses you just imported. Do you have any questions about this process or need further assistance?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I tried importing multiple WIFs, but the GUI wallet doesn't show any progress on the import. It just gives me messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting. What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's normal behavior, don't worry. The GUI wallet may not show any progress on the import, and may display messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting. This is because the import process will take some time to finish in the background, especially if the address has many transactions on it. You should just wait for the process to complete. It might take a while, but it'll get there.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But one more thing, what should I replace `<wif>` with when importing WIFs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen importing WIFs, you should replace `<wif>` with the actual WIF you generated using the `convertpassphrase` command in the Verus Desktop CLI interface. Do not use the WIF from the example provided. Make sure to use the actual WIF you generated, and you should be good to go!",
