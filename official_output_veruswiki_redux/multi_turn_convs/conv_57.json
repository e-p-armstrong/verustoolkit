    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a Verus multi-signature ID and I want to sign a transaction. How can I do that on the Verus testnet or mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the transaction and get the raw transaction data using:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\n2. Get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency` and use it to get the raw hex transaction data with:\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it with:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\nMake sure to replace the placeholders with your actual values. If you have any questions or issues, feel free to ask!\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! I've heard about the new Verus testnet, what are the key features of it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou're welcome!

Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains.\n\nThese features make it a very powerful and versatile platform. Do you have any questions about these features or want to know more about the testnet?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds impressive! What makes the Verus testnet unique compared to other cryptocurrency platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus testnet stands out from other cryptocurrency platforms due to its intrinsic decentralization, multi-chain capabilities, and unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains.
