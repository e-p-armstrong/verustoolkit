    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nSo, what happens when the revocation authority revokes an ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the revocation authority revokes an ID, it creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds. This can be useful, for example, in the case of key theft. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat does. What's the purpose of the recovery authority in a Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe recovery authority can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state. However, it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority. It's like having a backup plan for your ID.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what kind of addresses are included in a Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach Verus ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. They're pretty versatile.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the content map of key-value hashes in a Verus ID? What's that for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe content map of key-value hashes is intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available. It's like having a secure and private storage for your identity-related data.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really powerful. Does Verus have a built-in mechanism to encourage growth and adoption?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, Verus has a built-in decentralized referral program that enables natural growth. This program incentivizes users to invite others to join the network, which helps to grow the community and increase adoption. It's a win-win for everyone involved!",
