    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating my own currency on the Verus network. What are the requirements for launching a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a new currency on the Verus network, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST. Additionally, 1000 VRSCTEST must be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per unit of the new currency in order to launch. The launch process is part of the mining process, and the miners who participate in the launch earn a 0.025% conversion fee.\n\nDo you have a specific currency in mind that you'd like to launch? Or would you like more information on the launch process?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I was thinking of creating a new token, like GOLD, and I want to convert some VRSCTEST to it before it launches. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to a new token, like GOLD, before the token launches by using the `sendcurrency` command with the `preconvert` option. This will effectively park your conversion until the token launches. Here's an example command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nAfter the token launches, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nMake sure to replace \"mike@\" with your actual address, and adjust the amount according to your needs. Do you have any questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! Now, I want to create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you need to define the new token's properties using the `definecurrency` command. This command allows you to specify the name of the token, the options, proof protocol, currencies that can be converted to, and other properties.\n\nYou can use the `definecurrency` command to set up the new token and specify GOLD and VRSCTEST as convertible currencies. This will allow users to convert their GOLD or VRSCTEST to your new token once it's launched.\n\nDo you need more information on how to use the `definecurrency` command, or would you like an example of how to set it up?",
