    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been doing some signature verification and I'm not entirely sure what the results mean. What does the result `true` indicate when verifying a signature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen verifying a signature, the result `true` indicates that the signature is valid. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about signature verification?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that the v1.0.4 upgrade is important for mainnet DeFi or cross-chain wallet functions. Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v1.0.4 upgrade is critical for mainnet DeFi or cross-chain wallet functions because it rectifies potential refund failures in edge cases. Although it is not required for mainnet synchronization or mainnet function past PBaaS activation, it is highly recommended to ensure proper functionality. Would you like to know more about the improvements included in this upgrade?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that would be great. What are some of the mainnet improvements included in the v1.0.4 upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the mainnet improvements included in the v1.0.4 upgrade are:\n\n* Properly inserting refund addresses in all cases when making DeFi or cross-chain transactions\n* Merge mining improvements for higher performance on all platforms\n* CLI now defaults to mainnet for all PBaaS chains unless -testnet is specified\n* 2 versions of GUI will be released, a mainnet and separate testnet version\n* Extends deprecation height from 20 weeks to 52 weeks\n\nThese improvements should provide a more stable and efficient experience on the mainnet. Do you have any questions about these improvements or would you like to know about testnet fixes and improvements?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I'd like to know about testnet fixes and improvements.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the testnet fixes and improvements included in the v1.0.4 upgrade are:\n\n* Separate GUI release for testnet\n* Refund address fix\n\nThese changes should help ensure that the testnet is stable and functioning as intended. Do you have any more questions about the v1.0.4 upgrade or its improvements?",
