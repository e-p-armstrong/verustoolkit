    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the `sendrawtransaction` command in Verus. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendrawtransaction` command is used to submit a raw transaction (serialized and hex-encoded) to the local node and network. This allows you to manually create and broadcast transactions to the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What are the required and optional arguments for the `sendrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required argument is \"hexstring\", which is a string representing the hex-encoded raw transaction. The optional argument is \"allowhighfees\", a boolean value that defaults to false, which allows high fees if set to true.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What's the result of using the `sendrawtransaction` command? What can I expect to get back?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of using the `sendrawtransaction` command is a string representing the transaction hash in hex. This is the unique identifier for the transaction on the Verus network.",
