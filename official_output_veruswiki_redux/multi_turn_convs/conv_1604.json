    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the results of operations in Verus. Can you tell me what the result of an operation in Verus contains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of an operation in Verus contains an \"operationid\" which is a string that can be used to retrieve the status of the operation using the \"z_getoperationstatus\" command. This operationid is a unique identifier for the operation, and it's how you can keep track of its status.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I also noticed that there's an option to set \"returntxtemplate\" to true in an operation result. What additional information is returned if I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf \"returntxtemplate\" is set to true, the operation result will also contain a JSON object with two properties: \"outputtotals\" and \"hextx\". \"outputtotals\" is a currency value map that represents the total outputs in all currencies that need to be input to the transaction. \"hextx\" is a hexadecimal string that represents the transaction with all specified outputs and no inputs. This can be really useful if you need to build the transaction manually or inspect its details.",
