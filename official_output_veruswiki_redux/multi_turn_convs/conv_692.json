    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in launching a PBaaS blockchain on Verus. What features are available to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers several features for launching a PBaaS blockchain, including lunch and/or crowdfunding options, on-chain auto-refund options for missed targets, automatic Ethereum ERC20 contract deployment, auto-created, MEV-resistant, liquidity baskets, and even auto-bridged, merge mineable, fully independent rent-free PBaaS blockchain launches.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great. How are DeFi AMM conversions verified on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, all DeFi AMM conversions are verified via mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol. This means that all conversions in a single liquidity basket are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block, ensuring that all participants get the same price in all directions of conversion. The conversion fee ranges from a minimum of 0.025% to a maximum of 0.05%.\n\n**User:**\nHow are currencies and identities validated on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, all currencies and identities are primitives at L1 and are validated and verified on UTXO transactions. This means that all inputs and outputs of transactions are checked, similar to how single-currency L1 blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin verify native currency transactions.\n\n**User:**\nCan currencies on Verus be sent to other networks, and if so, how?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, currencies on Verus can be sent to other networks. Once launched, currencies on independent connected chains can be sent back and forth to other multi-currency capable networks, such as other independent PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are \"mapped currencies\" on Verus, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, \"mapped currencies\" are currencies that are defined to map 1:1 to an existing currency on Ethereum, such as DAI. These mapped currencies can be sent from Ethereum with simple transactions and received and used as the new mapped currency, or sent back to Ethereum and used there as the original currency.\n\n**User:**\nHow can currency launches raise funds on Verus, and what are the implications for the currency's price?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrency launches on Verus can raise funds in three ways. Each of these fundraising options creates a currency that is not 100% backed and has a price that responds to market forces. In contrast, 100% backed currencies do not change their relative price to the underlying basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, take their funding from the reserve and have a price that responds to market forces.",
