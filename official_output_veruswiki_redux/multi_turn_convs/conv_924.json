    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been learning about VerusIDs and Verus Vault, and I have a few more questions. What are the requirements for enabling revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities, you must have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This allows you to set up the necessary authorities to manage your IDs and assets. Do you have any questions about setting up these IDs or configuring Verus Vault?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering, how does Verus Vault protect against the 5-dollar wrench attack?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault provides protection against the 5-dollar wrench attack by allowing you to set an unlock delay, such as a 24-hour delay, on your locked IDs. This means that even if someone tries to unlock your ID using a 5-dollar wrench attack, they will have to wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can access the funds. During this time, the revocation and recovery authority identities can detect the unauthorized unlock and revoke and recover the ID, preventing the attacker from accessing the funds. You can rest assured that your assets are safe even in the event of a physical attack.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really reassuring. What are some of the additional features and use cases of Verus Vault, beyond just protecting funds from unauthorized access?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault provides additional features and use cases, such as protecting IDs and NFTs, time locks for vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance, and preserving generational blockchain wealth. Verus Vault provides a decentralized solution for protecting and recovering funds, IDs, and NFTs, as well as other blockchain assets. It's a robust and versatile tool for managing your digital identity and assets.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also interested in using Verus to export an ID to a PBaaS chain. Can you walk me through how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\n\nThis command exports the ID \"IDNAME@\" to the PBaaS chain \"PBaaSChainName\" with an amount of 100 VRSCTEST. Just replace the placeholders with your actual ID name, chain name, and currency, and you're good to go! Do you have any questions about this process or need further assistance?",
