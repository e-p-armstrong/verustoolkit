    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've downloaded Verus and I noticed that there's a txt file that comes with it. What's included in that file and what's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe txt file includes the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. This file is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the downloaded archive. It's an important step to ensure that the archive hasn't been tampered with or corrupted during the download process.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How do I actually verify the signature of the downloaded archive using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the signature of a downloaded Verus archive using the `verifyfile` command. The basic format of the command is:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"signer_id@\" \"signature\" \"path_to_archive\"\n```\nReplace `signer_id@` with the ID of the signer, `signature` with the actual signature, and `path_to_archive` with the path to the downloaded archive. Just run this command in your terminal, and it will let you know if the signature is valid.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I've run the command. What does it mean if the result of the verification command is \"true\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the result of the verification command is \"true\", it means that the signature is valid, and the downloaded archive has not been tampered with or corrupted during the download process. You can be confident that the archive is authentic and hasn't been modified in any way. Congratulations, you've successfully verified the signature of your Verus download!",
