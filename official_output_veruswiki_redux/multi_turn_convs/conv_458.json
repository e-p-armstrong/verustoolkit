    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've set up a multi-signature ID on the Verus testnet. Now I need to sign a transaction from this ID. Can you walk me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency`.\n2. Get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency` and use it to retrieve the raw hex transaction data with `verus z_getoperationstatus`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it with `verus signrawtransaction`.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this process or need further clarification!\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about the new Verus testnet. What are the key features of this new testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that allows users to:\n\n* Create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way\n* Access the testnet from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets\n\nIt's a really exciting development for the Verus ecosystem!\n\n**User:**\nWhat makes the Verus testnet unique compared to other cryptocurrency platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus testnet is unique in that it allows users to do many things that are not possible on other cryptocurrency platforms, including creating new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming, and sending currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease. It's a truly decentralized and flexible platform that gives users a lot of power and control over their digital assets.",
