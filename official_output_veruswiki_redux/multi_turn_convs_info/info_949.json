            "What is Verus Fee Pooling technology and how does it address concerns about blockchain security and fee distribution?",
            "Verus Fee Pooling technology is a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model that strengthens blockchain security by preserving the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time. In this model, all fees from transactions in a block are gathered and added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees. The current block miner or staker then takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.",

In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",

            "Verus Vault is a capability introduced on the Verus testnet that provides advanced time locking of identities. It enables a theft-resistant workflow of identity management and unlocks various use cases such as trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, estate planning, and more. When combined with the revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID, Verus Vault has immense ramifications for secure and flexible identity management.",
