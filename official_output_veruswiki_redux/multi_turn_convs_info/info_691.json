            "The VerusID protocol enables users to create and manage their own decentralized identities, which can be used as friendly names for cryptocurrency addresses on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. This protocol allows for virtually theft-proof workflows and solutions to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. Additionally, users can choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID, further enhancing security.",

This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.\n## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming\n- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets\n- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n",
