            "What are some key features of Verus version v0.7.1-5, specifically related to TestNet protocols?",
            "Verus version v0.7.1-5 has several key features, including:\n\n1. Increased scale over previous versions\n2. Ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency\n3. Price neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies",
            "# Enhancements to TestNet Protocols for Increased Scale, Currency Burn Functions, and Centralized Fractional Currencies\nVersion v0.7.1-5 is not yet considered hardened for mainnet, but has increased scale over previous versions in addition to the ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency. This allows price neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. This version also enables a new parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API called \"burn\". If \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent, which must be a token or fractional currency is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.# An end to front running\nConversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.",

            "The \"burn\" parameter in the \"sendcurrency\" API allows a currency to be officially removed from the supply when sent. If \"burn\" is set to 1, the currency sent (which must be a token or fractional currency) is removed from the supply.

            "Verus prevents front running by ensuring that all transactions in an aggregation of import blocks are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions, and all converted at the same rate. This means that there is no spread between the conversion to and from a currency, and all users get the same price in each direction.
