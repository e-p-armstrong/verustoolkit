Additionally, each identity refers to three authorities:\n\n1. **Primary**: The self-identity, which can modify any part of the identity except its name, parent, and data under the control of other authorities.\n2. **Revocation**: An identity that can revoke the primary identity, effectively freezing all funds and transactions under its control.\n3. **Recovery**: An authority that can redefine or recover a revoked identity, but cannot change the revocation authority or modify an unrevoked identity.",
