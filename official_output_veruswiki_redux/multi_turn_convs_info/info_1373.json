            "What is the purpose of a locked VerusID, and how can it be recovered in case of unauthorized access?",
            "A locked VerusID provides an additional layer of security by requiring a predetermined unlock time before funds can be accessed. This time delay allows the revocation and recovery authority identities to take action in case of unauthorized access. Even if an attacker gains access to the primary keys, they will have to wait for the unlock time before they can spend or access the funds, giving the revocation and recovery authorities time to intervene and recover the funds.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",

            "How does Verus Vault protect against the 5-dollar wrench attack?",
            "Verus Vault provides a decentralized solution to the 5-dollar wrench attack by allowing users to set a time delay (e.g., 24 hours) on their locked IDs. This means that even if an attacker gains access to the primary keys, they will have to wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can access the funds, giving the user or a designated revocation and recovery authority time to intervene and recover the funds.",
