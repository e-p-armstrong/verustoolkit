            "To launch a currency on the Verus network, it must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST, and have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specific rate (e.g., 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) before the launch can occur. This process is part of the mining process, and mining the blocks that launch a currency earns conversion fees.",
