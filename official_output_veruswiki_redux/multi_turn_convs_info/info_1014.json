            "On Verus, blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches can be set up with minimum required levels of worldwide participation in preferred currencies. If the minimum levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations, and vesting schedules.",
