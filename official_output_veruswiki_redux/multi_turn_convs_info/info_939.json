            "What is a limitation of creating a currency from an ID in Verus, and why is it not recommended?",
            "One limitation of creating a currency from an ID in Verus is that you cannot make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is not recommended because using an i-address as the name of an ID will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used, and will not be supported for creating currencies.",
            "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2.

            "In the current testnet release, you cannot use a currency name like BTC or ETH for a PBaaS chain in the Verus Desktop because these currencies are already supported in the Verus Desktop. However, this limitation is considered errata and will be resolved before mainnet availability.",
