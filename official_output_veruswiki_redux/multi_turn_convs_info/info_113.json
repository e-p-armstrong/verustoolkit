            "What is the Decentralized Ethereum Bridge, and what benefits does it bring to the Verus network?",
            "The Decentralized Ethereum Bridge is a gateway that allows for the transfer of assets between the Verus network and the Ethereum network. It includes a 1:1 provably mapped currency called \"vETH\" on the Verus network, which enables the seamless transfer of assets between the two networks. This bridge also provides a decentralized and fair launch mechanism, allowing for the permissionless registration of *.vETH IDs, which can be used to create mapped currencies that can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network.",
            "5) **Decentralized Ethereum Bridge**: Shortly after PBaaS activates on mainnet, the Ethereum bridge will launch as a decentralized gateway and 1:1 provably mapped currency called \u201cvETH\u201d on the Verus network, also available to all PBaaS chains. The Ethereum bridge will also include a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI, which will have the following functions:\nAuto conversion of fees from Verus <-> Ethereum when sending cross chain, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket\nPermissionless ability to register *.vETH IDs, which in addition to the normal sub-ID capability of creating a single token that has control over the ID and can be exported to Ethereum as an automatic ERC721 NFT, can alternately be used to create a \u201cmapped currency\u201d, which can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network by exporting it to the vETH bridge. Only Verus root IDs, and IDs of a gateway can create mapped currencies to a gateway.\nDecentralized, fair bridge launch. The vETH bridge will launch as other currencies, chains, and gateways can launch, including the bridge converter. When the bridge launches, the contracts will have a surplus of Verus that comes from the fees paid to launch the gateway. In the protocol, that surplus is first used to solve the chicken and egg problem of none of one currency on the other chain. The contracts will cover the Verus fees for all sends from Ethereum before the Bridge converter launches, the liquidity basket becomes active, and the bridge recognizes that launch. Once that happens, the remainder of \u00bd the fees (5000 VRSC) that are left over from the launch and did not go to miners and stakers or pay Verus fees for people sending from Ethereum",

            "How does the Ethereum bridge handle fees when sending cross-chain transactions?",
            "The Ethereum bridge handles fees by auto-converting them from Verus to Ethereum (or vice versa) based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket. This liquidity basket is a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI, which provides a stable and decentralized mechanism for handling fees.",
