            "Is mining VRSC with Verushash profitable?",
            "Yes, mining VRSC with Verushash is currently one of the most profitable coins to mine with your CPU. However, to determine the profitability, you need to consider several factors, such as the hardware you will use to mine, your energy price, and whether you already have the hardware or need to purchase it.",

            "What hardware can be used to mine VRSC?",
            "You can use a CPU, GPU, or FPGA to mine VRSC. The performance of each type of hardware varies, with modern CPUs (produced in 2013 or later) being the most suitable due to their built-in AES and AVX instructions. GPUs can also be used, but they may not perform as well as modern CPUs. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to mine VRSC and can outperform CPUs if they have multiple processors running in parallel.",

            "To estimate the profitability of mining VRSC, you need to know the performance of your hardware, which can be found in the Verushash Hashrates spreadsheet. Additionally, you need to know your energy price. With this information, you can calculate an estimation of how much your hardware can earn.",
