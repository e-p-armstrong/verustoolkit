            "How do I sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID using the Verus command line?",
            "To sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction using the `sendcurrency` command and get the raw transaction data:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\n2. Get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency` and use it to retrieve the raw hex transaction data using `z_getoperationstatus`:\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using `signrawtransaction`:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `sendrawtransaction`:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```",
