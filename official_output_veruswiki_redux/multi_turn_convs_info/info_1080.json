            "What makes the Verus protocol unique in terms of DeFi and cross-currency liquidity?",
            "The Verus protocol integrates DeFi and cross-currency liquidity with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, making it 51% hash-attack resistant. This integration enables a wide range of capabilities that take DeFi further than any other project in crypto today.",
            "- **DeFi and cross-currency liquidity integrated with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm** - This is a massive set of platform capabilities that take DeFi further than any project in crypto today. We will list it here and describe it below. Using it is simple. Understanding the implications of what such a protocol can do when rent free and integrated in a truly decentralized public blockchain is a process of realizations that is likely to be similar to layers of an onion. We will do our best to explain below.- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.",
