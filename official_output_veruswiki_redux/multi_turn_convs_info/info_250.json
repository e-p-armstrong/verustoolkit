            "PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) chains are decentralized, merge-mineable, and interoperable blockchains that can be created by users using the Verus platform. These chains can send and receive from the Verus chain and benefit from the Verus community's contributions to the daemon, starting with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities.",
            "ed on non-Verus systems.\n## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming\n - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets\n- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain.

            "Verus allows for the simultaneous launch of a blockchain and a decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool.
