            "What is the purpose of the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace?",
            "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain in a decentralized manner. It enables users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the blockchain for everyone to see. Transactions are executed peer-to-peer without intermediaries, and users can pay or offer to pay from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses.",
