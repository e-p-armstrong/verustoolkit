            "What is the concept of a simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launch in Verus?",
            "In Verus, a simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launch refers to the creation of a new blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This bridge converter liquidity pool allows for seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and other blockchains, with fees generated from cross-chain conversions or general use of the liquidity pool being earned on the new blockchain, without any rent going back to the Verus blockchain.",

Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.
