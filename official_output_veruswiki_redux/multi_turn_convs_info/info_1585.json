            "What does it mean for a VerusID to be recoverable, and how can it be recovered?",
            "A VerusID is recoverable, meaning that it includes a separate recovery authority that can recover the identity by redefining its primary state and recovery state. This recovery authority defaults to the ID itself, but can be set to another ID. The recovery authority cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.",
            "- **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.- **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.\n# VerusHash 2.1\nVerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.\n# Disclaimer",

            "What are some benefits of a VerusID being private, and how does it achieve this privacy?",
            "A VerusID being private means that each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that can be used for messaging, financial transactions, or voting. Additionally, each ID has a content map of key-value hashes that can be used to provide private yet selectively provable claims, attestations, and components of a strong identity. This privacy is achieved through the use of zero-knowledge private addresses and a content map, allowing for selective proof of identity without revealing unnecessary information.",
