            "What is the limitation of using a single public/private key pair as an identity in Bitcoin and its derivatives?",
            "The limitation of using a single public/private key pair as an identity in Bitcoin and its derivatives is that it lacks critical capabilities, such as the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.",
            "Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables. It is also the foundation upon which many new applications and additional capabilities can be built.",

            "How does Verus ID improve upon the identity management capabilities of traditional blockchain-based systems like Bitcoin?",
            "Verus ID improves upon the identity management capabilities of traditional blockchain-based systems like Bitcoin by offering a more comprehensive and robust system that includes features such as friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity. This makes it a more suitable solution for actual identity management, whereas traditional blockchain-based systems are limited in their capabilities.",
