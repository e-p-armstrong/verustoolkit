            "What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does it work?",
            "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) directly on the blockchain. This marketplace allows users to advertise their offers to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT for the entire world to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized and peer-to-peer manner, without the need for intermediaries. Users can pay or offer to pay from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, and accept payment to either as well.",
