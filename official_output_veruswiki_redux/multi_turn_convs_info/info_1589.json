Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands to verify the signature. For example:\n\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <file_path>\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <checksum>\n```\n\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.",
