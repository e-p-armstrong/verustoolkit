            "What features does Verus offer to make launching a new currency easier and more flexible?",
            "Verus provides several features to simplify and customize the process of launching a new currency. These include:\n\n1. **Kickstarter-like minimums**: A minimum amount of support is required to activate the currency launch, and if not met, funds are automatically refunded.\n2. **Dynamic pricing**: The launch price of the currency is determined by participation, ensuring that the price is fair and reflects demand.\n3. **Pre-launch discounts**: Participants who contribute early can receive discounts on their purchases.\n4. **Pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts**: A portion of the currency can be reserved for specific purposes, such as community incentives or strategic partnerships.\n5. **Price-neutral launch pre-allocations**: The allocation of currencies can be set up in a way that ensures a fair and balanced distribution.\n\nAll of these features are accessible through easy-to-understand commands and parameters, without requiring any programming knowledge.",

Verus import/export protocol was designed to make integration with other block chains provable and easy, and there are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, where currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network, and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.# Preparing for Multi-chain, Dynamic Merge Mining\nWhile this 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology which was running on testnet last year. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously.
