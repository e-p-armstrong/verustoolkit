            "What is Verus Fee Pooling technology, and how does it address concerns about blockchain security?",
            "Verus Fee Pooling technology is a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model that strengthens blockchain security. It preserves the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time. In this model, all fees from transactions in a block are gathered and added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees. The current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool. This approach addresses concerns about blockchain security and fee distribution, as raised by Vitalik Buterin.",

The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",

            "How does Verus Fee Pooling technology benefit miners and stakers?",
            "Verus Fee Pooling technology benefits miners and stakers by providing a more sustainable and secure fee and revenue model. It allows them to maximize their fees while also smoothing out the distribution of fees over time, reducing the risk of volatility and uncertainty. This approach incentivizes miners and stakers to continue to secure the blockchain, ensuring the integrity and security of the network.",
