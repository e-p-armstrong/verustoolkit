            "Verus PBaaS Reserve technology allows any organization to create its own fractional reserve currency on an independent blockchain with cross-chain interoperability, without additional costs beyond public blockchain network fees. This enables immediate use for payments and conversions to other currencies from within the Verus wallet.",
            "With no costs beyond public blockchain network fees, Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization of any size to make a fractional reserve currency of its own on an independent, uncluttered blockchain with cross-chain interoperability, and immediately useful for payments and conversion to other currencies from within the Verus wallet. 100% of the 0.01% fees for such conversions go directly to the miners and stakers of the organization's new chain, and those miners and stakers also have the option of merge mining up to 14 other blockchains and coins while mining their own project, improving efficiency, profitability, and shared liquidity for everyone involved.
