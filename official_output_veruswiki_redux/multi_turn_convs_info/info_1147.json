            "What are some potential use cases for Verus Vault's time-locking capability?",
            "Verus Vault's time-locking capability can be used for a variety of purposes, including providing time-locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured to provide time-locked deal and payment terms. It can also be used for theft resistance and delayed lock opening. The technology has many potential uses beyond these examples, and its applications are still being explored.",

This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms.
