            "What kind of blockchains can be set up on the Verus network, and how do they interact with each other?",
            "The Verus network supports both public and private, internal blockchains. These private blockchains are easy to set up and can be bridged to public currencies, allowing for seamless transfer of assets between the public chain and the internal network. The Verus network can support an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains, with some overhead for cross-notarization. This enables organizations to have their own private blockchains with all the features and currencies of the public chain, but without the public access.",

            "How can I lock an ID on the Verus network, and what are the different types of locks available?",
            "There are two types of locks available for IDs on the Verus network: Time Lock and Time Delay. A Time Lock sets an unlock height for the identity, which can be done using the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter set to the desired unlock block height. A Time Delay sets a delay in blocks before an ID can be unlocked after its flags are set back to an unlocked state. This can be done using the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter set to the desired unlock block delay. Note that revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of the time delay or unlock height, and a locked identity cannot revoke itself.",
