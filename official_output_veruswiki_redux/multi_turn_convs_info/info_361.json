            "Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?",
            "Verus software may be flagged as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) by antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky because it includes mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about these false positives.",

            "How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?",
            "To verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the CLI to verify the signature. The `verifyfile` command takes the signer's identity, the signature, and the file path as arguments, while the `verifyhash` command takes the signer's identity, the signature, and the file hash as arguments. If the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.",
