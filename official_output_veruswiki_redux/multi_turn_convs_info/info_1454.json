            "What does the `definecurrency` command do in Verus, and how can I use it to create a new token?",
            "The `definecurrency` command in Verus is used to create a new token by defining its properties. You can use it to specify the name of the token, its options, proof protocol, currencies it can be converted to, conversion rates, and minimum pre-conversion amounts. For example, the following command defines a new token called \"mycoin\" with specific properties:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":96, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"conversions\":[0.01, 1.0],\"minpreconversion\":[1000,1000]}'\n```",
            "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":96, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"conversions\":[0.01, 1.0],\"minpreconversion\":[1000,1000]}'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.

            "What does it mean when the `proofprotocol` is set to 2 in the `definecurrency` command?",
            "When the `proofprotocol` is set to 2, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. For example, after defining a token with `proofprotocol` set to 2, the controller can mint new coins using the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
            "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":96, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"conversions\":[0.01, 1.0],\"minpreconversion\":[1000,1000]}'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID.
