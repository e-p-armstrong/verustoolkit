            "What is an implied volatility fee, and how does it work?",
            "An implied volatility fee is a fee that is intended to be added to the Verus network in the future. This fee will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, meaning that blocks that significantly change the price of a currency will pay more of an implied volatility fee. The purpose of this fee is to ensure that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers' risk with earnings from implied volatility fees.",
