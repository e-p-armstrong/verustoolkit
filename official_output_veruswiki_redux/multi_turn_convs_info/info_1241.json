            "What is the purpose of the `z_shieldcoinbase` command in Verus?",
            "The `z_shieldcoinbase` command is used to shield transparent coinbase funds by sending them to a shielded zaddr. This is an asynchronous operation that locks the utxos selected for shielding. If there is an error, the utxos are unlocked.",

This is an asynchronous operation and utxos selected for shielding will be locked. If there is an error, they are unlocked. The RPC call `listlockunspent` can be used to return a list of locked utxos. The number of coinbase utxos selected for shielding can be limited by the caller. If the limit parameter is set to zero, and Overwinter is not yet active, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option will determine the number of uxtos.
