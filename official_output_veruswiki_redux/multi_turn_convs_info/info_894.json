            "The Verus network allows for the creation of DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions using a particular liquidity pool and mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing issues like miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities.",
