            "What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does it work?",
            "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where you can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) directly on the blockchain. You can advertise your offer to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of your NFT for the entire world to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, allowing you to pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address. You can also accept payment to either type of address, and execute transactions directly, peer-to-peer, without any intermediary.",
