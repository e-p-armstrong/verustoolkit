            "Verus Vault provides a decentralized solution to protect and recover funds, IDs, and NFTs from common forms of crypto loss or theft. It offers a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, including features like time locks for vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.

            "How does Verus Vault protect against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\"?",
            "Verus Vault provides protection against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" by allowing users to set a delay time for unlocking their funds. This means that even if an unauthorized party gains access to the primary keys, they will have to wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access the funds. In the meantime, the revocation and recovery authority identities can detect the unauthorized unlock attempt and revoke and recover the funds, preventing the loss or theft.",
