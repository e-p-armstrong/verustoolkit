            "To mint new coins of a currency that you have defined with PROOF_CHAINID as the proof protocol, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command would mint 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and send them to the address \"mike@\".",
