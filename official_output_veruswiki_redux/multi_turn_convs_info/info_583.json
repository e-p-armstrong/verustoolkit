            "What are the requirements for enabling revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities?",
            "To enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities, you need to have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.",
            "IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet\nWith an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions.

            "How does a locked VerusID work, and what are the benefits of using revocation and recovery authority identities?",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. This means that even if someone gains access to the primary keys, they must first unlock the ID and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. Meanwhile, the revocation and recovery authority identities can revoke and recover the ID at any time, providing an additional layer of security and decentralized funds recovery.",
