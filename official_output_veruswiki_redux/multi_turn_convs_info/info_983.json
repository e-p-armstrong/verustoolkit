            "How do I sign transactions from a multi-signature ID on the Verus testnet or mainnet?",
            "To sign transactions from a multi-signature ID, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction with the `sendcurrency` command, specifying the multi-signature ID and the transaction details.\n2. Get the raw transaction data using `z_getoperationstatus` with the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n4. Use `signrawtransaction` to sign the transaction with each additional wallet.\n5. After all necessary signatures are applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `sendrawtransaction` with the signed transaction data.",

Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.",
