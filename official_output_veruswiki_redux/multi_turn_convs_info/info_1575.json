            "What are the requirements to enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities?",
            "To enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities, you must have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.",

At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds.
