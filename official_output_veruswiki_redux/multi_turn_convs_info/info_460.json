            "What does the formula for estimating the average time to find a block assume about my hashrate?",
            "The formula assumes that your hashrate is already included in the `NetworkHashrate`. If you want to calculate the average time to find a block for a hypothetical scenario where you have a very large hashrate, you should add your hashrate to the `NetworkHashrate` before plugging in the values.",
