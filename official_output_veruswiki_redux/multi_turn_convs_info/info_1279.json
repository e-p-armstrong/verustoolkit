            "How can I create a new token called \"mycoin\" using the command line, which can be converted to with either VRSCTEST or GOLD?",
            "To create a new token called \"mycoin\" using the command line, you can use the `definecurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":96, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"conversions\":[0.01, 1.0],\"minpreconversion\":[1000,1000]}'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\". Some important notes about this configuration:\n\n1. `proofprotocol` being set to 2 means that it's set to PROOF_CHAINID, which means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.\n2. `options` is a configurable integer, in this case set to 96.\n3. `currencies` lists which tokens can be converted to mycoin.\n4. `conversions` defines the conversion ratios between mycoin and each currency on the chain.\n5. `minpreconversion` sets the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin, respectively.",
            "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":96, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"conversions\":[0.01, 1.0],\"minpreconversion\":[1000,1000]}'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/VRSCTEST\n~/.verustest\n```**MacOS**\n```\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest\n```**Windows**\n```\n\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST\n\"%APPDATA%\"\\VerusTest\n```**Launching the testnet:**\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST\n```\n# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
