            "How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?",
            "To verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands provided by the Verus CLI. These commands use a txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, which is included with each download. The packages are signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". You can extract the archive, verify the signature, and then extract the archive to the desired directory.",
