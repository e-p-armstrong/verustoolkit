            "To initiate a currency launch on Verus, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST, and have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specified rate (e.g., 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch. This process happens as part of the mining process, and the mining of blocks that launch a currency earns conversion fees.",
