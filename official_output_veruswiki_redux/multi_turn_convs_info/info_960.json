            "To launch a new currency on the Verus network, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST. Additionally, 1000 VRSCTEST must be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per unit of the new currency. This process is part of the mining process, and the conversion fees are earned by miners who participate in the launch.",
