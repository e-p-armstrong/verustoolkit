            "The Verus invention of consensus-capable oracle notifications in the core protocol enables dynamic coordinated consensus changes that can be triggered at a time decided after the actual release, without compromising decentralization. This allows for seamless decentralized network upgrades.",
            "2. **Enabling Seamless Decentralized Network Upgrades**: This release includes a Verus invention of consensus-capable oracle notifications built into the core protocol, which enable dynamic coordinated consensus changes that can be triggered at a time decided after the actual release which enables them, all without any compromise on decentralization. The Verus Community may decide that we are ready to go earlier than one week on this upgrade and activate it, even before its scheduled time. The good news is that this first test upgrade will primarily affect testnet and prepare for the mainnet PBaaS upgrade, so it is a perfect test case for a mainnet test run before we #LaunchPBaaS. This release actually has the ability to upgrade mainnet to PBaaS, but we believe it is prudent to have at least some time on this new protocol on testnet before the v1.0 release, which will upgrade mainnet. If we make no additional changes to the protocol in this release, which we do not intend to do at this time, this version may be able to follow the v1.0 upgrade. If we determine that it cannot, the oracle upgrade technology will enable the daemon to recognize that it is not capable and request that the user upgrade to a newer version without requiring a bootstrap for the upgrade. **(Mainnet + Testnet)**",
