            "How do I back up my wallet in Verus, and what should I do with the backup file?",
            "To back up your wallet in Verus, you can use the `backupwallet` command. The exact command depends on your operating system and whether you're using the desktop client or command-line interface (CLI). \n\nFor the desktop client, go to `Settings`, then `Coin Settings`, and type `run backupwallet \"<DestinationFileName>\"` in the text box. \n\nFor the CLI on Linux or MacOS, use `./verus backupwallet \"<DestinationFileName>\"`. \n\nFor the CLI on Windows, use `verus backupwallet \"<DestinationFileName>\"`.\n\nThe command will create a backup file called `<DestinationFileName>` in the same directory as your `wallet.dat` file. This file should be kept secure, as it grants full access to all your addresses. Verify that the file exists and has the same size as your `wallet.dat` file.",
