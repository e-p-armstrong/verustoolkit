            "When creating a currency from an ID with a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, you will not be able to use that i-address to refer to the currency. Instead, the i-address will be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. This can cause problems in many cases and is not supported for creating currencies.",

Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.
