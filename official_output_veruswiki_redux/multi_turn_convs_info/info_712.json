            "Private, internal blockchains on the Verus network offer ease of setup, easy bridging of public currencies, and all features and currencies of the public chain, but with restricted access. Additionally, there is no limit to the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on the Verus network, allowing for unlimited scalability and flexibility.",

There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.

            "How can I lock an ID on the Verus network, and what is the purpose of the \"timelock\" parameter?",
            "To lock an ID, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter set to a specific block height. This specifies the unlock height of the identity. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nThe `timelock` parameter can also be used to set a time delay for unlocking an ID when its flags are set back to an unlocked state.",
