            "Why do some antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?",
            "Some antivirus software may flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it detects the presence of mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review the resources provided to understand more about these false positives.",
