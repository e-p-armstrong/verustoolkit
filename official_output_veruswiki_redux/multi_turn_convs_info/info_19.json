            "Antivirus software may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it includes mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about the issue.",

            "At block 800200, the Verus mainnet protocol will undergo a hard fork, and it is mandatory to upgrade to the latest software version to remain on the Verus mainnet. If you don't upgrade, you may need to resynchronize the blockchain if you are running in native mode.",
