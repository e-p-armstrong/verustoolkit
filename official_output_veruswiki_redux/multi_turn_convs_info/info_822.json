You must be updated to v0.9.5 or later by that time to reliably stay synchronized to the Verus mainnet. We are also working to get a mandatory update release during these next couple weeks, which will have the Verus PBaaS mainnet upgrade finalized as well. If you would prefer to wait for the PBaaS mainnet upgrade and upgrade once, we cannot guarantee that the PBaaS mainnet release will be available in the next couple weeks, but we are working to make that a reasonable choice as well. Please make sure that if you do choose to wait to upgrade that you do upgrade to the latest release before Saturday, November 19th.## New Signature Capabilities on Mainnet & Testnet\nIn addition to continued support for all of the `signmessage`, `signdata`, and `signfile` APIs, as well as their verify* counterparts, v0.9.5 introduces 2 new APIs and CLI commands, `signdata` and `verifysignature`, that encompass all of the capabilities of previous signing and verification APIs and add new capabilities for advanced signatures and verification. These new advanced capabilities were designed for community work by @allbits, designing a more powerful and flexible framework for NFTs and ID-bound legal rights and agreements. In addition to digital signing of documents or information using an ID, the new APIs enable easily binding together multiple sources of content, documents, identities, and VDXF keys together into one verifiable signature and then being able to verify that signature, including all of its specific bindings.",
