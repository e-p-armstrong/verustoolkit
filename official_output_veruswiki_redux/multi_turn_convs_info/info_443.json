            "How can I tell the difference between staked and mined coins in Verus?",
            "There are several ways to determine if a coin is staked or mined, depending on the interface you are using. If you are using the CLI, you can check the last 10 transactions using `listtransactions`, copy the blockhash of the received award, and add it to the end of `https://explorer.verus.io/api/getblock?` to see if it's minted or mined. If you are using Verus Desktop, you can go to the Mining Dashboard, enter Verus details, and scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the rewards listed as `mined` or `minted` in green. If you are using Verus Agama, you can click on the magnifying glass next to the transaction, open it in the VRSC Explorer, click on the block hash value, and then click on the info \"i\" to search for the block type, which will show if it's `mined` or `minted`.",

            "The Verus Explorer is a tool that allows you to explore the Verus blockchain and get information about transactions and blocks. You can use it to determine if a coin is staked or mined by adding the blockhash of the received award to the end of `https://explorer.verus.io/api/getblock?` and checking the result. If the result shows that the block type is `mined`, then the coin is mined. If it shows that the block type is `minted`, then the coin is staked.",
