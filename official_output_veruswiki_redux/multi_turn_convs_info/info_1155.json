However, regardless of the presence of other notarizations, PBaaS chains will always follow their proof of power protocol and lock to their witnessed tips as well.",

            "PBaaS chains in Verus ensure a stable chain tip by following their proof of power protocol and locking to their witnessed tips. This means that they prioritize their own internal consensus mechanism over external notarizations, even if they are also using a notary service like Komodo.",
