            "What is the purpose of a locked VerusID, and how can it be revoked and recovered?",
            "A locked VerusID is a feature that provides an additional layer of security to protect your funds and assets. Even with a multisig of primary keys, anyone attempting to access or spend the funds must first unlock the ID, then wait for a predetermined unlock time before they can do so. Meanwhile, the revocation and recovery authority identities can always revoke and recover the ID, circumventing the lock. This allows for a decentralized solution to protect against unauthorized access or the \"5 dollar wrench attack\".",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.
