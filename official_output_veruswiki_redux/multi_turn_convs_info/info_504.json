            "What should I do if my antivirus software flags the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?",
            "If your antivirus software flags the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", it's likely due to the software being a cryptocurrency miner. This is a common warning that you are installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. You can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives.",
