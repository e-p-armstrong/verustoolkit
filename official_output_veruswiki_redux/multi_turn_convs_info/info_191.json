            "What is the main benefit of Verus' Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and cross-chain currency conversion technology?",
            "The main benefit is that it allows anyone to create new blockchains and currencies, with features like scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between currencies at any volume. This technology makes it easy to send currencies cross-chain or convert between currencies, with fully decentralized conversions and a low protocol fee of 0.01%.",
