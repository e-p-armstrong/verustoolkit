            "How do I create a new token in Verus that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?",
            "To create a new token in Verus that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you need to use the `definecurrency` command, specifying the new token's name, options, and conversion rates. For example, you can define a new token called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. The exact command would depend on the specific requirements and conversion rates you want to set for your new token.",

I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",

            "When you send a command to convert VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, the conversion is effectively \"parked\" until the token launches. Once the token launches, you will either receive the converted amount of the new token or have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.",
