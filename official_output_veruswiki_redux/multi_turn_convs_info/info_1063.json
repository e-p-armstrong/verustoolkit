            "What is the purpose of Verus Vault, and how does it protect my funds and assets?",
            "Verus Vault is a decentralized solution that provides an additional layer of security and protection for your funds and assets on the blockchain. It allows you to set a lock on your VerusID, which can be revoked and recovered by designated authorities in case of unauthorized access. This prevents theft and loss of funds, and also provides a way to recover your assets in case of a security breach.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",

            "How does Verus Vault prevent the \"5 dollar wrench attack\"?",
            "Verus Vault prevents the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" by allowing you to set a lock on your VerusID with a predetermined unlock time. This means that even if someone gains access to your primary keys, they will have to wait for the unlock time to expire before they can access your funds. In the meantime, the revocation and recovery authorities can detect the unauthorized access and revoke the lock, preventing the theft of your funds.",
