            "What should I do if my antivirus software flags the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?",
            "If your antivirus software flags the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", it's likely a false positive warning. This warning is indicating that the software is a mining tool, which could potentially be used to exploit your PC if installed by a third party. However, in this case, it's a legitimate part of the Verus protocol. You can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives.",
