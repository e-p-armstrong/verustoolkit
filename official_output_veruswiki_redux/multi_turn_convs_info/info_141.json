            "How can I sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID on the Verus testnet or mainnet?",
            "To sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency`.\n2. Get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency` and use it to retrieve the raw hex transaction data with `verus z_getoperationstatus`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it with `verus signrawtransaction`.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.",
