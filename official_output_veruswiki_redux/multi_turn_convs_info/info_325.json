            "What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does it work?",
            "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. It allows users to advertise their offers to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT publicly for anyone to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized manner, with the option to pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address. This means that users can maintain control over their transactions and identities without the need for intermediaries.",
