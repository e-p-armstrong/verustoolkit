            "To launch a new currency in Verus, you need to fund the currency's identity with at least 10 VRSCTEST and have at least 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at the specified conversion rate. The launch process happens as part of the mining process, where mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new currency.",
