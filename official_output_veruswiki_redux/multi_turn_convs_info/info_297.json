            "To define a new currency on the Verus network, you can use the `definecurrency` command. For example, to define a currency called \"gold\", you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines the currency \"gold\" with a conversion rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD, and requires at least 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at this rate in order to launch. Additionally, the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate the currency launch.",
