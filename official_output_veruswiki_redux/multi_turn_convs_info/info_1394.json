            "How do PBaaS chains work in Verus, and what benefits do they offer?",
            "PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) chains in Verus are decentralized, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchains that can send and receive from the Verus chain. They are merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects can join the worldwide Verus community to improve the daemon, starting with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities.",

The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain.

            "What is the purpose of Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies, and how do they work?",
            "Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies are a type of currency that can be defined by any ID owner. They are backed by one or more asset currencies at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions using a particular liquidity pool and mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing issues like miner-extracted value (MEV) and front-running. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities.",
