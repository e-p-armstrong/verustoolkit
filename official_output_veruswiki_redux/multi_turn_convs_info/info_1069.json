            "When `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new currency, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins.",

            "To mint new coins of a currency with `proofprotocol` set to PROOF_CHAINID, you can use the `sendcurrency` command.
