            "What happens to existing transactions sent to my VerusID if I upgrade to a quantum secure address?",
            "When you upgrade to a quantum secure address, all existing transactions sent to your VerusID will be retroactively secured under the control of that address. This means that even if you have a large number of transactions (e.g. 1000) sent to your identity name/address, they will all be secured by the quantum secure address once it's available.",

            "Verus is designed to be quantum-ready, which means that it has the ability to retroactively secure transactions sent to a VerusID once a quantum secure address is available. This ensures that even if a quantum computer is developed in the future, your transactions will still be secure.",

            "One of the benefits of using a VerusID for receiving transactions is that it allows you to easily upgrade to a quantum secure address in the future, which will retroactively secure all existing transactions sent to that address. This provides an additional layer of security and protection against potential quantum attacks.",
