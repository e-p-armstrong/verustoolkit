            "What is Restricted VerusID Staking for PBaaS Chains, and what are its potential use cases?",
            "Restricted VerusID Staking for PBaaS Chains is a feature that allows only funds controlled by IDs with a parent of that PBaaS chain to stake blocks on that chain. This option can be used to create public/private blockchains and applications, as well as for government, voting security, corporate, or organizational use cases, when combined with restricted forms of ID issuance.",
            "6. **Introducing Restricted VerusID Staking for PBaaS Chains**: This release enables the stretch goal of restricted ID staking as an option for launching PBaaS chains. This option means that on such a PBaaS chain, only funds controlled by IDs with a parent of that PBaaS chain may stake blocks on that chain. When combined with restricted forms of ID issuance, whether approval or referral required and/or referral rewards, this capability opens up an entire new area for public/private blockchains and applications, as well as government, voting security, corporate, or organizational use cases.**(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**\n### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see.
