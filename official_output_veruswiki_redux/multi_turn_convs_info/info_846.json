            "What is the purpose of the `setidentitytimelock` command in Verus?",
            "The `setidentitytimelock` command is used to enable timelocking and unlocking of funds access for an on-chain VerusID. This allows the user to set a specific block height or delay for the identity to be unlocked, after which the identity will be able to spend funds on the blockchain.",
            "### `setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\":absoluteblockheight || \"setunlockdelay\":numberofblocksdelayafterunlock}' (returntx) (feeoffer) (sourceoffunds)`\nEnables timelocking and unlocking of funds access for an on-chain VerusID. This does not affect the lock status of VerusIDs on other chains,\nincluding VerusIDs with the same identity as this one, which has been exported to another chain.Use \"setunlockdelay\" to set a time unlock delay on an identity, which means that once the identity has been unlocked,\nnumberofblocksdelayafterunlock must then pass before the identity will be able to spend funds on this blockchain. Services\nwhich support VerusID authentication and recognize this setting may also choose to prevent funds transfers when an ID is locked.Use \"unlockatblock\" to either unlock, by passing the current block, which will still require waiting for the specified unlock\ndelay, or to set a future unlock height that immediately begins counting down. Unlike an unlock delay, which only starts counting\ndown when the ID is unlocked, an \"unlockatblock\" time lock is absolute and will automatically unlock when the specified\nblock passes.",

            "What is the difference between \"unlockatblock\" and \"setunlockdelay\" in the `setidentitytimelock` command?",
            "\"unlockatblock\" sets an absolute block height at which the identity will be automatically unlocked, whereas \"setunlockdelay\" sets a delay in blocks after the identity has been unlocked before it can spend funds. The key difference is that \"unlockatblock\" is an absolute time lock, whereas \"setunlockdelay\" only starts counting down once the identity is unlocked.",
