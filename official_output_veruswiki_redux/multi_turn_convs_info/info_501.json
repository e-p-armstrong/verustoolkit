            "How do I define a PBaaS chain using the `definecurrency` command in Verus?",
            "You can define a PBaaS chain using the `definecurrency` command by passing two JSON objects as arguments. The first JSON object defines the properties of the PBaaS chain, such as its name, options, currencies, conversions, eras, notaries, nodes, and gateway converter. The second JSON object defines the overridable defaults for the bridge, including the currencies, initial contributions, and initial supply.\n\nHere's an example of the command:\n```json\n./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"options\":330,\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\"],\"conversions\":[1],\"eras\":[{\"reward\":1200000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0}],\"notaries\":[\"Notary1@\",\"Notary2@\",\"Notary3@\"],\"minnotariesconfirm\":2,\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.111:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node1@\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.112:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node2@\"}],\"gatewayconvertername\":\"Bridge\",\"gatewayconverterissuance\":1000000}' '{\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\",\"PBaaSChain\",\"USD\"],\"initialcontributions\":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],\"initialsupply\":3000000}'\n```",
            "Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`\n```json\n./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"options\":330,\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\"],\"conversions\":[1],\"eras\":[{\"reward\":1200000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0}],\"notaries\":[\"Notary1@\",\"Notary2@\",\"Notary3@\"],\"minnotariesconfirm\":2,\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.111:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node1@\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.112:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node2@\"}],\"gatewayconvertername\":\"Bridge\",\"gatewayconverterissuance\":1000000}' '{\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\",\"PBaaSChain\",\"USD\"],\"initialcontributions\":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],\"initialsupply\":3000000}'\n```## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.",

            "What are some limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus?",
            "There are two limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus:\n\n1. You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n2. (GUI only) If a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain.\n\nIt's important to be aware of these limitations to avoid potential issues and confusion when working with multi-currency in Verus.",
