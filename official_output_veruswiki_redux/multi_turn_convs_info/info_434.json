            "How do I format commands on the Windows command line when using Verus?",
            "When using the native Windows command prompt (`cmd.com`), you need to adjust the formatting of commands compared to Linux and MacOS. Specifically, you should:\n\n1. Replace single quotes (`'`) with double quotes (`\"`).\n2. Replace double quotes (`\"`) with escaped double quotes (`\\\"`).",
            "# Remarks on Windows command line formatting:\n\nThe CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS. On the native windows command prompt (`cmd.com`) the formatting is different.\n\n* For windows substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character.\n * For windows substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters.\n\nNote: this only applies to giving commands from the windows command prompt. Verus Desktop will accept commands as listed.\n\nCreated by Oink.vrsc@\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-03-02.",
