            "What are some limitations I should be aware of when creating currencies using multi-currency functionality in Verus?",
            "There are a few limitations to be aware of when creating currencies using multi-currency functionality in Verus. One limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address as a currency name can cause confusion and problems when referring to the currency or identity. Additionally, in the GUI version, you cannot use the names of already supported currencies (like BTC or ETH) as a PBaaS chain.",
            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain.

            "Why can't I use an i-address as the actual name of an ID when creating a currency in Verus?",
            "Using an i-address as the actual name of an ID when creating a currency in Verus is not recommended because it can cause confusion and problems when referring to the currency or identity. This is because an i-address is typically used to refer to a currency or identity based on its name registration, rather than being used as the actual name of the ID.",
