            "What does it mean for a VerusID to be revocable, and how does the revocation process work?",
            "A VerusID is revocable, meaning that it can be revoked by a designated revocation authority. By default, the revocation authority is the ID itself, but it can be set to another ID. When an ID is revoked, a valid transaction is created that prevents the ID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered. This effectively freezes all of its funds, which can be useful in cases like key theft or organizational turnover.",
            "* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of M multisig controls for its primary addresses.",
