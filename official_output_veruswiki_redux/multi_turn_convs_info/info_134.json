            "When you update your identity to use a new, quantum-secure address type, all existing transactions sent to that identity will be subject to the spend conditions of the new address type. This means that if you have multiple transactions sent to your identity, upgrading to a quantum-secure address will retroactively secure all of those transactions under the control of the new address.",

That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.",
