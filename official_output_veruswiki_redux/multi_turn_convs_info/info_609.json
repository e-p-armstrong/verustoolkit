            "When creating a currency from an ID, you cannot use an i-address as the actual name of the ID, because it will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (in many cases). This is because an i-address will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.",
