    "What is staking in the context of Verus, and what are the benefits of participating in it?",
    "In the context of Verus, staking refers to the process of using Verus holdings to secure the network. Anyone can participate in staking, regardless of the amount of $VRSC they have, as there are no minimum requirements to start. By staking, users can help secure the network and potentially earn rewards.",
    "# Staking Staking is accessible for everyone. Use Verus holdings to secure the network. It does not matter how much $VRSC you have, there are no minimum requirements to start staking. On the Verus blockchain UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) are staking, not balances. A large UTXO has more chances of winning a block than a small UTXO. [What is a UTXO?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0UYZ9hDos) ## Solo staking There are a few rules you need to know before you can start staking. | Rules | | :-----| | Wallet Running | | Full Node Required (native mode in Verus Desktop) | | Staking Enabled | | UTXO Eligible After 150 Blocks | | Minimum of 0.00000001 VRSC in Wallet | With solo staking you either win a full block or you win nothing. ::: warning Need help with staking? \ud83d\udcb0 [Join the Verus Discord #staking channel.
