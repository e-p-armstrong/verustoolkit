    "What is the recommended limit for currency supplies in a Verus blockchain, and why is it important to follow this limit?",
    "The recommended limit for currency supplies in a Verus blockchain is 10 billion (with 8 decimal places: 9999999999.99999999). This limit is important to follow because it prevents potential issues with conversions and extended tail emissions over time.",
