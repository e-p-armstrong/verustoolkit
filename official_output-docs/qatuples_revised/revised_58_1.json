    "What are notarizations, and what information do they contain in the context of the Verus-Ethereum Bridge?",
    "Notarizations are digital receipts created by block producers every 10 blocks when there is traffic over the bridge. They contain information such as the stateroot (Merkle Mountain Range for Verus and Merkle Patricia Trie for Ethereum), block height, block hash, and gas price for Ethereum.",
    "## What makes the Verus-Ethereum Bridge secure The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is different because the assets are never in anyone\u2019s custody. This is done through the seamless cooperation between the block producers (worldwide miners and stakers), community notary witnesses, [the Bridgekeeper software](https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verusbridgekeeper) and the [Ethereum smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x71518580f36FeCEFfE0721F06bA4703218cD7F63). At each step during cross-chain transactions the assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent hacks.Every 10 blocks the block producers create a notarization (when there is traffic over the bridge). They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum. The digital receipts, called \u201cnotarizations\", contain, among other things: the \u201cstateroot\u201d ([Merkle Mountain Range](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp) for Verus, [Merkle Patricia Trie](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/) for Ethereum), the blockheight, blockhash and the gas price for Ethereum. The notarizations have to be agreed to by the block producers (miners and stakers) and are then mined into the Verus blockchain.\ud83d\udc49 [Read more here](https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-internet-protocol-vip-provable-decentralized-cross-chain-communication-8d9414a429c5?source=rss----4869a79d7e7f---4) on how the Verus Protocol handles cross-chain communication (PBaaS-chains and more) in a decentralized and provable way.### Safeguards against bridge hacks Threats caused by malicious notary witnesses, or stolen keys to drain funds are not viable against the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. To successfully mount an attack on the bridge, if a majority of witnesses were colluding or got their private keys stolen the following would need to happen:- Colluding, malicious witnesses. - Fake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain. [\ud83d\udc49 Verus Paper: A Provable Hybrid Solution to 51% Hash Attacks](https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf) - Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow chain.These requirements are very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain. The bridge even provides a way to defend against such an unlikely scenario.",
