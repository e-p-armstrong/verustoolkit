    "What is the benefit of using VerusIDs in crowdfunding launches?",
    "Using VerusIDs in crowdfunding launches allows for vesting schedules to be included in the pre-allocations, which provides an additional layer of flexibility and control over the launch process.",
    "The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular basket currency, and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi basket currencies directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.## Bridge converter launches Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain.Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other 100% asset backed or partially asset backed basket currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.## Crowdfunding currency and blockchain launches Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees.The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.## Interoperable, multichain network The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.",
