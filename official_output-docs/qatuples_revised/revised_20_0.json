    "What is the Verus-Ethereum Bridge, and how can I access it?",
    "The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is a non-custodial bridge that allows you to export any currency on Verus to Ethereum as an ERC-20. This enables the use of the currency in the complete Ethereum ecosystem, as well as on the Verus network. You can access the Verus-Ethereum Bridge on both the Testnet and Mainnet. For Testnet, you can access it at https://ethbridge.verustest.net/ (on the Goerli testnet), and for Mainnet, you can access it at https://eth.verusbridge.io.",
    "# Export currency to Ethereum (as ERC-20) Any currency on Verus can be exported to Ethereum as an ERC-20. The currency can then be used in the complete Ethereum ecosystem, and on the Verus network. Sending to and from Verus and Ethereum couldn't be easier.

[\ud83d\udc49 Access the Verus-Ethereum Testnet Bridge](https://ethbridge.verustest.net/) (\u26a0\ufe0f Goerli testnet) ::: ::: tip \u2194\ufe0f Verus-Ethereum Bridge \u2705 For Mainnet! [\ud83d\udc49 Access the Verus-Ethereum Mainnet Bridge](https://eth.verusbridge.io) ::: ### Exporting the currency Now, let\u2019s export a currency from Verus to Ethereum as an ERC-20 over the non-custodial bridge. We must have enough funds to pay for the export. The command to export a currency to Ethereum as an ERC-20: ``` json ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"myVerusID@\" '[{   \"address\":\"0x85a7dE2278E52327471e174AeeB280cdFdC6A68a\",   \"currency\":\"myCurrency\",   \"amount\":0,   \"exportto\":\"veth\",   \"exportcurrency\":true,   \"feecurrency\":\"veth\" }]' ``` Let's break the command down with what you can change. **``myVerusID@``** is the from- and change-address. Can be a VerusID, R-address or i-address. The fee to pay for the export comes from here, and if you paid too much fees the rest will be returned here. **``address``** You can fill in any ETH-address here, it is actually not important what is here. **``currency``** is the name of the currency you wish to export as an ERC-20. E.g. `MyCurrency`, `MyCurrency.vETH`. ### Wait for notarization After the bridge has been notarized to the blockheight where you have exported the currency, you can choose it from the token dropdown on the [Bridge website mainnet](https://eth.verusbridge.io) or [Bridge website Goerli testnet](https://ethbridge.verustest.net/)",
