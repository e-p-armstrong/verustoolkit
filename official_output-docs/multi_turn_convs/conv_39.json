    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus, VerusIDs, and VerusPay. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHi! I've been looking into VerusPay and I have a few questions about it. What's the purpose of the `VERUSPAY_VALID` flag in a VerusPay invoice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `VERUSPAY_VALID` flag (value: 1) indicates that the invoice is valid and can be processed. This flag must be set for the invoice to be considered actionable. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about VerusPay invoices?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What does the `VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_CONVERSION` flag allow in a VerusPay invoice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_CONVERSION` flag (value: 2) specifies that the invoice accepts currency conversions. This allows payments in different currencies, with conversion to the invoice's requested currency. If an invoice accepts conversion, it requires a max estimated slippage value. Do you have any more questions about this flag or VerusPay in general?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. What about the `VERUSPAY_EXPIRES` flag? What's its purpose in a VerusPay invoice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `VERUSPAY_EXPIRES` flag (value: 8) determines that the invoice has an expiry condition. If set, the invoice must be paid before a specific Verus blockchain height is reached, and an expiry height must be set. Does that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nYes, thank you! What does the `VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_ANY_DESTINATION` flag allow in a VerusPay invoice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `VERUSPAY_ACCEPTS_ANY_DESTINATION` flag (value: 16) allows the invoice to accept payments to any destination. If set, the destination field in the invoice must be left blank. Do you have any more questions about VerusPay flags or invoices?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I was wondering about something a bit more general. Why is serialization and deserialization important in VerusPay invoices?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSerialization and deserialization are important in VerusPay invoices because they enable a standardized approach to converting the VerusPay Invoice and VerusPay InvoiceDetails into a binary format (serialization) and back (deserialization) to ensure efficient transmission and storage. This process ensures that invoices can be shared, processed, and stored across different systems and languages without loss of fidelity or meaning. Do you have any more questions about VerusPay or serialization/deserialization?",
