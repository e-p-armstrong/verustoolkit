    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the recommended absolute limit for all currency supplies, including conversions and extended tail emissions for blockchains.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe recommended absolute limit for all currency supplies, including conversions and extended tail emissions for blockchains, is 10 billion (minus 1 satoshi) with 8 decimal places, which is 9999999999.99999999. This is a general guideline to ensure that your currency supply doesn't get too large and unwieldy.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful! I've also been curious about \"prelaunchcarveout\" when defining a currency. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n\"prelaunchcarveout\" is used to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the rootID after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, which lowers the reserve ratio, making the currency more volatile. It's a way to adjust the reserve ratio of your currency after launch.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. How do I actually use \"prelaunchcarveout\" when defining a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use \"prelaunchcarveout\" when defining a currency by including it as a property in the JSON object passed to the `definecurrency` command. For example:\n```json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{  \"name\":\"BusinessBrand\",  \"options\":33,  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],  \"initialsupply\":100,  \"prelaunchcarveout\":0.1 }'\n```\nThis would redirect 10% of the preconverted reserves to the rootID after the currency is launched.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about \"prelaunchdiscount\"? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n\"prelaunchdiscount\" is used to give people a discount during the preconversion time frame, and after the currency is launched, the conversion price will be higher, depending on what percentage the discount was. It's a way to incentivize early adopters of your currency.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how do I use \"prelaunchdiscount\" when defining a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use \"prelaunchdiscount\" when defining a currency by including it as a property in the JSON object passed to the `definecurrency` command. For example:\n```json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{  \"name\":\"DiscountBrand\",  \"options\":33,  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],  \"initialsupply\":100,  \"prelaunchdiscount\":0.5 }'\n```\nThis would give people a 50% discount during the preconversion time frame, and after the currency is launched, the conversion price would be 50% higher.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question: what's the purpose of \"weights\" when defining a basket currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n\"weights\" is used to change the respective weights of the reserves in a basket currency. The total of all weights must equal 1, with a minimum of 0.1, since there can\u2019t be more than 10 reserve currencies in a basket currency. This allows you to customize the composition of your basket currency.\n\n**User:**\nThank you so much for your help! I think I have a better understanding of these concepts now.",

            "The recommended absolute limit for all currency supplies, including conversions and extended tail emissions for blockchains, is 10 billion (minus 1 satoshi) with 8 decimal places, which is 9999999999.99999999.",

Use this to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the rootID. After the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, a percentage of the reserves is taken and redirected to the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio, making the currency more volatile.Example currency: ``` json ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{  \"name\":\"BusinessBrand\",  \"options\":33,  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],  \"initialsupply\":100,  \"prelaunchcarveout\":0.1 }' ``` \u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called BusinessBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 BusinessBrand distributed among them. When the currency is launched, 10% VRSCTEST is taken out of the reserves, into the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio by 10%.### **\"prelaunchdiscount\"** Only works with basket currencies (`options:33`). Use this to give people a discount during the preconversion time frame. After the preconversion time frame and the currency is launched, the conversion price will be higher, depending on what percentage the discount was.When using this parameter, after the currency is launched, the reserve ratio will be lowered by the discounted percentage.Example currency: ``` json ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{  \"name\":\"DiscountBrand\",  \"options\":33,  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],  \"initialsupply\":100,  \"prelaunchdiscount\":0.5 }' ``` \u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called DiscountBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 DiscountBrand distributed among them. Immediately after the launch of the currency, when people want to convert, the price is 50% higher. Also, the reserve ratio is 50% lower because of the prelaunchdiscount.### **\"weights\"** Only works with basket currencies (`options:33`).
