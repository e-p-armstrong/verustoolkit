    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    What are the two types of addresses in Verus, and why is it important to understand
    their differences?


    **ANSWER:**

    In Verus, there are two types of addresses: public and private. Understanding
    the distinctions between public and private addresses is crucial for making informed
    decisions about transaction privacy.



    **QUESTION:**

    What are the different types of public addresses in Verus, and how are they derived?


    **ANSWER:**

    There are three types of public addresses in Verus:


    1. **R-address**: A public cryptocurrency address derived from a private key.
    The private key is essential for accessing and controlling the R-address.

    2. **VerusID@**: A public friendly-name cryptocurrency address controlled by a
    primary address, which is a R-address.

    3. **i-address**: A public cryptocurrency address derived from a VerusID.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the main difference between public and private addresses in terms of transaction
    visibility?


    **ANSWER:**

    Public addresses and their transactions are visible on blockchain explorers because
    they''re recorded on the public ledger. In contrast, private addresses and their
    transactions are confidential and do not appear on the blockchain or any explorer.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is a z-address, and how is it used for confidential exchange of funds and
    data?


    **ANSWER:**

    A z-address is a private cryptocurrency address derived from a private key. The
    private key is essential for accessing and controlling the z-address. Only the
    person who has the private key can spend and see its balance, or provide visibility
    in the balance through a viewing key. Z-addresses are used for confidential exchange
    of funds and data, as they do not appear on the blockchain or any explorer.



    **QUESTION:**

    Can a VerusID contain a pointer to a z-address, and how can coins be sent to it?


    **ANSWER:**

    Yes, a VerusID can contain a pointer to a z-address. Coins can be sent to it by
    using the format ``VerusID@:private``.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is an important limitation of z-addresses?


    **ANSWER:**

    Z-addresses can only contain the native blockchain currency. Simple token currencies
    or basket currencies cannot be held in a z-address.



    **QUESTION:**

    What are some common transaction scenarios in Verus, and how do they affect transaction
    visibility?


    **ANSWER:**

    There are two common transaction scenarios in Verus:


    1. **Public-to-public**: Transactions between public addresses (VerusID@, R-address,
    or i-address) are visible, with both sender and recipient addresses and amounts
    visible.

    2. **Public-to-private**: Transactions from public addresses to private addresses
    (z-address or VerusID@:private) are confidential, with only the sender''s address
    and amount sent visible, but not the recipient''s address or received amount.'
