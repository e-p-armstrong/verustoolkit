            "What is a basket currency in Verus, and how is it defined?",
            "A basket currency in Verus is a type of currency that allows for the creation of a new currency by combining existing currencies. It is defined using the `definecurrency` command with `options` set to 33. The definition includes the name of the currency, the currencies that make up the basket, initial contributions to the reserves, initial supply, and preallocations.",
            "Example currency: ``` json ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{  \"name\":\"CommunityBasket\",  \"options\":33,  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\",\"CoinCommunity\"],  \"initialcontributions\":[10,200],  \"initialsupply\":100,  \"preallocations\":[{\"Jane@\":100},{\"John@\":50}] }' ``` \u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called CommunityBasket. The launcher of the currency wanted to make initial contributions to its reserves. At the moment of broadcasting the currency to the network, there needed to be 210 VRSCTEST and 200 CoinCommunity in the rootID. The initial supply of 100 went to the rootID (if there weren\u2019t any more preconverters). At the same time of the launch, 100 CoinCommunity was minted into Jane@ and 50 into John@, this lowered the reserve ratio of the currency.### **\"initialsupply\"** A required parameter for basket currencies (`options:33`). This parameter does not work with simple token currencies. This is the initial supply during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People preconverting into the reserves receive from this initial supply.\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: `\"initialcontributions\"` and/or preconversions are required, otherwise the initial supply can not go anywhere and the currency is bricked.Immediately after the currency is launched, the supply can be larger due to `\"preallocations\"`.Example currency: ``` json ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{  \"name\":\"SocialBrand\",  \"options\":33, \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],  \"initialsupply\":500,  \"preallocations\":[{\"Max@\":1000}] }' ``` \u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called SocialBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves and in return they get 500 SocialBrand distributed among them. Immediately after launch Max@ receives 1000 SocialBrand, lowering the reserve ratio of the currency.### **\"preallocations\"** Use this parameter to receive a chosen amount of funds after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. Funds can be directed to VerusIDs and R-addresses. Works with simple token currencies and basket currencies.When using this parameter with basket currencies, after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, the reserve ratio is lowered. This is because new currency has been minted after the initial supply (`\"initialsupply\"`) is distributed, and nothing was new added into the reserves.",
