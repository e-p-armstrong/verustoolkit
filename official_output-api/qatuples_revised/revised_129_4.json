    "gettxoutproof [\"txid\",...] ( blockhash ) Returns a hex-encoded proof that \"txid\" was included in a block. NOTE: By default this function only works sometimes. This is when there is an unspent output in the utxo for this transaction. To make it always work, you need to maintain a transaction index, using the -txindex command line option or specify the block in which the transaction is included in manually (by blockhash). Return the raw transaction data. Arguments: 1. \"txids\"    (string) A json array of txids to filter   [    \"txid\"   (string) A transaction hash    ,...   ] 2. \"block hash\" (string, optional) If specified, looks for txid in the block with this hash Result: \"data\"      (string) A string that is a serialized, hex-encoded data for the proof.",
