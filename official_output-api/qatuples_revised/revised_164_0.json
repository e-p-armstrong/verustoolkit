    "What is the purpose of registering a name commitment in Verus, and how does it benefit the user?",
    "The purpose of registering a name commitment in Verus is to reserve a unique name for an identity without revealing the actual name. This allows the user to ensure that the name is available and prevents others from front-running the registration of the name. The name commitment also enables the user to specify a referral identity, parent name or ID, and source of funds, which helps to lower network costs and dictate issuance rules and pricing.",
    "registernamecommitment \"name\" \"controladdress\" (\"referralidentity\") (\"parentnameorid\") (\"sourceoffunds\")Registers a name commitment, which is required as a source for the name to be used when registering an identity. The name commitment hides the name itself while ensuring that the miner who mines in the registration cannot front-run the name unless they have also registered a name commitment for the same name or are willing to forfeit the offer of payment for the chance that a commitment made now will allow them to register the name in the future.Names must not have leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive spaces and must not include any of the following characters between parentheses (\\/:*?\"<>|@)Arguments \"name\"              (string, required) the unique name to commit to. creating a name commitment is not a registration, and if one is                            created for a name that exists, it may succeed, but will never be able to be used. \"controladdress\"         (address, required) address that will control this commitment.
