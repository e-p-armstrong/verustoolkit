    "The `getchaintxstats` command returns a JSON object containing the following information:\n\n1. `time` (numeric): The timestamp for the final block in the window in UNIX format.\n2. `txcount` (numeric): The total number of transactions in the chain up to that point.\n3. `window_final_block_hash` (string): The hash of the final block in the window.\n4. `window_block_count` (numeric): The size of the window in number of blocks.\n5. `window_tx_count` (numeric): The number of transactions in the window (only returned if `window_block_count` is > 0).\n6. `window_interval` (numeric): The elapsed time in the window in seconds (only returned if `window_block_count` is > 0).\n7. `txrate` (numeric): The average rate of transactions per second in the window (only returned if `window_interval` is > 0).",
