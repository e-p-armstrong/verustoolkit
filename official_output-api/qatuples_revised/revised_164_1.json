    "What are the required arguments for the `registernamecommitment` command, and what do they represent?",
    "The required arguments for the `registernamecommitment` command are:\n\n* `name`: The unique name to commit to.\n* `controladdress`: The address that will control this commitment.\n\nThese arguments are necessary to create a valid name commitment. The `controladdress` should be present in the current wallet that is registering the ID, and it may receive change.",
    "registernamecommitment \"name\" \"controladdress\" (\"referralidentity\") (\"parentnameorid\") (\"sourceoffunds\")Registers a name commitment, which is required as a source for the name to be used when registering an identity. The name commitment hides the name itself while ensuring that the miner who mines in the registration cannot front-run the name unless they have also registered a name commitment for the same name or are willing to forfeit the offer of payment for the chance that a commitment made now will allow them to register the name in the future.Names must not have leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive spaces and must not include any of the following characters between parentheses (\\/:*?\"<>|@)Arguments \"name\"              (string, required) the unique name to commit to. creating a name commitment is not a registration, and if one is                            created for a name that exists, it may succeed, but will never be able to be used. \"controladdress\"         (address, required) address that will control this commitment.
