    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `sendmany` command in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendmany` command in Verus is used to send multiple amounts of VRSC to multiple addresses in a single transaction. This can be very useful when you need to send different amounts to different recipients in a single transaction.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What are the required arguments for the `sendmany` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required arguments for the `sendmany` command are:\n\n1. \"fromaccount\" (string, required) - MUST be set to the empty string \"\" to represent the default account.\n2. \"amounts\" (string, required) - A json object with addresses and amounts.\n\nYou'll need to provide these two arguments to use the `sendmany` command.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the `minconf` argument? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `minconf` argument in the `sendmany` command is an optional argument that specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for the balance to be considered valid. If not specified, it defaults to 1. This allows you to set a minimum number of confirmations before the transaction is considered valid.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I add a comment to the transaction when using the `sendmany` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can specify a comment for the transaction by using the \"comment\" argument in the `sendmany` command. This argument is optional and can be used to add a note to the transaction. It's a great way to keep track of what the transaction is for.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the `subtractfeefromamount` argument? What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `subtractfeefromamount` argument in the `sendmany` command is an optional argument that specifies a list of addresses from which the transaction fee will be deducted equally. If not specified, the sender pays the fee. This allows you to split the transaction fee among multiple recipients.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the result of a successful `sendmany` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of a successful `sendmany` command is the transaction ID of the transaction created by the command. This transaction ID can be used to track the transaction and verify its status on the blockchain.",
