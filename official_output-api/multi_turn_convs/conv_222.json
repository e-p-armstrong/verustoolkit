    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been exploring the commands available in Verus, and I was wondering what the `z_listoperationids` command does.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_listoperationids` command returns a list of operation IDs currently known to the wallet. It can be used to retrieve a list of operation IDs, optionally filtered by their status. Do you have any other questions about this command, or would you like to know more about its usage?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! What arguments can be passed to the `z_listoperationids` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_listoperationids` command can take one optional argument, \"status\", which is a string used to filter the result by the operation's state. For example, you can filter by \"success\" to only show successful operations.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What is the format of the result returned by the `z_listoperationids` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `z_listoperationids` command is a JSON array of strings, where each string is an operation ID belonging to the wallet.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `z_listoperationids` command from the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_listoperationids` command from the command line by running `verus z_listoperationids`. This will return a list of operation IDs currently known to the wallet.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about using the `z_listoperationids` command with curl?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_listoperationids` command using curl by sending a JSON RPC request to the Verus daemon. The command would look like this:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_listoperationids\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nReplace `myusername` with your actual username and `curltest` with a unique ID for the request.",
