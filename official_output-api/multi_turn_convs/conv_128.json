    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was wondering about the `z_getoperationstatus` command. What's its purpose in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getoperationstatus` command is used to retrieve the status of one or more operations, along with any associated result or error data. The operation remains in memory after the command is executed. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What arguments does the `z_getoperationstatus` command take?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getoperationstatus` command takes a single optional argument: an array of operation IDs. If this argument is not provided, the command will examine all operations known to the node.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps. What's the format of the result returned by the `z_getoperationstatus` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `z_getoperationstatus` command is an array of JSON objects, each containing information about an operation's status and any associated result or error data.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `z_getoperationstatus` command using the Verus command-line interface?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_getoperationstatus` command using the Verus command-line interface by running the following command:\n\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus '[\"operationid\",... ]'\n```\n\nReplace `\"operationid\",...` with the actual operation IDs you want to query.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how can I use the `z_getoperationstatus` command using the Verus JSON-RPC interface?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_getoperationstatus` command using the Verus JSON-RPC interface by sending a JSON-RPC request to the Verus node. The request should have the following format:\n\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_getoperationstatus\", \"params\": ['[\"operationid\",... ]'] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\nReplace `\"operationid\",...` with the actual operation IDs you want to query, and `myusername` with your actual username.",
