    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you with Verus. Do you have any questions about using Verus or its commands?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm curious about the `listreceivedbyaccount` command. What's the purpose of it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listreceivedbyaccount` command lists the balances of accounts in Verus. It returns a list of objects, each containing information about an account, including the account name, the total amount received, and the number of confirmations of the most recent transaction. Do you have any other questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. What are the optional parameters for the `listreceivedbyaccount` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listreceivedbyaccount` command has three optional parameters:\n\n1. `minconf`: The minimum number of confirmations required for a payment to be included in the list. The default value is 1.\n2. `includeempty`: A boolean indicating whether to include accounts that haven't received any payments. The default value is false.\n3. `includeWatchonly`: A boolean indicating whether to include watchonly addresses in the list. The default value is false.\n\nDo you have any other questions about these parameters or how to use them?\n\n**User:**\nWhat information is included in the result of the `listreceivedbyaccount` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `listreceivedbyaccount` command is a list of objects, each containing the following information:\n\n1. `involvesWatchonly`: A boolean indicating whether imported addresses were involved in the transaction.\n2. `account`: The name of the receiving account.\n3. `amount`: The total amount received by addresses with this account.\n4. `confirmations`: The number of confirmations of the most recent transaction included.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the result or how to use the information it provides?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `listreceivedbyaccount` command to include accounts that haven't received any payments?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo include accounts that haven't received any payments, you can set the `includeempty` parameter to true. For example:\n```\nverus listreceivedbyaccount 6 true true\n```\nThis command will list the balances of all accounts, including those that haven't received any payments, with a minimum of 6 confirmations.",
