    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `fundrawtransaction` command in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `fundrawtransaction` command is used to add inputs to a transaction until it has enough value to meet its output value. It does not modify existing inputs and adds one change output to the outputs. It's a useful tool for preparing transactions for signing and sending.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps! What are the required arguments for the `fundrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required arguments for the `fundrawtransaction` command are:\n\n1. \"hexstring\" - The hex string of the raw transaction.\n\nThe other arguments are optional. Do you have any specific use case in mind where you'd like to use this command?\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the \"objectarray\" argument? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"objectarray\" argument is an optional UTXO list that specifies which UTXOs to select from for funding. It gives you more control over which specific inputs to use when funding the transaction.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about the \"changeaddress\" argument? What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"changeaddress\" argument is an optional string that specifies the address to send change to if there is any. This is useful if you want to specify a specific address to receive any change from the transaction.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What about the \"explicitfee\" argument? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"explicitfee\" argument is an optional number that specifies the fee to offer instead of the default fee, only when using a UTXO list. This allows you to customize the fee for the transaction.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the result of the `fundrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `fundrawtransaction` command is an object with three properties:\n\n1. \"hex\" - The resulting raw transaction (hex-encoded string)\n2. \"fee\" - The fee added to the transaction (numeric)\n3. \"changepos\" - The position of the added change output, or -1 (numeric)\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. Now, I'd like to know how to create a transaction with no inputs, add sufficient unsigned inputs to meet the output value, sign the transaction, and send the transaction using Verus commands.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo do that, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. `verus createrawtransaction \"[]\" \"{\\\"myaddress\\\":0.01}\"` to create a transaction with no inputs.\n2. `verus fundrawtransaction \"rawtransactionhex\"` to add sufficient unsigned inputs to meet the output value.\n3. `verus signrawtransaction \"fundedtransactionhex\"` to sign the transaction.\n4. `verus sendrawtransaction \"signedtransactionhex\"` to send the transaction.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create, fund, sign, and send a transaction using Verus commands.",
