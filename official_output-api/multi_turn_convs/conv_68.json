    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `verifytxoutproof` command in Verus. What is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifytxoutproof` command verifies that a proof points to a transaction in a block, returning the transaction it commits to and throwing an RPC error if the block is not in our best chain.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What is the required argument for the `verifytxoutproof` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required argument for the `verifytxoutproof` command is a string called \"proof\", which is a hex-encoded proof generated by `gettxoutproof`.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And what does the `verifytxoutproof` command return?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifytxoutproof` command returns an array of strings, which are the txid(s) that the proof commits to. If the proof is invalid, an empty array is returned.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if the block is not in our best chain when using the `verifytxoutproof` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the block is not in our best chain when using the `verifytxoutproof` command, an RPC error is thrown.",
