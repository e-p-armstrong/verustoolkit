    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `z_mergetoaddress` command in Verus, but I'm not really sure what it does. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_mergetoaddress` command is used to merge multiple UTXOs and notes into a single UTXO or note. It's a handy tool for consolidating your funds and making your wallet more organized.\n\n**User:**\nI've tried using it, but it's not working. I get an error saying it's disabled. Why is that, and how can I enable it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_mergetoaddress` command is currently disabled by default for security reasons. To enable it, you need to restart Verus with the `-experimentalfeatures` and `-zmergetoaddress` command-line options, or add the following lines to the Verus configuration file (`verus.conf`):\n```\nexperimentalfeatures=1\nzmergetoaddress=1\n```\nJust add those lines to your config file, and you should be good to go!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I've enabled it. What happens to protected coinbase UTXOs when I use the `z_mergetoaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_mergetoaddress` command ignores protected coinbase UTXOs. To combine those into a single note, you need to use the `z_shieldcoinbase` command instead.\n\n**User:**\nWhat if something goes wrong during the merge process? What happens to the UTXOs I selected?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf there is an error during the `z_mergetoaddress` operation, the UTXOs selected for merging will be unlocked. You can use the `listlockunspent` RPC call to return a list of locked UTXOs, so you can try again or handle them manually.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, is there a way to limit the number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging using the `z_mergetoaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can limit the number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging by setting the `transparent_limit` and `shielded_limit` parameters. If the `transparent_limit` parameter is set to zero, the number of UTXOs will be limited by the size of the transaction, or by the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option if Overwinter is not yet active.",
