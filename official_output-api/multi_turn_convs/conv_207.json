    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out this command `getlocalsolps` in Verus. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getlocalsolps` command returns the average local solutions per second since this node was started. This is the same information shown on the metrics screen (if enabled).\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. What's the format of the result returned by the `getlocalsolps` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `getlocalsolps` command is a numeric value in the format `xxx.xxxxx`, representing the average local solutions per second.\n\n**User:**\nAlright, got it! So, how can I actually use the `getlocalsolps` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getlocalsolps` command in Verus by running the following command in the terminal:\n\n```\n> verus getlocalsolps\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the command with the Verus JSON-RPC API by sending a request to `http://127.0.0.1:27486/` with the following JSON payload:\n\n```\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\",\n  \"id\": \"curltest\",\n  \"method\": \"getlocalsolps\",\n  \"params\": []\n}\n```\n\nYou can do this using the `curl` command:\n\n```\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getlocalsolps\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",
