    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to assist you with Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the `invalidateblock` command in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `invalidateblock` command is used to permanently mark a block as invalid, as if it had violated a consensus rule. Do you have any further questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What's the required argument for the `invalidateblock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required argument for the `invalidateblock` command is the hash of the block to be marked as invalid. You'll need to provide the actual hash of the block you want to invalidate.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So how do I use the `invalidateblock` command to mark a block as invalid?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `invalidateblock` command to mark a block as invalid by running the following command:\n\n```\nverus invalidateblock \"blockhash\"\n```\n\nReplace `\"blockhash\"` with the actual hash of the block you want to mark as invalid. Just run this command in your terminal, and you're good to go!\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. Can I also use the `invalidateblock` command with a JSON-RPC request?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use the `invalidateblock` command with a JSON-RPC request. Here's an example:\n\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"invalidateblock\", \"params\": [\"blockhash\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\nReplace `\"blockhash\"` with the actual hash of the block you want to mark as invalid, and `myusername` with your actual username. This way, you can use the `invalidateblock` command programmatically. Do you have any more questions about Verus or the `invalidateblock` command?",
