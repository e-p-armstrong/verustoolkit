    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind?\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to figure out some of the commands in Verus, and I'm not quite sure what `z_listunspent` does. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_listunspent` command returns an array of unspent shielded notes with between `minconf` and `maxconf` (inclusive) confirmations. It can also be used to filter notes sent to specific addresses. Do you want to know more about the arguments you can pass to this command?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that would be helpful. What are the arguments that can be passed to the `z_listunspent` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_listunspent` command takes four arguments:\n\n1. `minconf` (numeric, optional, default=1): The minimum confirmations to filter.\n2. `maxconf` (numeric, optional, default=9999999): The maximum confirmations to filter.\n3. `includeWatchonly` (bool, optional, default=false): A flag to include watchonly addresses.\n4. `\"addresses\"` (string): A JSON array of zaddrs (both Sprout and Sapling) to filter on.\n\nDo you have any questions about these arguments, or would you like to know more about the format of the result returned by this command?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. What is the format of the result returned by the `z_listunspent` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `z_listunspent` command is an array of JSON objects, each containing the following properties:\n\n* `txid` (string): The transaction ID.\n* `jsindex` (numeric, Sprout only): The joinsplit index.\n* `jsoutindex` (numeric, Sprout only): The output index of the joinsplit.\n* `outindex` (numeric, Sapling only): The output index.\n* `confirmations` (numeric): The number of confirmations.\n* `spendable` (boolean): True if the note can be spent by the wallet, false if the address is watchonly.\n* `address` (string): The shielded address.\n* `amount` (numeric): The amount of value in the note.\n* `memo` (string): A hexadecimal string representation of the memo field.\n* `change` (boolean): True if the address that received the note is also one of the sending addresses.\n\nDo you have any questions about these properties, or would you like to know more about the `includeWatchonly` argument?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I did have a question about the `includeWatchonly` argument. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `includeWatchonly` argument is a flag that, when set to `true`, includes watchonly addresses in the result. This means that notes sent to addresses that are watchonly (i.e., imported with `z_importviewingkey`) will also be included in the result.",
