    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with the Verus command line interface and I'm not sure about the purpose of the `resendwallettransactions` command. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `resendwallettransactions` command is intended for testing purposes only. It immediately re-broadcasts unconfirmed wallet transactions to all peers. Normally, the wallet code periodically re-broadcasts automatically, making this command unnecessary for regular use.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So what does the `resendwallettransactions` command return, exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `resendwallettransactions` command returns an array of transaction IDs that were re-broadcast.",
