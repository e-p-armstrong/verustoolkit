Instead, a better model for distributed storage would look something like the Interplanetary File System, or IPFS, which\nis a peer-to-peer file system based on the Kademlia [18]19 protocol in an implementation\nthat currently works well enough to use as storage for create/read/delete operations using\nhash commitments on the Verus blockchain to represent and index content.\nWhile we are evaluating the IPFS, we are also looking at other distributed hash table\nsolutions, such as Open DHT [26].

The mining competition serves to determine the amount of computing power a would-be attacker would have to control in order to mine blocks that were not earned according to the intended rules, execute transactions that might otherwise be rejected, and prevent certain transactions from executing altogether.
