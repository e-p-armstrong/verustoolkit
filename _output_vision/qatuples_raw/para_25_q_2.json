    "What is the initial expected application of Verus's content classification capability?",
    "The initial expected application is to classify non-intrinsic polls themselves, as well as relatively simple tasks such as identifying toxic comments, hate speech, or categories of information.",
    "While Verus is designed to provide invaluable tools to people across the world, any system\nwithout censorship will also inevitably allow the underbelly of humanity to show through.\nThat means that while we would want all people to participate, we recognize that in order\nfor that to provide the most positive experience for all participants, we must use the Verus\npoll system itself to recognize, rate, and classify the content on its network, enabling those\nwho provide such a service through participation in polls to earn, while enabling the selective\nfiltering of content based on value judgements and classification of honest populations.\nWhile we recognize that the best early use case for such capability is in rating and\nclassifying non-intrinsic polls themselves, the ability to classify content is a fundamental\nstrength that Verus will increasingly develop over time. At first, we expect such classification\nto be applied to relatively simple tasks for humans, such as identifying toxic comments, hate\nspeech, or categories of information. Even though these types of classification systems have\nlargely employed machine learning systems running against privately curated training data,\nour vision is for Verus content classification to enable people to earn, as they classify content\nbetter than any machine learning system, but in a way that can be followed by the best\nmachine learning algorithms, and generalized at scale.\n3.3.8Truth vs. Opinion",
