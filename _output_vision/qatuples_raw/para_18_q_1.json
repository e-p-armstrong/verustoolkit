    "How does Verus plan to ensure the security of its network, and what components will be used to achieve this?",
    "Verus plans to ensure the security of its network by combining multiple components, including Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Virtue, and the decentralized Proof of Work (dPoW) security of Komodo, which is notarized into the Bitcoin blockchain. This multi-layered approach aims to provide robust security and prevent potential attacks.",
    "exchange.\nThe Proof of Virtue model will effectively be a modified form of PoS that is not based\njust on monetary value, but also on long term measurement of contribution, which will affect\ntrustworthiness and earning power in the Verus network. The intent is to provide opportunities for more people to participate in the growth of a positive functioning network and\nto prevent potential attackers from being able to easily buy their way into an attack, adding\nyet another layer of security.\nWe expect to keep the PoW component as part of Verus security system for an indefinite\nperiod of time. We also expect to leverage the dPoW security of Komodo and its notarization\ninto the Bitcoin blockchain as well.\n\n3.3\n3.3.1\n\nPolls, Voting, and Elections\nThe Importance of Secure Polling\n\nA great deal of research has delved into the best way to achieve confidential, verifiable, and\ntransparent (CVT) elections electronically \u2013 with a few notable systems actually used in\nreal life situations. These attempts, however, have been plagued with significant limitations,\nlimitations that almost always risked either revealing the identity of a voter and thus eliminating confidentiality, or allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate voters, and put the\nvalidity of the vote into question [1].\nThis was shown in one of the first majorly adopted North American electronic voting\nsystems, the Diebold AccuVote TS, which was announced in the year 2000 [4], at a time\nwhen, as a result of the Florida 2000 presidential election, the general public began to\nrecognize numerous flaws in the widely-used punch card voting system [2]. Despite multiple\nstudies discussing electronic voting systems \u2013 studies which clearly warned of security risks\nsuch as insider threats, issues with auditing, and network vulnerabilities \u2013 by 2004, the\nAccuvote TS system was deployed for major political elections in 37 US states [2], r",
