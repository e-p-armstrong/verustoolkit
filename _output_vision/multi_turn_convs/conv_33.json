    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how the Verus system plans to select participants for various functions, such as polls.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus system plans to use randomized selection, similar to its Phase I PoS block validation system, for many of its functions. This will be achieved through the use of blockchain lotteries, which will provide a pseudo-random sampling method. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What's the principle behind Verus lotteries, regardless of the specific algorithm used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe principle behind Verus lotteries is that the blockchain is used as a random oracle, and it is assumed that the exact value of a specific block hash from a past block in the chain cannot be modified by a byzantine participant to weigh the odds in their favor. This ensures fairness and security in the lottery process.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what's the purpose of Verus lotteries, and how can they be used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus lotteries can be used for selection of participants in randomized polls and in other cases where pseudo-random sampling is desired. They provide a way to randomly select participants in a fair and secure manner, using the blockchain as a source of randomness. This can be useful in a variety of applications, such as decentralized governance and decision-making processes.",
