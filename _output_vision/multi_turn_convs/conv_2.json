    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about mobile support in Verus. What's the priority for mobile support in the Verus project, and what features are planned for the mobile experience?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMobile support is a high priority for Verus, and the planned mobile experience is intended to provide a convenient way for users to use, earn, and spend Verus in their daily lives. The mobile experience will function as a wallet, self-sovereign identity, and provide easy access to polling and earning applications. It will also serve as an extensible application browser, capable of supporting additional applications that leverage the Komodo or compatible ecosystems.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really cool! When can we expect the first mobile experiences to be ready, and what features will they include?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe first mobile experiences are not expected to be ready until the completion of the project's second phase at the earliest. Initially, these mobile experiences will not include support for private transactions, which are planned to be enabled as a foundation for confidential, mobile polling and communications in the future.\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the technical side of Verus. How did the Verus project decide to implement its technology, and what existing technologies will it leverage?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter researching various options, the Verus project decided to start building its technology as a friendly fork of Komodo and its asset chain technology. This approach allows Verus to both become a contributing member of and enhance and extend the Komodo platform as it builds its own blockchain platform technologies and real-world applications of PBaaS. Verus will leverage proven zk-SNARK zero-knowledge privacy technologies and Komodo's delayed proof of work (dPoW) to underpin its blockchain with a foundation of security and trust.",
