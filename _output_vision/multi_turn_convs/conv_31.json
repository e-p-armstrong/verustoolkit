    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading the Verus vision paper and I had some questions about the references cited in it. What is the topic of the paper by Gilad et al. (2017) cited in the Verus vision paper?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe paper by Gilad et al. (2017) is about scaling Byzantine agreements for cryptocurrencies, specifically discussing the Algorand protocol. Do you have any other questions about this paper or the Verus vision paper in general?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually I do. What is the topic of the paper by Klbl et al. (2016) cited in the Verus vision paper?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe paper by Klbl et al. (2016) is about efficient short-input hashing for post-quantum applications, specifically discussing Haraka v2. If you have any more questions about these papers or how they relate to Verus, feel free to ask!",
