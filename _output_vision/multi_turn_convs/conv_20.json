    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you understand more about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been wondering, how do lotteries work on the Verus network, considering it's a decentralized system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn the Verus network, lotteries are implemented in a decentralized manner. There is no central server selecting and sending messages to participants. To participate in a lottery or poll, you must first ensure you meet the requirements, then submit a transaction that proves your valid claim. This transaction will spend the output of the lottery ticket to your address, authorizing you to be a validator on the autochain for the poll. Do you have any further questions about how lotteries work on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, but what's the purpose of lotteries on the Verus network, and how can they be used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLotteries on the Verus network can be used to select subpopulations based on identity and claims people make about themselves or that others claim about them. These claims can be flexible and attested to by other identities. For example, a lottery may look for specific demographics, such as males between the ages of 18 to 25, which can be verified through strongly validated documents like passports or driver's licenses. This allows for a wide range of use cases, from selecting participants for medical trials to identifying eligible voters in an election.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. How can polls on the Verus network restrict voting and verification?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPolls on the Verus network can restrict voting and verification by requiring explicit authorization, often through physical means like mail to a physical address, in-person verification with a QR code, or electronically delivered transactions to a Verus wallet. This ensures that only eligible participants can vote in the poll, and helps prevent fraudulent activities.\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand. What is the relationship between lotteries and identity on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus system provides self-sovereign identity, which allows identities to make flexible claims and have them attested to by other identities. Lotteries on the Verus network can utilize these identity claims to select subpopulations and verify information, making them a powerful tool for various use cases. This integration of identity and lotteries enables a wide range of applications, from decentralized voting systems to targeted marketing campaigns.",

            "Since the Verus network is completely decentralized, all lotteries, including PoS, are potential,\nand there is no central server selecting and sending messages to those who qualified in a\nlottery. When lotteries are implemented as a general feature, if you would like to participate\nin any Verus lottery or poll that is distributing tickets via lottery, you must first determine\nthat you qualify for the poll\u2019s requirements. You will then need to submit a transaction that\nproves that you have a valid claim and spend the output transaction of the lottery ticket to\nyour address using that proof. By default, that spend will authorize you to be a validator\non the autochain for the poll you are participating in, by providing you with the currency\nof that poll.
