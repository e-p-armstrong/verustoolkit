    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help you understand Verus. Are you interested in learning more about the Verus vision paper?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been reading it, and I have a few questions. What should I keep in mind when reading the Verus vision paper, especially when it comes to forward-looking statements?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! When reading the Verus vision paper, it's essential to understand that forward-looking statements, such as predictions, plans, and estimates, are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements represent the project's judgment and expectation of the future, but actual results may differ materially. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, especially when making financial decisions, as they are subject to modification, update, or change for legitimate reasons. It's crucial to keep this in mind when interpreting the vision paper.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Are the Verus Core developers obligated to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to the forward-looking statements in the vision paper?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus Core developers are not obligated to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to the forward-looking statements in the vision paper in light of new information or future events. It's essential to understand this when reading the vision paper, as it's meant to provide a general overview of the project's goals and vision rather than a set of binding commitments. Do you have any more questions about the vision paper or Verus in general?",
