    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in understanding how Verus can be used for polling and asking questions of a population or subpopulation of people.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus can be used to post polls and ask almost any question of a population or subpopulation of people, receive an honest and verifiable answer, and still respect the privacy of the respondents. This is made possible by combining privacy, polls at scale, and identity. It's a powerful tool for understanding the opinions and beliefs of a group of people while protecting their individual privacy.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. What are some potential use cases for Verus polls?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome potential use cases for Verus polls include determining the accuracy of news online, for research, or even for political polling. The possibilities are vast, and I'm sure we'll see many innovative applications of Verus polls in the future.\n\n**User:**\nHow will Verus polls benefit society in the long run?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOver time, Verus polls will be combined with machine learning to enable all of us, as a society, to benefit directly from our collective intelligence without today\u2019s risks to our individual privacy. Verus will combine auditability and verifiability of transactions with the option of verified, confidential participation \u2013 meaning societies and organizations can directly understand what people think, feel, and believe, as populations \u2013 without taking control of their personal data or targeting some individuals, based on their answers or beliefs.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a really powerful tool for understanding human behavior and opinions. What is the ultimate vision for the Verus Project?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe ultimate vision for the Verus Project is to enable us all to directly participate in our own worldwide economy. Verus applications will enable any individual to speak up with the power of an authorized participant \u2013 and with the confidence of anonymity \u2013 to produce a verifiable, transparent, and honest flow of information throughout the globe. It will transform the way that anonymity functions in our current technological environment \u2013 prioritizing cooperation and providing the financial incentive for that cooperation to occur.",
