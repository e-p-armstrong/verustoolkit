            "Verus autochains are secure because they are layered over proof-of-work (PoW) and delayed proof-of-work (dPoW) security, all the way back to the real Bitcoin blockchain through Komodo. Additionally, the first layer of security is run by the actual voters themselves, providing unprecedented layered security both in the autochain and in delayed proof-of-work, leveraging the network with the most hash power in the world.",

            "What is the concept behind the scalability of Verus autochains?",
            "Each poll or decision-making process on a Verus autochain is conducted on its own automatically-created-and-validated blockchain, operating under its own visible validation rules. This allows for scalability, as each decision-making process is separate and independent, without affecting the overall performance of the network.",
