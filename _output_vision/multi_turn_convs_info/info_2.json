            "An accurate method of recognizing participants who are attempting to strengthen the system could both decrease the power consumption and ecological cost of blockchain systems. This is because such a method would allow for more trusted participants to be selected for validation, reducing the need for excessive energy consumption and ecological impact associated with Byzantine or average participants.",
