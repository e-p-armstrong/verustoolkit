            "In Phase Three, the focus is on improving mobile experiences, implementing the identity system, including support for strong, decentralized identity and attestations. This phase will also introduce optional KYC strong identities via notarization of identities and poll-based identity verification. Additionally, it will be the first phase to support Verus chain validation PoV enhanced PoS.",
