Verustoolkit is a fork of Augmentoolkit that takes any conceivable written information about the Verus project — websites, API documentation, the vision paper, and more — and turns it into conversation training data for an LLM.



Applied Augmentoolkit.

## Recommendation: when training on Verustoolkit data, use GaLore, NOT LoRAs
