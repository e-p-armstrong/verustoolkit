    "What is the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` API, and how does it work?",
    "The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. This API is used to find currencies that have a certain level of liquidity and can be converted to other currencies. For example, using the command `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
    "rk and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. ## Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**   The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'   ``` - **Time Delay:**   The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'   ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ## Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g. BTC ETH:**   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth   ```   Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.## Sending and Converting Currency **Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**",
