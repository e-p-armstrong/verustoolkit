    "## NEW 3D CROSS-CHAIN LIQUIDITY NETWORK VISUALIZER (GUI FOR TESTNET) In v0.9.2 Verus Desktop, there is a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on chain and cross-chain, with the ability to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions. To access the visualizer, click on \u201cVisualize Network\u201d on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop. If you\u2019re interested in seeing the visualizer now, here\u2019s a link directly to the visualizer as part of a recent video members of the community helped make (https://youtu.be/CkgUVjx_g1M?t=43).## NEW PBAAS CAPABILITIES All PBaaS capabilities, including for application development, are available now on the new Verus testnet. Our goal for interoperability on this new testnet is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge in the next couple days. Now would be a good time for development capable projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus\u2019s transformative technologies to do a deep dive on the Verus testnet. These new capabilities in v0.9.2, as well as all those we are familiar with, available nowhere else, will be on mainnet SOON(\u2122):",
