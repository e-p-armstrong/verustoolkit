    "What is the purpose of the Verus testnet?",
    "The Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network used for testing and hardening new Verus protocols before they are released on the mainnet. It allows users to try out new features and capabilities in a real-world environment, without affecting the mainnet. The testnet currencies and assets have no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet.",
    "## Verifying Downloads A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, is included for each download. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". 1) Extract downloaded archive 2) Verify signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. 3) Extract archive to desired directory ### CLI examples **Verifying file directly** ``` ./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AV6kEwABQR85s2Rs3BjLBikfd0gDQ3CeUxJwRDzx0Y+DocPn5SzWdxq6W45PVDVDFBRPUzKY48mC8krb/mNau66rXn4hDbb4 /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.2-6-amd64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.2-6-amd64.tar.gz ``` **Verifying using a checksum** ``` ./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AV6kEwABQR85s2Rs3BjLBikfd0gDQ3CeUxJwRDzx0Y+DocPn5SzWdxq6W45PVDVDFBRPUzKY48mC8krb/mNau66rXn4hDbb4 f20c5e9620b483721396485e8005b8ac64ed832d8a05c6b56665f0d5a3b584ca ```**The result will be true if the signature is valid.** ``` true ``` Announcing NON-MANDATORY CLI upgrade v0.7.2-5, with fixes that only apply to testnet. Mainnet features are unchanged from v0.7.2-4. This release includes the following improvements and updates: - Fix testnet transaction funding issue for multi-currency `sendcurrency` commands - Fix testnet currency conversions## The Verus DeFi Testnet -- THERE IS NO TESTNET RESET All new 'sendcurrency' features described above now work on both mainnet and testnet. In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well.This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever released, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it\u2019s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel.
