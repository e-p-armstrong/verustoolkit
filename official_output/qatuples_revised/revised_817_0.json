This release includes the following improvements and updates for testnet: - Add `getcurrencybalance` API to get multi-currency balances on transparent/private addresses and identities. - Optimize multi-currency operators and UTXO selection - Display unlocked balance in `getwalletinfo` - Add support for \"z*\" wildcard in `z_getbalance` ## The Verus DeFi Testnet -- THERE IS NO TESTNET RESET All new 'sendcurrency' features described above now work on both mainnet and testnet. In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well.",
