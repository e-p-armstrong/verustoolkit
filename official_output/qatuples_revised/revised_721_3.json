    "What are the optional arguments for the `getchaintxstats` command, and what do they do?",
    "The optional arguments for the `getchaintxstats` command are:\n\n1. `nblocks` - The number of blocks in the averaging window.\n2. `blockhash` - The hash of the block which ends the window.\n\nThese arguments allow you to specify the window of blocks for which you want to compute the transaction statistics.",
    "### `getchaintips` Return information about all known tips in the block tree, including the main chain as well as orphaned branches.#### Result: ```json [  {   \"height\": xxxx,     (numeric) height of the chain tip   \"hash\": \"xxxx\",     (string) block hash of the tip   \"branchlen\": 0     (numeric) zero for main chain   \"status\": \"active\"   (string) \"active\" for the main chain  },  {   \"height\": xxxx,   \"hash\": \"xxxx\",   \"branchlen\": 1     (numeric) length of branch connecting the tip to the main chain   \"status\": \"xxxx\"    (string) status of the chain (active, valid-fork, valid-headers, headers-only, invalid)  } ] ``` Possible values for status: 1. \"invalid\"        This branch contains at least one invalid block 2. \"headers-only\"     Not all blocks for this branch are available, but the headers are valid 3. \"valid-headers\"     All blocks are available for this branch, but they were never fully validated 4. \"valid-fork\"      This branch is not part of the active chain, but is fully validated 5. \"active\"        This is the tip of the active main chain, which is certainly validExamples: ```bash > verus getchaintips > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getchaintips\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/ ```### `getchaintxstats`Compute statistics about the total number and rate of transactions in the chain.#### Arguments: 1. nblocks  (numeric, optional) Number of blocks in averaging window. 2. blockhash (string, optional) The hash of the block which ends the window.#### Result: ```json {  \"time\": xxxxx,             (numeric) The timestamp for the final block in the window in UNIX format.  \"txcount\": xxxxx,           (numeric) The total number of transactions in the chain up to that point.  \"window_final_block_hash\": \"...\",   (string) The hash of the final block in the window.  \"window_block_count\": xxxxx,      (numeric) Size of the window in number of blocks.  \"window_tx_count\": xxxxx,       (numeric) The number of transactions in the window. Only returned if \"window_block_count\" is > 0.  \"window_interval\": xxxxx,       (numeric) The elapsed time in the window in seconds. Only returned if \"window_block_count\" is > 0.  \"txrate\": x.xx,            (numeric) The average rate of transactions per second in the window. Only returned if \"window_interval\" is > 0. } ```",
