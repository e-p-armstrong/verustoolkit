    "How do currency launches work in Version v0.7.1-5 of the TestNet protocols?",
    "Currency launches in Version v0.7.1-5 of the TestNet protocols feature a Kickstarter-like system, where there are minimums to activate or automatically refund if not met. The launch pricing is dynamic, based on participation, and there are pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations. All of these features can be specified in easy-to-understand commands and parameters, with no programming necessary.",
    "# Enhancements to TestNet Protocols for Increased Scale, Currency Burn Functions, and Centralized Fractional Currencies Version v0.7.1-5 is not yet considered hardened for mainnet, but has increased scale over previous versions in addition to the ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency. This allows price neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. This version also enables a new parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API called \"burn\". If \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent, which must be a token or fractional currency is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.# An end to front running Conversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.# The Best Way to Launch a Currency Currency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!",
