    "What is the purpose of a locked VerusID, and how does it provide protection against unauthorized access?",
    "A locked VerusID is designed to provide an additional layer of security and protection against unauthorized access. When a VerusID is locked, it can only be spent or accessed after a predetermined unlock time. This lock can be circumvented by the revocation and recovery authority identities, allowing them to revoke and recover the ID in case of an unauthorized unlock. This feature provides a decentralized solution to the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" and offers a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery.",
    "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.
