    "What are the benefits of decentralized cross-chain protocols in terms of decentralization and resistance to DoS attacks?",
    "Decentralized cross-chain protocols provide maximum decentralization and a high cost to launch a DoS attack, making it nearly impossible to do so over a significant length of time.",
    "with an in-secret 51% combined hash/stake attack could be prevented if we changed the protocol to first require posting the ready to finalize data and allow notaries who recognize that there is a signature on chain for something they don\u2019t agree with (likely stolen key), to simply revoke their identity, which will prevent that notarization from ever being confirmed. This same security feature is supported between all PBaaS chains and has been implemented in the Ethereum contracts for witnesses as well. This new protocol also provides for other types of evidence to prevent finalization, such as proof that there exists a more powerful (most power rule) tip than one witnessed. Enabling decentralized, cross-chain most power rules are an advance in cross-chain protocols that over time will strongly protect censorship resistance qualities of any multichain protocol.  - The above technology required changes to generalize evidence types between chains, enabling cryptographic enforcement that all notarizations are ultimately determined by miners and stakers and finalized by witnesses who must follow most power (stake+work) rules based on the protocol. Witnesses cannot finalize a chain tip unless alternating miners and stakers have posted 3 consecutive, agreeing, progressing cross-chain notarizations, without intervening disagreement, trading off more certain cross-chain transaction latency for on that depends on miners and stakers, meaning maximum decentralization and a high cost to DoS attack cross-chain, approaching impossible over any significant length of time. This approach makes the incentivized merge mining and bridge mining opportunities, as well as miner/staker participation, automatically part of and also critical to the cross-chain protocol. In v0.9.4, all users on the network may mine the Ethereum bridge via the bridgekeeper tool on the mining page in the GUI.  - With this new protocol, all PBaaS chains on testnet will consider witnessed / finalized tips final and will not unwind past those witness points or follow a chain that disagrees with a known finalized tip. When this protocol goes live on mainnet, and for any PBaaS chain whose community opts to use the Komodo notary service, Komodo notarizations will continue to ensure a stable chain tip, but no matter what other notarizations are present, PBaaS chains will always follow their proof of power protocol and lock to their witnessed tips as well.",
