    "How can I get a new shielded address for receiving payments using the Verus command line tool?",
    "You can get a new shielded address for receiving payments using the `z_getnewaddress` command. Here's an example:\n```\nverus z_getnewaddress\n```\nThis command returns a new Sapling address. You can also specify the type of address you want, such as \"sprout\" or \"sapling\":\n```\nverus z_getnewaddress sapling\n```",
    "Examples: ```bash > verus z_exportwallet \"test\" > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_exportwallet\", \"params\": [\"test\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/ ```### `z_getbalance \"address\" ( minconf )` Returns the balance of a taddr or zaddr belonging to the node's wallet.CAUTION: If the wallet has only an incoming viewing key for this address, then spends cannot be detected, and so the returned balance may be larger than the actual balance.#### Arguments: 1. \"address\"    (string) The selected address. It may be a transparent or private address and           include \"z\\*\" \"R\\*\" and \"i\\*\" wildcards.

One of [\"sprout\", \"sapling\"].#### Result: \"VRSC_address\"  (string) The new shielded address.Examples: ```bash > verus z_getnewaddress > verus z_getnewaddress sapling > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_getnewaddress\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/ ```### `z_getoperationresult '[\"operationid\", ... ]'` Retrieve the result and status of an operation which has finished, and then remove the operation from memory.#### Arguments: 1. \"operationid\"     (array, optional) A list of operation ids we are interested in. If not provided, examine all operations known to the node.#### Result: \"  [object, ...]\"   (array) A list of JSON objectsExamples: ```bash > verus z_getoperationresult '[\"operationid\", ... ]' > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_getoperationresult\", \"params\": ['[\"operationid\", ... ]'] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/ ```",
