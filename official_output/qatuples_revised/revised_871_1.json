    "Why might antivirus software flag this software as a potential threat?",
    "Antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky may flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program) because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and it is not a virus or malware.",
