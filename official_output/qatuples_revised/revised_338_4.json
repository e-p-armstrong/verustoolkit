    "The `subtractfeefromamount` argument is an optional parameter that allows you to specify a list of addresses from which the transaction fee will be deducted. If no addresses are specified, the sender pays the fee. If addresses are specified, the fee will be equally deducted from the amount sent to each of those addresses.",
