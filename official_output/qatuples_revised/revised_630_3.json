    "What is the purpose of the `checkifverusdisrunning.sh` script?",
    "The `checkifverusdisrunning.sh` script checks if the `verusd` daemon is running. If it has stopped, the script sends an email to the specified email address with a subject \"OUTAGE: Merry\" and a message \"Merry Miner Has Stopped Mining!!! HELP!!\".",
    "# Linux Bash Scripts To Make Mining Life Easier. Following are some bash scriptse to help make managing your Linux-based CLI miner a bit easier. Prereq is to install mailutils (postfix) and configure with your server's FQDN and set inet_interfaces=localhost in the postfix/main.cf file. ### Important General Information `VRSC Wallet & data location` on Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC` for wallet version prior to 0.5.7, replace verusd with komodod. ## Scripts: #### MINER SRVC MONITOR & ALERT IF DOWN Checks for the verusd daemon and if it has stopped emails you. ##### checkifverusdisrunning.sh ```bash #!/bin/bash if pgrep -x \"verusd\" > /dev/null then   TRUE=\"1\" else   echo \"Merry Miner Has Stopped Mining!!! HELP!!\" | mail -s \"OUTAGE: Merry\" -a \"From: user@yourqualifieddomain.tld\" you@youremail.tld fi ``` #### ALERT ON NEW BLOCKS MINED Prereq: Create a file called txHistory.txt and put 0 in it, saved to your home folder. The script then compares the current wallet TX count and compares to the txHistory file... so first run it will enter the right number in that file overwriting your 0. Only emails you if the number changes. ##### checkfornewblocks.sh ```bash #!/bin/bash historicalcount=$(cat /home/user/txHistory.txt) livecount=$(/home/user/verus-cli/verus getwalletinfo | grep txcount | sed 's/[^0-9]*//g') if (($livecount > $historicalcount)) then   echo $livecount > /home/user/txHistory.txt   echo \"Merry Miner Has Mined a Total of $livecount Blocks! Woot!\" | mail -s \"Merry's Blocks: $livecount\" -a \"From: user@yourqualifieddomain.tld\" you@youremail.tld else  NOCHANGE=\"1\" fi ``` #### WALLET BACKUP TO SECURED EMAIL (PROTONMAIL SUGGESTED) For this script I recommend setting up a new Protonmail account with no association to any other service or your name, 2FA secure it. #### Schedule script in CRONTAB In the following, the `*/5` is every 5 min, the `0` is on the hour every hour, the `0 12` is every day at 12 PM. ##### CRONTAB ```bash # m h dom mon dow  command */5 * * * * /home/user/checkfornewblocks.sh 0 * * * * /home/user/checkifverusdisrunning.sh 0 12 * * * /home/user/backupwallet.sh ``` Note: For any emails sent (for backup of dat file for example) make sure to enforce TLS security in postfix by adding the following line to your /etc/postfix/main.cf `smtp_tls_security_level=encrypt` (submitted by @J Oliver Westbrook) Note: last revision date 2021-03-09.",
