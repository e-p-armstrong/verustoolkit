    "How does the referral program incentivize mining and staking on the Verus network?",
    "The referral program incentivizes mining and staking on the Verus network by distributing a portion of the ID cost to miners and stakers. This can result in very high rewards for miners and stakers, especially during times when many new identities are being created. Since the rewards come from the on-chain economy, paid for by people buying identities, there is no inflation of the money supply.",
    "**Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.### A Built-in Decentralized Referral Program, Enabling Natural Growth.Verus IDs will cost Verus to acquire, 100 Verus per ID to be exact, which can be discounted to 80 Verus with referral of an existing Verus ID. The interesting twist is that all of the cost of an ID goes back into the network, either as referral fees, which are a way to get discounts or possibly even make money through referrals and built into the identity transactions themselves, or as mining and staking fees. No one besides people participating in the network as miners, stakers, or ID referrers take any proceeds from the cost of an identity. If you refer someone new and they purchase an ID with your ID as a referral, they will receive a 20% discount on the ID. In addition:1. You will receive 20 Verus directly 2. The person who referred you, if there is one, will receive 20 Verus 3. The person who referred person b, if there is one, will receive 20 Verus, and 3. The miner or staker will receive the remainder of the discounted 80 Verus costAs you might expect from looking at the fact that anywhere from 20 to 100 Verus goes to miners and stakers of Verus for each new identity once identities hit mainnet, some Verus blocks may have VERY high rewards for some time. The best thing about that is that regardless of how much the Verus blockchain rewards miners over and above the pre-determined coinbase reward, it will be as a result of the **on-chain economy**, paid for by people buying identities with **no inflation** of the money supply\\! If you or your friends missed the early days of the Verus launch, **you don't want to miss this** new opportunity to be mining, staking or referring now **Verus IDs are activated on the mainnet\\!**.## VerusPay#### Blockchain-integrated payment gateway for accepting Verus Coin (VRSC) in a WooCommerce ecommerce storeThis plugin extends *WooCommerce* on *Wordpress*, adding the ability to accept cryptocurrency payments in Verus Coin (VRSC) using either an on-store wallet daemon (best for VPS or dedicated hosting stores) or manually configured VRSC addresses (best for shared hosting stores).",
