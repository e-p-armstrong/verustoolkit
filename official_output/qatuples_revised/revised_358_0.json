    "How does the \"sendcurrency\" API work on the Verus Testnet?",
    "On the Verus Testnet, the \"sendcurrency\" API is enhanced with new multi-currency parameters. The first parameter, \"currency\":\"currencyname\", specifies the source currency of the send. The next parameter, \"convertto\":\"currencyname\", allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source.",
    "## Verifying Downloads A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, is included for each download. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". 1) Extract downloaded archive 2) Verify signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. 3) Extract archive to desired directory ### CLI examples **Verifying file directly** ``` ./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AQm0EAABQR8S/gEslZAXyvOmsbZ1iHKTDXFlABnJNPMCUXXNzwd57xW3IHjcumslSyi+JKkkhbWX6eXxkFcMICW8wQRE7i8k /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.1-1-amd64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.1-1-amd64.tar.gz ``` **Verifying using a checksum** ``` ./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" ATbAEAABQR/kpmoY0p915MY2NhXkl7O/wiDt/cjVfBKuvd0CdV5a4AFX5CnctBuOMEwCyiowyzYNPDanzSzE277ZDbMNH5We 95e70c52caeafffb0c9715aa28588068c9178c89fca2f60313074db052022a33 ```**The result will be true if the signature is valid.** ``` true ``` # Verus Testnet with Multi-currency Fractional Reserves and Currency Launch Protocol Verus multi-currency fractional reserve baskets are UTXO-based, fractional reserve currencies with anti-front running, simultaneously solved, provably fair liquidity system for all currencies and tokens in or imported into the PBaaS system.While Verus daemon v0.7.1 has minor improvements for mainnet operation, it offers full support for the new Verus Testnet multi-currency technology preview. On testnet, the new \"sendcurrency\" API, which is already available on Verus mainnet in its simplified form, is enhanced with new multi-currency parameters. The first parameter, \"currency\":\"currencyname\" - where the default on testnet for currency name is \"vrsctest\", specifies the source currency of the send. The next, \"convertto\":\"currencyname\", allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source.# An end to front running Conversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.",
