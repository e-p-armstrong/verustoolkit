    "What is the Verus public testnet and what features does it enable?",
    "The Verus public testnet is a technology preview that enables anyone to create new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. It allows for cross-chain currency conversion and sending currencies between chains, with a standard protocol fee of 0.01% that goes to miners and stakers of the network. The conversions are fully decentralized, and the protocol calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.",

Sending currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies is as easy as sending a cryptocurrency in less advanced systems today, except that the new Verus protocol enables you to include another blockchain as part of your destination and convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price along the way.
