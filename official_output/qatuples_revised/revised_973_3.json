    "What does the `OPTION_TOKEN` flag indicate about a chain?",
    "The `OPTION_TOKEN` flag, which is set to 0x20 (32 decimal), indicates that the chain is a token, rather than a native currency. This means that the chain is a tokenized asset that runs on top of another blockchain, rather than a standalone blockchain with its own native currency.",
