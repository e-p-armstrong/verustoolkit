    "Why do these error messages occur when running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution?",
    "These error messages occur because not all dependencies are installed by default on a Linux distribution, specifically the `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries.",
    "# error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory # error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory When running `./verusd` on a Linux distro (eg Debian or Devuan), not all dependencies may be installed by default, resulting in the errormessage `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` or `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory`. To solve this you need to install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries: `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev` Solution supplied by: Oink.vrsc@ Note: revision date 2021-12-01.",
