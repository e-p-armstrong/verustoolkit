    "How does Verus make it easy to launch a new currency?",
    "Verus makes it easy to launch a new currency by providing a Kickstarter-like system with minimums to activate or automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations. All of these features are specified in easy-to-understand commands and parameters, with no programming necessary.",
    "There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.# The Best Way to Launch a Currency Currency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!Currencies can be launched to accept a range of other currencies and with or without fractional reserve capabilities. Verus import/export protocol was designed to make integration with other block chains provable and easy, and there are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, where currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network, and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.# Preparing for Multi-chain, Dynamic Merge Mining While this 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology which was running on testnet last year. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies as well.## Sending and Converting Currency **Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**",
