    "Why does the import process take a long time to complete?",
    "The import process takes a long time to complete because it has to process a large number of transactions associated with the address being imported. This can be a time-consuming process, especially if the address has a high transaction volume.",
    "### The GUI wallet will not show any progress on the import and may give messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting. It will take quite some time for the process to finish in the background, especially if the address has many transaction on it. Information compiled by Oink.vrsc@. Note: revision date 2021-05-02.",
