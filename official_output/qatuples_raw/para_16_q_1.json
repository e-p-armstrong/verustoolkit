    "What are the benefits of having multiple primary addresses associated with a VerusID?",
    "Having multiple primary addresses associated with a VerusID makes it \"powerful\" because it allows for more flexibility and control over the identity. Specifically, any number of primary addresses can be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity, which is known as an N of M multisig control. This means that multiple parties can be involved in the decision-making process, and a certain number of them must agree before any changes can be made. Furthermore, the revocation authority and recovery authority can also be set up with their own N of M multisig controls, adding an extra layer of security and control.",
    "* Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available. * Powerful - Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of M multisig controls for its primary addresses.",
