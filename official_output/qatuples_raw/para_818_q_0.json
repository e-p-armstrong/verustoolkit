    "The primary use case of the Verus Vault feature is to timelock an ID, which prevents any spending of funds controlled by that ID while still allowing the ID and its funds to be used for staking.",
    "The Verus Vault use case, which was originally described in the conception of the feature, is the ability to timelock an ID, which would prevent any spending of any funds controlled by that ID, while still allowing the ID and all its funds to be used for staking. If the timelock was set for one day when locked, the unlock operation itself will require a waiting period of one day, which can only be circumvented by a revocation followed by recovery operation. In practice, this means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds (though they could stake them and delegate rewards to another address, which you could immediately see) unless they unlock the ID first and wait one day. If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone other than you, you can revoke and recover before any funds are lost at all. If you wanted to get extremely secure, to the point of covering a case where someone may steal your private keys without you knowing and then lay in wait until you unlock your identity, so they can pounce on your funds before you lock it again, you can actually modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it, which ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys. While we believe this unique Verus technology actually provides for fully theft-proof workflows and protection of all assets on the network under the control of an ID, we will generally refer to the technology as \"theft-resistant\" and disclaim all guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose as part of the \"experimental software\" disclaimer.In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.",
