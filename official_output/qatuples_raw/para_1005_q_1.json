However, editing the `VRSC.conf` can be done to achive our goal: * In the receive window of your wallet, click the hamburger (three vertical dots) next to the address you want to receive your rewards in and click `Copy Public Key`. * Close down Verus Desktop. * Edit `VRSC.conf`(see standard locations at the top) and add the line `pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED`. * Save and exit. * Start Verus Desktop as you normally do.## In Agama Wallet Step 1 - First get your wallet address you want to mine to: * If you don't have an address, click \"Receive\", click \"Get New Address\" and choose \"Transparent Address\" from the drop down.Step 2 - Next we need to retrieve our pubkey, * click on the hamburg next to the address that you want to receive the rewards in and click `copy pubkey`Step 3 - Set your PubKey * Go to 'Settings', 'App Config (config.json)' and enter your pubkey(THELONGSTRINGCOPIED) into the 'Pubkey VRSC mining key' field. * Click 'Save app config' to save these settings. * Restart Agama## In Verus CLI Step 1 - First get your wallet address you want to mine to: You can find an address if you already have previous transactions, or you can create a new one. To find an address from a previous transaction, use the command line verus listtransactions and copy the address found after \"address\". To generate a new wallet address, use the command line `verus getnewaddress` and a new address will be created.Step 2 - Next, using your new address, enter the command with verus-cli `verus validateaddress`. From the output find the long string after \"pubkey\", copy without the quotation marks.Step 3 - Set your PubKey * Option 1: use this pubkey when starting your daemon by adding the following line to the end of your command, just before the \"&\" sign: -pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED * Option 2: edit your `VRSC.conf` and add the line `pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED`. Then start your whallet as you are used to.",
