These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". 1) Extract downloaded archive 2) Verify signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. 3) Extract archive to desired directory ### CLI examples **Verifying file directly** ``` ./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AfmaIQABQR8yN3LyVymt/ZRYvyuGTma3rEbxFshyLOa3zI5qAXTaz34gxj30QXiluQ5TJJ7jxQwJaLUl6bJLMvfNvlzI+KBw\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.4-3-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.4-3-x86_64.tar.gz\" ``` **Verifying using a checksum** ``` ./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AfmaIQABQR8yN3LyVymt/ZRYvyuGTma3rEbxFshyLOa3zI5qAXTaz34gxj30QXiluQ5TJJ7jxQwJaLUl6bJLMvfNvlzI+KBw\" 7cea478ac61c8328fea9a42f8744f9112cf6723aa0f39c727c1d090f5daa5b34 ```**The result will be true if the signature is valid.** ``` true ``` Announcing v0.9.4-3, UNCHANGED FOR MAINNET -- MANDATORY FOR CONTINUED TESTNET USEThis release has no material mainnet changes.This release upgrades the testnet protocol to fix an issue with the Ethereum bridge and VRSCTEST mining and staking. Please update to v0.9.4-3 to continue mining and staking on testnet and the Ethereum bridge. This version also fixes an issue discovered when defining Ethereum NFT mapped tokens, which are not yet supported in the released Ethereum contracts, but are updated no in the daemon and ready to use when the contracts are upgraded, hopefully in the next few days.NFT mapped tokens will allow you to define an Ethereum NFT as the token that controls revoke and recover for an ID. Similar to how you can define a token for tokenized ID control, an NFT mapped token, when defined, refers by contract and tokenid to a specific NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Once defined as the currency for a specific ID or sub-ID and linked to the Ethereum NFT, that NFT will be able to be sent over from the Ethereum blockchain as a satoshi of that currency, sent to any address or ID on the Verus blockchain, exchanged trustlessly on the Verus on-chain P2P marketplace, and used to revoke and recover the ID which defined the token. Once the contracts are updated, you will be able to mint NFTs on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet, and endow your Ethereum NFTs with all of the power of your specially named VerusID. This new technology allows you to protect your NFTs with VerusID\u2019s revoke and recover technology, bind your NFT to the pseudonymous ID you use to log into applications, use it to extend and publish much more than just the NFT, and generally take your Ethereum NFTs to the next level!",
