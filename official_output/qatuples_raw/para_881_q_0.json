    "What is VerusHash 2.1, and how does it differ from VerusHash 2.0?",
    "VerusHash 2.1 is an updated version of the VerusHash algorithm, which is designed to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs on the Verus network. VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly reduce the dominance of FPGAs over CPUs, and VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which is expected to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still allowing FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications.",
    "# VerusHash 2.1 VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
