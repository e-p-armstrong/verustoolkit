    "What are the required arguments when registering a name commitment in Verus?",
    "When registering a name commitment in Verus, the required arguments are:\n1. \"name\" (string): The unique name to commit to.\n2. \"controladdress\" (address): The address that will control this commitment.",
    "### `registernamecommitment \"name\" \"controladdress\" (\"referralidentity\") (\"parentnameorid\") (\"sourceoffunds\")` Registers a name commitment, which is required as a source for the name to be used when registering an identity. The name commitment hides the name itself while ensuring that the miner who mines in the registration cannot front-run the name unless they have also registered a name commitment for the same name or are willing to forfeit the offer of payment for the chance that a commitment made now will allow them to register the name in the future.#### Arguments: ``` \"name\"              (string, required) the unique name to commit to. creating a name commitment is not a                            registration, and if one is created for a name that exists, it may                            succeed, but will never be able to be used. \"controladdress\"         (address, required) address that will control this commitment \"referralidentity\"        (identity, optional)friendly name or identity address that is provided as a referral mechanism and to lower network cost of the ID \"parentnameorid-pbaasonly\"    (currency, optional)friendly name or currency i-address, which will be the parent of this ID and dictate issuance rules & pricing \"sourceoffunds\"         (addressorid, optional) optional address to use for source of funds. if not specified, transparent wildcard \"*\" is used ``` #### Result: obj ```json {   \"txid\" : \"hexid\"   \"namereservation\" :   {     \"name\"  : \"namestr\",   (string) the unique name in this commitment     \"salt\"  : \"hexstr\",   (hex)  salt used to hide the commitment     \"referral\": \"identityaddress\", (base58) address of the referring identity if there is one     \"parent\" : \"namestr\",  (string) name of the parent if not Verus or Verus test     \"nameid\" : \"address\",  (base58) identity address for this identity if it is created   } } ``` Examples: ```bash > verus registernamecommitment \"name\" > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"registernamecommitment\", \"params\": [\"name\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/ ```",
