    "How do I calculate the average time to find one block using the formula?",
    "To calculate the average time to find one block, you need to plug in the values of NetworkHashrate, LocalHashrate, and BlockTime into the formula. For example, if the NetworkHashrate is 851125882237, your LocalHashrate is 46159950, and the BlockTime is 60 seconds, the calculation would be: `Average Time To Find One Block = (851125882237 / 46159950) * 60`. This would give you an average time to find one block of approximately 1,106,317 seconds, or around 13 days.",
    "[gimmick: math]() # Question: I'm mining since XYZ with XYZ, why I haven't found a block yet? $$ Average Time To Find One Block = ( \\frac{NetworkHashrate}{LocalHashrate} ) * BlockTime $$ One block = 6 coins (as now) NetworkHashrate = retrieved by `getmininginfo` command from </>CLI LocalHashrate = retrieved by `getmininginfo` command BlockTime = 60 seconds (average) note: The above formula assumes you are already mining and your hashrate is already included in the `NetworkHashrate`. For very large LocalHashrate calculations (what-if-I-had scenario) add it to the NetworkHashrate yourself. Real example with - 31 threads AMD Ryzen 5950x @ 4.4Ghz - $$ Average Time To Find One Block = ( \\frac{851125882237}{46159950} ) * 60 $$ $$ Average Time To Find One Block = 1,106,317 seconds (307 hours or little under 13 days) $$ Bear in mind that these are average times to find a block. In real life you may hit a block much sooner or later after finding the last. In the long run it averages out to the values predicted.
