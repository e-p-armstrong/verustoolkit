    "The minimum requirements for running a Verus Wallet on ARM devices include a 64-bit processor, a 64-bit operating system, 2 GB of memory plus 6 GB of swap space, 20 GB of storage space, internet connectivity, and the installation of `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries.",
    "# Hardware and Software requirement for ARM. There are minimum requirements on your hardware and software for running a Verus Wallet on ARM-devices. If your platform does not meet the minimum requirements, you may not be able to run the required software.The listed requirements are for running **one** chain. Additional PBaaS chains require more resources.## Verus Wallet on CLI#### Absolute minimum requirements: * 64-bit processor * 64-bit Operating system (Raspbian is standard 32 bit) * 2 GB memory + 6 GB Swap available to the CLI Wallet * 20 GB storage space for Verus Blockchain and CLI wallet * internet connectivity * `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries installed#### Recommended requirements * 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled * 64-bit Operation system (Raspbian is standard 32 bit) * 4 GB memory or more + 6 GB Swap available to the CLI Wallet * 50 GB storage on a *fast* medium (like NVMe device) for the Verus Blockchain & CLI wallet. This supplies room for blockchain growth over time and the ability to bootstrap the wallet. * internet connectivity * `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries installed## Verus Wallet on GUI #### Absolute minimum requirements: * 64-bit processor * 64-bit Operating system (Raspbian is standard 32 bit) with GUI interface * 2 GB memory + 8 GB Swap available to the Verus Desktop Wallet * 25 GB storage space for Verus Blockchain and Verus Desktop. * internet connectivity * `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries installed#### Recommended requirements * 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled * 64-bit Operation system (Raspbian is standard 32 bit) ) with GUI interface * 8 GB memory or more + 6 GB Swap available to the CLI Wallet * 50 GB storage on a *fast* medium (like NVMe device) for the Verus Blockchain & CLI wallet. This supplies room for blockchain growth over time and the ability to bootstrap the wallet. * internet connectivity * `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries installed## Staking #### Absolute minimum requirements: * All requirements to run a wallet#### Recommended requirements * All requirements to run a wallet * A fully configured and functioning NTP client, to keep your clock synchronized * Low latency internet connectivity## Solo Mining #### Absolute minimum requirements: * All requirements to run a wallet#### Recommended requirements * All requirements to run a wallet * 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled * Low latency internet connectivity",
