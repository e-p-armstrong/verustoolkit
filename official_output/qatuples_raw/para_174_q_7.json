    "What information is returned by the `mergefunds` command?",
    "The `mergefunds` command returns a JSON object with information about the merging operation, including the number of remaining UTXOs and notes, the value of remaining and merged UTXOs and notes, and an operation ID to track the status of the operation.",
    "#### Arguments: 1. fromaddresses     (array, required) A JSON array with addresses.             The following special strings are accepted inside the array:               - \"ANY_TADDR\":  Merge UTXOs from any t-addrs belonging to the wallet.               - \"ANY_SPROUT\": Merge notes from any Sprout zaddrs belonging to the wallet.               - \"ANY_SAPLING\": Merge notes from any Sapling zaddrs belonging to the wallet.             While it is possible to use a variety of different combinations of addresses and the above values,             it is not possible to send funds from both sprout and sapling addresses simultaneously. If a special             string is given, any given addresses of that type will be counted as duplicates and cause an error. ```json   [    \"address\"     (string) Can be a t-addr or a zaddr    ,...   ] ``` 2. \"toaddress\"      (string, required) The t-addr or zaddr to send the funds to. 3. fee          (numeric, optional, default=0.0001) The fee amount to attach to this transaction. 4. transparent_limit   (numeric, optional, default=50) Limit on the maximum number of UTXOs to merge. Set to 0 to use node option -mempooltxinputlimit (before Overwinter), or as many as will fit in the transaction (after Overwinter). 5. shielded_limit    (numeric, optional, default=20 Sprout or 200 Sapling Notes) Limit on the maximum number of notes to merge. Set to 0 to merge as many as will fit in the transaction. 6. \"memo\"        (string, optional) Encoded as hex. When toaddress is a zaddr, this will be stored in the memo field of the new note.#### Result: ```json {  \"remainingUTXOs\": xxx        (numeric) Number of UTXOs still available for merging.  \"remainingTransparentValue\": xxx  (numeric) Value of UTXOs still available for merging.  \"remainingNotes\": xxx        (numeric) Number of notes still available for merging.  \"remainingShieldedValue\": xxx    (numeric) Value of notes still available for merging.  \"mergingUTXOs\": xxx         (numeric) Number of UTXOs being merged.  \"mergingTransparentValue\": xxx   (numeric) Value of UTXOs being merged.  \"mergingNotes\": xxx         (numeric) Number of notes being merged.  \"mergingShieldedValue\": xxx     (numeric) Value of notes being merged.  \"opid\": xxx             (string) An operationid to pass to z_getoperationstatus to get the result of the operation. } ```",
