This token enables whoever holds it to have another level of revoke/recover power over the ID, in addition to the normal revocation and recovery authorities.\n3. API additions, including updateidentity, revokeidentity, and recoveryidentity.\n4. Continued hardening of the protocol and fixing issues with cross-chain currency definition import/export.\n5.

RC3 has some significant and important API additions, including the ability for any ID at all, even sub-IDs, to generate a single token as its currency. That token then enables whoever holds it to have another level of revoke/recover power over the ID, in addition to the normal revocation and recovery authorities, which also still work. This technology is now available in the pre-existing APIs, updateidentity (for changing revocation / recovery authorities), revokeidentity, and recoveryidentity. Please see help for details.In addition, we have continued to harden the protocol and fixed issues with cross-chain currency definition import/export and the new ability to burn reserves into a liquidity basket that were reported in the current testnet.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. Drop by pbaas-development to start building your vision on Verus while helping get PBaaS ready for mainnet!### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT): The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0. ``` verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}' ```",
