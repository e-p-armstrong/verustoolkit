    "Why might my antivirus software flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?",
    "Antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. These warnings are false positives and are intended to alert you that you are installing mining software.",
