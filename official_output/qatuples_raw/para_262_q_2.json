    "How can I verify the integrity of a downloaded Verus package?",
    "To verify the integrity of a downloaded Verus package, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the signature. For example:\n\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"Ad+PJgABQR9Zgmo5lAenuOeur65N/uzpvHTnirNh7zZ5bp2jGAfDVWT0FlZEo3TjklPzhSG8rYq1yQLQ/lCIsQaWcIF19TBB\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v1.0.1-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v1.0.1-x86_64.tar.gz\"\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"Ad+PJgABQR9Zgmo5lAenuOeur65N/uzpvHTnirNh7zZ5bp2jGAfDVWT0FlZEo3TjklPzhSG8rYq1yQLQ/lCIsQaWcIF19TBB\" 7ebad8a3636a06159fd33a91c25c98538f01afcf44824a9c85fccfadd61b0c4a\n```\n\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.",
