    "What should I do if I miss the fork for a new version of Verus?",
    "If you miss the fork for a new version of Verus, you can get back on the correct chain by stopping Verus and deleting everything other than your `wallet.dat` file in your data directory. The data directory locations are:\n\n* Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`\n* Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest`\n\nThen, you can restart Verus and it should sync with the correct chain.",

This release both fixes the remaining known bridge issues and adds security to ensure that you don't send to an unspendable address on any network by using the wrong format for a destination.The good news is that throughout the whole process of this first bridge release on testnet, we've been able to update through the issues we've seen without a reset and have not lost a single satoshi of test funds (which is not to say it is fully hardened quite yet). At this point, we hope and believe that this is the last update in this round of testnet, which will allow us to get back to focusing on the mainnet release and not asking those testing to update until we are very close to a mainnet release.Once more, we will ask that you shut down the old version now, and we will restart the notarizations and transaction flow between Ethereum and Verus at 5 AM UTC time.Thank you to everyone who helped with all the testing and exposing of issues that enabled us to make maybe even inconveniently quick progress.If you miss the fork for this version at the above time you can get back on the correct chain by stopping Verus and deleting deleting everything other than your wallet.dat file in your data directory at: - Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest` - Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` - Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest`",
