    "What was the purpose of launching a token on the old testnet and exporting it to Ethereum's Goerli?",
    "The purpose of launching a token on the old testnet and exporting it to Ethereum's Goerli was to create a DAI proxy/simulant that could be used on the new testnet. This was done because the Verus team wants to use only decentralized currencies in the live mainnet bridge.",
    "4) **Permissionless Chain, Token, and Liquidity Basket Currency Launches**: Whether you are looking to crowdfund an effort in a manner much like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, sell identities to which you expect to add value or that are sub-IDs of a very cool root ID, or launch an entirely new blockchain economy and blockchain that starts with all of the Verus technology and a bridge to Verus and Ethereum from day 1, Verus is probably the best platform for you. In fact, as we were planning for the next testnet and wanted to have our own version of DAI to use in the bridge, since we want only decentralized currencies in the live mainnet bridge, we used a command to launch a token on the old testnet, exported it and all its supply to Ethereum\u2019s Goerli on the existing bridge, and that will be the DAI proxy/simulant that we will use on the new testnet. It saved us all some time, proving that Verus PBaaS will also be the easiest, most efficient way to launch even an Ethereum ERC20, whether that ERC20 represents a token, DeFi basket, or even another PBaaS blockchain \ud83d\ude42",
