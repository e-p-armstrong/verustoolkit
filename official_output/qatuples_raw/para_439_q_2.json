    "How can I verify the signature of a downloaded Verus package using a checksum?",
    "You can verify the signature of a downloaded Verus package using the `verifyhash` command. Here's an example:\n\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"signature\" \"checksum\"\n```\n\nReplace \"signature\" with the actual signature from the txt file, and \"checksum\" with the actual checksum of the downloaded package.",
    "## Verifying Downloads A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, is included for each download. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". 1) Extract downloaded archive 2) Verify signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. 3) Extract archive to desired directory ### CLI examples **Verifying file directly** ``` ./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AZHCIQABQSBJ+t3wHNYyoWu42QrK3ncJKPdppvC2shhwDlPPR/ZKCwvu+Y8LEy8F/Wyj23ba9grVsJZQu4BCHDicQny6vIjt\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.4-3-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.4-3-x86_64.tar.gz\" ``` **Verifying using a checksum** ``` ./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AZHCIQABQSBJ+t3wHNYyoWu42QrK3ncJKPdppvC2shhwDlPPR/ZKCwvu+Y8LEy8F/Wyj23ba9grVsJZQu4BCHDicQny6vIjt\" 413bf64c365c3fcf92c273d1a8674626284e340437fc0634872b9d0ee483f327 ```**The result will be true if the signature is valid.** ``` true ``` Announcing v0.9.4-4, UNCHANGED FOR MAINNET -- RECOMMENDED FOR CONTINUED TESTNET USE, MANDATORY FOR CONTINUED TESTNET MERGE OR BRIDGE MININGThis release has no material mainnet changes.This release primarily upgrades the ETH bridge and also fixes a PBaaS cross-chain notarization issue that made miners and stakers consider themselves ineligible to enter cross-chain notarizations. There are no actual protocol changes.The ETH bridge upgrade introduces the ability to enter notarizations between Ethereum Goerli and VRSCTEST using bridgekeeper without an Ethereum private key in your conf file. This will enable you to still mine and potentially earn by agreeing or disagreeing with notarizations mined into the Verus blockchain, without needing to make transactions on or spend Ethereum for fees. This should also work with a free Infura account.As a reminder, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services , using your metamask, converting or sending cross chain through the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release.
