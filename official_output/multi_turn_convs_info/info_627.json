            "Why might antivirus software like Avast or Kaspersky flag Verus software as a potential threat?",
            "Antivirus software might flag Verus software as a potential threat because it contains mining software, which could be used by a third party to exploit your PC. However, Verus software is not malicious, and these warnings are false positives.",
            "Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". These are warnings that you are installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC.

A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables.
