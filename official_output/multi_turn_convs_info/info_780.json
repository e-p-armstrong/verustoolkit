            "Verus Vault is a capability that provides advanced time locking of identities, enabling a theft-resistant workflow of identity management. It also enables various use cases, such as trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, estate planning, and more. When combined with the revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID, the ramifications of Verus Vault are immense.",

In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities On the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",

            "How does Verus Fee Pooling technology differ from traditional fee models, and what are its benefits?",
            "Verus Fee Pooling technology differs from traditional fee models in that it smooths fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, rather than having them compete for individual block fees. This approach addresses concerns about blockchain security, such as those expressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0, by preserving the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees while ensuring a more stable and sustainable revenue stream for miners and stakers.",
