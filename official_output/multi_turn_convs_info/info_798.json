            "When a currency is launched in Verus, it is initiated at 50 blocks from when the launch transaction was made (default). The launch requires at least 10 VRSCTEST to be funded to the identity of the currency, and a certain amount of VRSCTEST (in this case, 1000) to be preconverted at a specific rate (in this case, 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD). The mining process earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new currency.",

I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
