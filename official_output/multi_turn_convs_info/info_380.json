            "The launch of a new blockchain with a bridge converter liquidity pool in Verus allows for the creation of a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. This means that the bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but are bound to the launch of the new blockchain and run on the new blockchain. All fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain.",
