            "To import multiple WIFs in one batch for public (transparent) addresses, go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner, and enter the following command for every WIF except for the final one:\n```\nrun importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" false\n```\nImport the final WIF with this command:\n```\nrun importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" true\n```\nThe last command triggers the chain to rescan all addresses in your wallet, including all the addresses you just imported. Replace `<wif>` with the actual WIF you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier. Note that the GUI wallet may not show any progress on the import and may give messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting. It will take quite some time for the process to finish in the background, especially if the address has many transactions on it.",
