            "VerusID is a system that enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. This means that users have complete control over their identities and can revoke or recover them as needed.",

            "How can I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the testnet and mainnet using Verus?",
            "To sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the testnet and mainnet using Verus, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\n2. Get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency` and use it to get the raw hex transaction data with:\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it with:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```",
