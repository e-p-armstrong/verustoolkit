Rewards for bridgekeeping are delivered both on Verus and on the Ethereum blockchain. Access the Ethereum bridge website (https://ethtest.verus.services) to move over some Goerli Ethereum or USDC, and participate in the Bridge.vETH liquidity basket launch to hold and earn fees on a basket with vETH, USDC, and VRSCTEST used as the fee converter for all cross chain transactions between Ethereum\u2019s Goerli and VRSC testnets.",
