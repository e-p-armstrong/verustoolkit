            "What limitations should I be aware of when working with multi-currency support in Verus?",
            "There are two limitations to be aware of:\n\n1. You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used.\n2. In the GUI, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.",
