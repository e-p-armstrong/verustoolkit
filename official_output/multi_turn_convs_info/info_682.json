            "The `timelock` parameter serves two purposes when updating an identity in Verus:\n\n1. **Time Lock:** It defines the unlock height of the identity, specifying the block height at which the identity will be unlocked.\n2. **Time Delay:** It defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.",

There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. ## Locking and Unlocking IDs - **Time Lock:**   The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'   ``` - **Time Delay:**   The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.   ```   verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'   ``` - Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. - A locked identity cannot revoke itself. ## Conversion Queries The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves - **E.g.

            "What is the concept of blockchain interoperability in the Verus network, and how does it work?",
            "In the Verus network, blockchain interoperability allows for multiple blockchains to operate and interact with each other simultaneously, without any limits on the number of blockchains. This is achieved through a fractal model, where each blockchain can interoperate with others, enabling seamless transfer of assets and data between them. While there is some overhead for cross-notarization, the Verus network allows for unlimited, simultaneous, and interoperable blockchains.",
