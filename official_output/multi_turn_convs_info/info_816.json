            "What is meant by \"private\" in the context of VerusIDs, and what features do they have?",
            "In the context of VerusIDs, \"private\" refers to the fact that each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, which can be used to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when available.",
            "- **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available. # VerusHash 2.1 VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network. # DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.

            "What is VerusHash, and what is its purpose?",
            "VerusHash is a hash algorithm developed by Verus. Its purpose is to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs on the Verus network. The goal is to prevent FPGAs from dominating CPUs in terms of performance, and to ensure that both types of hardware can operate efficiently on the network.",
