    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in VerusIDs. What features do they have in terms of revocation and recovery?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs are revocable and recoverable. Each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and can revoke the identity, effectively freezing its funds. Additionally, each ID includes a separate recovery authority, which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and recovery state. This gives you more control over your identity and funds.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\" on the Verus network. What does that mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs are quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses, meaning they are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs themselves are resistant to quantum attacks. Additionally, a quantum secure signature scheme is being integrated, which will allow for retroactive quantum resistance of funds sent to an ID when changed. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**User:**\nHow do Verus IDs enable decentralization and self-sovereignty?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs are fully decentralized, allowing anyone to create one without permission. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers, giving users complete, self-sovereign control over their identity. This means you have full control over your digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is a Verus ID, and how does it differ from other blockchain ID implementations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA Verus ID is a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides opportunities for identity applications. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol, giving users complete control over their identity. This means you're in charge of your identity, not some central authority.\n\n**User:**\nWhat benefits do Verus IDs offer in terms of sending and receiving funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If the controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. This allows for more flexibility and control over your funds. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs?",
