    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm thinking of using Verus Desktop, but I want to know more about it. What kind of software is Verus Desktop, and what are the risks associated with using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Desktop is experimental and unfinished software, which means it may not be fully tested or reliable. Using it comes with risks, and there is no warranty for any kind of damage it may cause. You use it at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds a bit concerning. What are the conditions for using, copying, modifying, or distributing this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPermission is granted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of this software, as long as the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that I need to update to a specific version of the Verus CLI or GUI wallet. What's the significance of updating to version 0.5.9 or later?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUpdating to version 0.5.9 or later is considered critical because it fixes a Zcash protocol issue described in the security announcement. It is recommended that all users upgrade to this version immediately and discontinue use of previous wallets.\n\n**User:**\nI think I might have used an older version before. What do I need to do if I have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to 0.5.9?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to 0.5.9, you need to delete the following directories before running the new update: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest` on Linux.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What kind of warranty or liability does the software provider offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that some antivirus software might flag this software as suspicious. Why might some antivirus software flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program) because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC. This is a false positive warning.",
