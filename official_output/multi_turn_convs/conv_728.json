    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with creating currencies from IDs in Verus, but I ran into an issue. What's a limitation when creating a currency from an ID in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But why is it not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt is not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name because it will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (in many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. I've also been trying to create a PBaaS chain using the Verus Desktop GUI. What's a limitation I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the heads up. One more thing, what's the disclaimer regarding the use of Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer states that the software is experimental and unfinished, and that users use it at their own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.",
