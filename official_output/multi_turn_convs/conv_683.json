    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand the Verus protocol. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the security of the protocol. How does the new protocol ensure that all notarizations are ultimately determined by miners and stakers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new protocol ensures that all notarizations are ultimately determined by miners and stakers by requiring witnesses to follow the most power (stake+work) rules based on the protocol. Witnesses cannot finalize a chain tip unless alternating miners and stakers have posted 3 consecutive, agreeing, progressing cross-chain notarizations without intervening disagreement. This ensures that the power of miners and stakers is what drives the notarization process.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Another security concern I have is about 51% attacks. What is the main security feature that has been implemented to prevent 51% combined hash/stake attacks on PBaaS chains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main security feature implemented to prevent 51% combined hash/stake attacks is the ability of notaries to revoke their identity if they recognize a signature on the chain that they don't agree with, which would prevent the notarization from being confirmed. This adds an extra layer of security to prevent malicious actors from manipulating the chain.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about Komodo notarizations. What is the role of Komodo notarizations in ensuring a stable chain tip for PBaaS chains that opt to use the Komodo notary service?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nKomodo notarizations continue to ensure a stable chain tip for PBaaS chains that opt to use the Komodo notary service. However, PBaaS chains will always follow their proof of power protocol and lock to their witnessed tips as well, regardless of other notarizations present. This ensures that the chain tip is stable and secure.\n\n**User:**\nHow do PBaaS chains on testnet handle witnessed and finalized tips with the new protocol for blockchain synchronization?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith this new protocol, all PBaaS chains on testnet consider witnessed and finalized tips as final and will not unwind past those witness points or follow a chain that disagrees with a known finalized tip. This ensures that the chain remains stable and consistent.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I'd like to know more about the benefits of decentralized cross-chain protocols. What are the benefits in terms of decentralization and resistance to DoS attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDecentralized cross-chain protocols provide maximum decentralization and a high cost to launch a DoS attack, making it nearly impossible to do so over a significant length of time. This ensures that the protocol is highly resistant to attacks and remains decentralized, which is essential for a secure and trustworthy blockchain ecosystem.",
