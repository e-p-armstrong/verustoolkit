    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been using Verus for a while, and I'm wondering if there's anything I need to do since I've used Testnet with older versions.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have used Testnet with Verus versions prior to v0.9.2, it is essential to delete and clear any existing Testnet data folders before using v0.9.2. This will ensure a smooth transition and prevent any potential issues.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What's the current status of the Verus network, PBaaS, VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAs of v0.9.2, the Verus network, PBaaS, VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols are considered feature complete for the upcoming mainnet PBaaS upgrade. The focus now shifts to protocol hardening, enabling usage, and improving the user experience.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds promising. What's new in Verus Desktop v0.9.2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus Desktop v0.9.2, there is a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer that shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on-chain and cross-chain. This visualizer can be accessed by clicking on \u201cVisualize Network\u201d on the Metaverse tab. It's a great way to get a better understanding of the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about PBaaS, but I'm not sure what's available on the testnet. Can you tell me more?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll PBaaS capabilities, including those for application development, are now available on the new Verus testnet. The goal is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge soon, and development teams can start exploring the Verus testnet to get a head start on using Verus's transformative technologies.",
