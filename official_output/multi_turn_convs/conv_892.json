    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent using the `registernamecommitment` command. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `registernamecommitment` command now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. You can use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr \"\" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny\n```\nThis command specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc, but no referrer. You can also use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration. Did that help?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that was helpful, thanks! I've been testing some things out, and now I want to reset my Verus testnet. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your Verus testnet, follow these steps:\n\n1. Close Verus and ensure that no testnet daemon is running.\n2. Delete the following directories:\n   - Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`\n   - Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest`\n   - Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`\n3. Restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native).\n\nThat should reset your Verus testnet. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the launch of PBaaS on the Verus testnet. How can I participate in that without any actual costs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo participate in the launch of PBaaS on the Verus testnet without any actual costs, you can join the #pbaas-development channel and act as a testnet liquidity provider. This will allow you to test the features of PBaaS, launch your own currencies, or start your exclusive ID-restricted club, governance group, or business without incurring any actual costs.",
