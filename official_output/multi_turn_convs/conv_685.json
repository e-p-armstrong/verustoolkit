    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you understand Verus and its features. Do you have any questions about VerusIDs or decentralized currencies?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm curious about the ID registration fee for fully decentralized fractional currencies. What happens to it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFor fully decentralized fractional currencies, the ID registration fee is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, which reduces the supply and raises the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves. The minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about ID registration fees?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. How can fractional and centralized currencies with a `proofprotocol` of 2 issue IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFractional and centralized currencies with a `proofprotocol` of 2 can issue IDs as a decentralized operation. They can also sell IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, and permission from the currency identity required. This allows for a more flexible and decentralized way of issuing IDs.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What are the limitations of IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies compared to Native IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, unlike Native IDs, which are registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent. However, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies are still valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs, as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Can ID registration fees be reduced for fractional and centralized currencies, and if so, how?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, ID registration fees can be reduced for fractional and centralized currencies. This can be achieved through referral support, which means that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred, and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies or sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. Is there an exception to the rule that IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot create currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is an exception. *.veth gateway IDs, which are available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter, will be able to create Ethereum-mapped currencies. Registration of.veth IDs will be priced at a level to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.",
