    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to unshield my coin rewards and get them staking on the CLI. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo unshield your coin rewards and get them staking on the CLI, follow these steps:\n\n1. Run `./verus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\"` to capture all coinbases.\n2. Wait for 100 blocks (minutes) for the transaction to be confirmed.\n3. Run `./verus z_getbalance <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks>` to check the balance of your private address.\n4. Run `./verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> '[{\"address\":\"<my_transparent_address>\",\"amount\":<95.9998>}]'` to send the coins to a transparent address, subtracting the 0.0001 VRSC fee from the balance.\n5. Run `./verus z_gettotalbalance` to verify the transaction after a few minutes.\n\nNote: You need to replace `<my_private_address_without_quotationmarks>` and `<my_transparent_address>` with your actual addresses, and `<95.9998>` with the actual amount minus the 0.0001 VRSC fee.\n\nDo you have any questions about these steps, or would you like me to explain any of them further?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what's the purpose of the `z_getbalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getbalance` command is used to check the balance of a private address. In the context of unshielding coin rewards and getting them staking, it is used to subtract the 0.0001 VRSC fee from the balance before sending the coins to a transparent address. Does that make sense? \n\n**User:**\nWhat about the `z_shieldcoinbase \"*\"` command? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_shieldcoinbase \"*\"` command is used to capture all coinbases, which are mined coins that are not yet staking. You need to wait 100 blocks (minutes) after receiving them before being able to move them. \n\n**User:**\nI'm using Windows. When I enter Verus commands on the Windows command prompt, they don't seem to work. The commands are shown in Linux/MacOS format. How do I enter them correctly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using the Windows command prompt, you need to substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character, and substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters. Additionally, omit the preceding `./`. For example, the Linux command `./verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> '[{\"address\":\"<my_transparent_address>\",\"amount\":<95.9998>}]'` would become `verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> \"[{\\\"address\\\":\\\"<my_transparent_address>\\\",\\\"amount\\\":<95.9998>}]\"` on the Windows command prompt. Does that help?",
