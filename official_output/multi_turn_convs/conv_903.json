    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Do you have something specific in mind?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was wondering about using open-source software. What kind of conditions must be met when using or distributing it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using or distributing open-source software, the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. That's a key condition to keep in mind.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also heard that some antivirus software might flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, might flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC. That's why they might raise a flag, even if the software is legitimate.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. Where can I find more information about these false positive warnings from antivirus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about the false positive warnings from antivirus software by reviewing the following resources: https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/ and https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/. Those should give you a better understanding of what's going on.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What kind of warranty or liability does the software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software. It's important to understand that you're using the software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nLastly, what kind of permissions are granted to users of the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPermission is granted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, without restriction. This includes the right to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so. So, you have a lot of freedom to use and adapt the software as needed.",
