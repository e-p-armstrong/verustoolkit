    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been learning about VerusIDs, and I'm curious about how they work with funds. What advantages do VerusIDs offer in terms of controlling and managing funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs offer several advantages in terms of controlling and managing funds. They can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If the controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. So, you have full control over your funds with VerusIDs.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really useful. I've also heard that VerusIDs are resistant to quantum attacks. How do VerusIDs protect against quantum attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, the Verus team is integrating a quantum secure signature scheme, which is expected to be activated on mainnet soon. With this feature, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. So, you can rest assured that your funds are safe from quantum attacks.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I've also heard that VerusIDs are revocable. What does it mean for a VerusID to be revocable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA revocable VerusID means that each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity. This creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft. So, you can revoke your ID if you need to, and prevent unauthorized access to your funds.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really useful. I've also heard that VerusIDs are a fully decentralized protocol. What are some key features of VerusIDs as a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are a fully decentralized protocol, which means that anyone can create one and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Additionally, VerusIDs are revocable and recoverable, with each ID including a revocation authority and a separate recovery authority, which default to the identity self. So, you have full control over your ID, and it's not controlled by any central authority.\n\n**User:**\nI see. And what does it mean for a VerusID to be recoverable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA recoverable VerusID means that each ID includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well. However, it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority. So, if your ID is revoked, you can recover it and regain control over your funds.",
