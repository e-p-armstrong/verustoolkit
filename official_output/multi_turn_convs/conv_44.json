It is expected to go live on the Verus mainnet on May 21, 2023, with the activation targeted at block 2546600. Mark your calendars!\n\n**User:**\nWhat makes the Verus PBaaS protocol stand out from other crypto platforms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus PBaaS protocol offers a range of capabilities that make it stand out from other crypto platforms, including cross-chain functionality, DeFi AMMs, decentralized markets, self-sovereign provable recoverable IDs, NFT capabilities, anti-phishing, anti-MEV, scale, and more. These capabilities enable fast, secure, and private apps and services with provable identity, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts. It's a powerful tool that will open up new possibilities for users and entrepreneurs alike!",

            "### What\u2019s New This release delivers on every part of the vision (and most stretch goals) either described in the vision paper of June 2018 or ever planned for the PBaaS release. Thanks to the incredible combined efforts of so many people in the community ranging from development, companies and projects joining and their open contributions (Valu/Arkeytyp, CHIPS, vDEX, VaultAlert, cragslist, and more) to community members supporting users to helping educate others who can contribute as well, we have run these protocols now for years as we\u2019ve improved them, and all of these capabilities will go live on the Verus mainnet May 21, 2023, with the activation expected targeting block 2546600.As a community, we\u2019ve discussed what the Verus PBaaS protocol can do for years. Now that it has existed on testnet for as long as it has, only those who have either been part of those conversations or experienced it first hand have a real sense for how much better Verus PBaaS is as a solution for cross-chain, DeFi AMMs, decentralized markets, self-sovereign provable recoverable IDs, NFT capabilities, anti-phishing, anti-MEV, scale, or just about any of the challenges people have on crypto platforms today. In fact, as we prepare for activation of this protocol that enables so many new use cases for crypto, not to mention easy onboarding when entrepreneurs discover how to really leverage VerusIDs, PBaaS is so far beyond what people are experiencing on any crypto platform today that it has been easy to dismiss our community as describing the impossible.Once we are live on mainnet and people can actually use all of this themselves, along with every project, chain and currency on the PBaaS network and EVERY ERC20 or ERC721 on Ethereum or even bridged to Ethereum, the truth of Verus will be self-evident, and those who build on Verus will more easily build faster, better, more secure apps and services with the possibility of provable identity + privacy, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts all seamlessly integrated into UIs that do not need business deals, permission, or any centralized infrastructure to connect services and users, enabling everyone to communicate in provable, private, or public ways that always include bidirectional, secure commerce of all kinds.This core capabilities of this release include (lots to learn to understand it all, but here\u2019s a partial list):",
