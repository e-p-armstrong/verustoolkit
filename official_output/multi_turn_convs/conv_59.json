    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you may have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering about some potential use cases for Verus's permissionless chain, token, and liquidity basket currency launches. Can you give me some examples?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome examples of use cases for Verus's permissionless chain, token, and liquidity basket currency launches include:\n\n* Crowdfunding an effort, similar to Kickstarter or IndieGoGo\n* Selling identities that are expected to add value or are sub-IDs of a valuable root ID\n* Launching an entirely new blockchain economy and blockchain that starts with Verus technology and a bridge to Verus and Ethereum from day 1\n\nThese are just a few examples, but the possibilities are endless! Do you have any other questions about Verus or its use cases?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. What was the purpose of launching a token on the old testnet and exporting it to Ethereum's Goerli?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of launching a token on the old testnet and exporting it to Ethereum's Goerli was to create a DAI proxy/simulant that could be used on the new testnet. This was done because the Verus team wants to use only decentralized currencies in the live mainnet bridge.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any more questions about Verus or its development process?",

            "4) **Permissionless Chain, Token, and Liquidity Basket Currency Launches**: Whether you are looking to crowdfund an effort in a manner much like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, sell identities to which you expect to add value or that are sub-IDs of a very cool root ID, or launch an entirely new blockchain economy and blockchain that starts with all of the Verus technology and a bridge to Verus and Ethereum from day 1, Verus is probably the best platform for you. In fact, as we were planning for the next testnet and wanted to have our own version of DAI to use in the bridge, since we want only decentralized currencies in the live mainnet bridge, we used a command to launch a token on the old testnet, exported it and all its supply to Ethereum\u2019s Goerli on the existing bridge, and that will be the DAI proxy/simulant that we will use on the new testnet. It saved us all some time, proving that Verus PBaaS will also be the easiest, most efficient way to launch even an Ethereum ERC20, whether that ERC20 represents a token, DeFi basket, or even another PBaaS blockchain \ud83d\ude42",
