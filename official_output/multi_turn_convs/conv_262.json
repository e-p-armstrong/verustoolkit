    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI need some help with pruning spent wallet transactions. How can I do that using the `prunespentwallettransactions` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can prune spent wallet transactions by running the `prunespentwallettransactions` command in the Verus CLI. You can also specify a particular transaction ID to prune by passing it as an argument to the command. For example:\n\n```\nverus prunespentwallettransactions \"1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d\"\n```\n\nThis will remove the specified transaction from your wallet. Do you have any more questions about pruning transactions?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How can I initiate a rescan of the entire chain using the `rescanfromheight` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can initiate a rescan of the entire chain by running the `rescanfromheight` command without specifying a height. For example:\n\n```\nverus rescanfromheight\n```\n\nThis will rescan the entire chain, which can be useful for recovering missing transactions or fixing wallet issues. Keep in mind that this command can take a significant amount of time to complete, especially for very large wallets.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. What is the `rescanfromheight` command used for in Verus, exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `rescanfromheight` command is used to rescan the current wallet from a specified height, which can be useful for recovering missing transactions or fixing wallet issues. This command can take a significant amount of time to complete, especially for very large wallets. It's a powerful tool, but use it with caution!\n\n**User:**\nI see. What about the `sendfrom` command? What is it used for, and why is it deprecated?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendfrom` command is used to send an amount from an account to a VRSC address. However, it is deprecated and should not be used. Instead, the `sendtoaddress` command should be used for sending funds to a VRSC address. We recommend avoiding the `sendfrom` command to ensure compatibility and security.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What about the `resendwallettransactions` command? What's that used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `resendwallettransactions` command is used to immediately re-broadcast unconfirmed wallet transactions to all peers. This command is intended only for testing purposes, as the wallet code periodically re-broadcasts automatically. It's not something you'll need to use in everyday usage, but it can be useful for debugging or testing.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about Verus!",
