    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. How can I assist you today?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for being here. I'm still learning about VerusIDs. How do they handle changes to their controlling addresses or multi-sig properties?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the controlling addresses or multi-sig properties of a VerusID are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity will follow the updated spend conditions and be subject to the updated keys. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nYou mentioned earlier that VerusIDs are \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses.\" What makes them that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\" because they are resistant to quantum attacks using known algorithms. Although Verus currently doesn't have quantum-resistant signatures for transactions, the VerusIDs themselves are quantum-resistant. Additionally, a quantum-secure signature scheme is being integrated, which will allow for retroactive quantum resistance of funds sent to an ID when it's activated on the mainnet. Do you have any more questions about quantum-resistance or VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nWhat are some key properties of VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs have several key properties, including:\n\n* **Revocable**: Each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity itself, and can revoke the identity, effectively freezing its funds.\n* **Recoverable**: Each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which defaults to self, and can recover the identity by redefining its primary and recovery states.\n\nNote that the revocation and recovery authorities have distinct permissions and cannot modify each other's states unless they are controlled by the same underlying authority. Does that help clarify things? Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or their properties?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is a key benefit of VerusIDs being a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne key benefit of VerusIDs being a fully decentralized protocol is that anyone can create one and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without needing permission. Additionally, all costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers, rather than a central authority. This allows individuals to be in full control of their digital identity, data, and assets. Do you have any more questions about Verus or VerusIDs?",

            "When the controlling addresses or multi-sig properties of a VerusID are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity will follow the updated spend conditions and be subject to the updated keys.",
            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. VerusIDs are:- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.- **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.",
