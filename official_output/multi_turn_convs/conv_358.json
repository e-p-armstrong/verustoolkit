    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! Do you have any questions about Verus or the Verus CLI/GUI?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, how can I rescan the blockchain using the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEasy one! To rescan the blockchain using the Verus CLI, simply add the parameter **\u201c-rescan\u201d** when starting the daemon. That should do the trick!\n\n**User:**\nAnd how about if I'm using the Verus GUI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo rescan the blockchain using the Verus GUI, follow these steps: Close the application and wait for the GUI to close. Restart the GUI. Select **\u201cActivate Coin\u201d**. Choose **\u201cVerus\u201d** and select **\u201cNative mode\u201d**. Select the **\u201cdaemon param: rescan\u201d** option. Click **\u201cActivate Coin\u201d**. That should rescan the blockchain for you!\n\n**User:**\nWhat's this I hear about Crypto-conditions and StakeGuard in Verus Coin 0.4.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCrypto-conditions in Verus Coin 0.4.0 is a technology that enables smart transactions and new types of on-chain functionalities. Verus has enhanced the original crypto-condition technology to make integration with standard transactions easier and enable things like StakeGuard, the Verus nothing-at-stake solution. In later releases, the same technology will enable PBaaS, voting, identity capabilities, and more.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about Sapling in Verus Coin 0.4.0? What are its benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSapling is a new address and transaction type in Verus Coin 0.4.0 that offers several benefits, including memory usage reduction of near 98% and performance improvements of typically 40-50x over previous z-transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! Is there anything I should be aware of when using Sapling addresses and transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using Sapling addresses and transactions in Verus Coin 0.4.0, it's important to note that older \u201cSprout\u201d addresses and \u201cSapling\u201d addresses may not be mixed in the same transaction. This means that if you have Verus Coin that you would like to move from an older Sprout z-address to a Sapling z-address, you must first send it to a transparent address, then to the Sapling z-address.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are some of the key fixes in Verus Coin 0.4.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the key fixes in Verus Coin 0.4.0 include a fix to an issue where the pool may exceed getblocktemplate's ability to keep up with the work queue when the network is under stress, a fix to the Verus bash script to allow execution from external directories, and improved Komodo compatibility.\n\n**User:**\nAnd finally, what's an important consideration when staking blocks with Verus Coin 0.4.0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen staking blocks with Verus Coin 0.4.0, it's important to note that staking is now off by default to prevent multi-machine staking of the same coins or addresses. To enable staking, use the \u201c-mint\u201d parameter with **verusd**, \u201csetgenerate true 0\u201d with the **verus** CLI, or the staking button in the GUI. Additionally, only stake any address or wallet on one computer at a time, unless you can be absolutely sure they are in sync and on the same chain at every block.",
