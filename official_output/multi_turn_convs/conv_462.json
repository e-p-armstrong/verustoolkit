    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in running a Verus Wallet on an ARM device. What are the minimum hardware and software requirements for running a Verus Wallet with a GUI on ARM devices?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum requirements for running a Verus Wallet with a GUI on ARM devices include a 64-bit processor, a 64-bit operating system with a GUI interface, 2 GB of memory plus 8 GB of swap space, 25 GB of storage space, internet connectivity, and the installation of `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries. Would you like to know the recommended requirements as well?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please. What are the recommended hardware and software requirements for running a Verus Wallet with a GUI on ARM devices?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe recommended requirements for running a Verus Wallet with a GUI on ARM devices include a 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled, a 64-bit operating system with a GUI interface, 8 GB of memory or more plus 6 GB of swap space, 50 GB of storage space on a fast medium, internet connectivity, and the installation of `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nWhat about staking? What are the minimum hardware and software requirements for staking on a Verus Wallet on ARM devices?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum requirements for staking on a Verus Wallet on ARM devices are the same as those for running a wallet, plus a fully configured and functioning NTP client to keep the clock synchronized, and low latency internet connectivity.\n\n**User:**\nAnd solo mining? What are the recommended hardware and software requirements for solo mining on a Verus Wallet on ARM devices?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe recommended requirements for solo mining on a Verus Wallet on ARM devices are the same as those for running a wallet, plus a 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled and low latency internet connectivity.\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I don't need a GUI? What are the minimum hardware and software requirements for running a Verus Wallet on ARM devices?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum requirements for running a Verus Wallet on ARM devices include a 64-bit processor, a 64-bit operating system, 2 GB of memory plus 6 GB of swap space, 20 GB of storage space, internet connectivity, and the installation of `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what are the recommended hardware and software requirements for running a Verus Wallet on ARM devices?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe recommended requirements for running a Verus Wallet on ARM devices include a 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled, a 64-bit operating system, 4 GB of memory or more plus 6 GB of swap space, 50 GB of storage space on a fast medium, internet connectivity, and the installation of `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries. I hope that helps! Do you have any more questions about Verus or ARM devices?",
