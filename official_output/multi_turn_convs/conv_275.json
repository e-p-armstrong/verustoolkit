    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a PBaaS blockchain in Verus. What information is required to define a PBaaS blockchain in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a PBaaS blockchain in Verus, you'll need to provide some information. Specifically, you'll need to provide the name of the chain, options, currencies, conversions, eras, notaries, minimum number of notaries required to confirm a block, nodes, gateway converter name, and gateway converter issuance. Make sure you have all that information ready to go!\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. I'm thinking of using the Verus Desktop GUI to create my PBaaS chain. Are there any limitations I should be aware of when using the GUI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is one limitation to keep in mind. In the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability. Just something to keep in mind when creating your chain!\n\n**User:**\nI was thinking of using an i-address as the name of an ID when creating a currency in Verus. Is that a good idea?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not a good idea. When an i-address is used as the name of an ID when creating a currency in Verus, it can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used, and will not be supported for creating currencies. This is because the naming system will interpret the i-address as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. So, it's best to choose a different name for your ID.",
