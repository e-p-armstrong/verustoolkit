    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the testnet and mainnet, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you help me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'`.\n2. Get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency` and use it to get the raw hex transaction data with `verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it with `verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>`.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>`.\n\nDoes that help? Do you have any further questions about signing transactions from multi-signature IDs?\n\n**User:**\nThanks, that was really helpful! I also have a question about tokenizing ID control with a next-generation NFT. What are the requirements for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo tokenize ID control with a next-generation NFT, the currency definition must have the following properties:\n\n* `options` set to `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN` (which is 2080 in decimal)\n* `maxsupply` set to 1 satoshi\n* `preallocations` must be either pre-allocated or pre-converted to, with a maximum pre-conversion of 0\n\nHere's an example of how to define such a currency:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```\nDo you have any questions about tokenizing ID control with a next-generation NFT, or would you like more information on the topic?\n\n**User:**\nI also have a question about creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent, you need to use the `registernamecommitment` command with the additional arguments for the currency parent and funding address. Here's an example:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr \"\" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny\n```\nThen, specify the parent in the identity definition and register the identity with:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny\n```\nDo you have any questions about creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent, or would you like more information on the topic?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I'm not really sure what the `registernamecommitment` and `registeridentity` commands are for. Can you explain their purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `registernamecommitment` command is used to register a name commitment for an identity, which is a necessary step before registering the identity itself. The `registeridentity` command is used to register the identity, specifying the parent currency and funding address. These commands are essential for creating and managing identities on the Verus network. Do you have any further questions about these commands or identities in general?",
