    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a currency with a specific name in Verus. What is required to create a currency with a specific name in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency with a specific name in Verus, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. Do you have any specific name in mind, or would you like to know more about the process?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I have a specific idea in mind. I want to launch a currency like \"gold\" that is mapped to a specific, auditable store of gold. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a currency like \"gold\" that is mapped to a specific, auditable store of gold, you can define the currency \"gold\" using the `definecurrency` command. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines the currency \"gold\" with specific options, conversions, and preallocations. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to initiate a currency launch. Would you like me to explain more about the command or the process?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps a lot! What happens during the launch of a currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDuring the launch of a currency in Verus, the currency is launched 50 blocks from when the transaction was made (default). The launch requires 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD. The mining process earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. Do you have any further questions about the launch process?\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm getting the hang of it. How can I create a new token like \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a new token like \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can define the currency \"mycoin\" using the `definecurrency` command. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines the currency \"mycoin\" with specific options, proof protocol, currencies, and initial supply. Do you have any questions about this command or the process of creating a new token?",

            "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level. First, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' ``` of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches. After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]' ``` that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back. Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]' ``` In \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID.
