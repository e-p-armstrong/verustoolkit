    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you may have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with Verus commands and I'm not entirely sure what they do. Can you tell me about the `z_getoperationstatus` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getoperationstatus` command is used to get the status of a specific operation, along with any associated result or error data. This command allows you to monitor the progress of an operation and retrieve any relevant information. Do you have any specific questions about using this command?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. How do I use the `z_getoperationstatus` command to retrieve the status of all operations known to the node?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo retrieve the status of all operations known to the node, you can use the `z_getoperationstatus` command without providing an \"operationid\" argument. This will return a list of JSON objects, each containing the status and any associated data for each operation. Would you like more information about the returned data?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. Thanks! I have another question about another command. How do I use the `z_importkey` command to add a zkey to my wallet and rescan the wallet for transactions from a specific block height?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo add a zkey to your wallet and rescan the wallet for transactions from a specific block height, you can use the `z_importkey` command with the following arguments:\n```\nz_importkey \"zkey\" \"yes\" startHeight\n```\nReplace \"zkey\" with the actual zkey, and \"startHeight\" with the desired block height to start the rescan from. Note that this command can take minutes to complete if rescan is true. Do you have any questions about the rescan process?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I think I understand. What's the purpose of the `z_gettotalbalance` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_gettotalbalance` command is used to retrieve the total value of funds stored in the node's wallet. It returns a JSON object containing the total balance of transparent funds, private funds, and the total balance of both.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what's the default minimum confirmation requirement for transactions included in the `z_gettotalbalance` result?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default minimum confirmation requirement for transactions included in the `z_gettotalbalance` result is 1 block confirmation.",
