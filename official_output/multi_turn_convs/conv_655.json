    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in learning more about VerusIDs. What kind of security features do they have?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs have several security features, including:\n\n1. **Revocable**: Each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and has the permission to revoke the identity, effectively freezing all of its funds.\n2. **Recoverable**: Each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state.\n\nThese features allow for secure management of VerusIDs in cases of key theft or other security breaches. Do you have any further questions about VerusIDs or their security?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really reassuring! I've also heard that VerusIDs are decentralized. Can you tell me a bit more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are fully decentralized, allowing anyone to create one and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without permission. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. This means that you're in control of your own digital identity, and you don't need to rely on a central authority to manage it. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that does! Another thing I'm curious about is what happens if the controlling addresses or single or multi-sig properties of a VerusID are changed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the controlling addresses or single or multi-sig properties of a VerusID are changed by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity will follow the updated spend conditions and be subject to the updated keys. This allows you to update your ID's security settings as needed, without affecting previous transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really powerful! What are some benefits of using VerusIDs on the worldwide Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs offer the benefits of being quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses, allowing users to receive and send funds with control over the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. Additionally, VerusIDs are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms, and will soon be able to be made retroactively quantum resistant with the integration of a quantum secure signature scheme. This means that your digital identity and assets are protected against potential quantum attacks, giving you peace of mind in the long run. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or the Verus network?",

            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself.
