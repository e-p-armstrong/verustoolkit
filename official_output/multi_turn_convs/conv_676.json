    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was wondering about the enhancements made to the RC1 cross-chain witness and notarization protocol in RC2. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn RC2, any notarization to be confirmed must be first posted publicly to allow for potential to prove invalidity, and then later confirmed. This is an enhancement over the prior protocol, where a witnessed notarization could be posted to a chain and accepted when first seen, which had an attack vector of even stolen notary/witness keys combined. Do you have any further questions about this enhancement?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. But I was also curious about the new methods to burn currency in liquidity currencies. How do those work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are two new methods to burn currency in liquidity currencies: `burnweight` and `burn`. `burnweight` is available to centralized currencies only, and it enables burning the primary currency to raise the reserve ratio weights of all reserves. On the other hand, `burn` for reserve currencies donates the burned amount of reserve into the currency's reserves without taking any new supply in exchange. Do you have any more questions about these methods?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I think I understand. But what is Bridgekeeper, and how can it be used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBridgekeeper is a feature that allows for permissionless bridge notarization. It is selectable in the GUI on the mining page, and a Node application will be made available for testing in the next few days. With Bridgekeeper, you'll be able to easily notarize bridges without needing permission. Do you have any other questions about Bridgekeeper?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that sounds cool. I was also wondering about tokenized ID control, and how it relates to NFTs.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTokenized ID control is a feature that allows an ID to be treated like a super NFT over all copies of the source ID on all chains that were exported to other chains after the currency was created. This enables NFTs to be upleveled with ID powers, being cryptographically bound as an ID's permanent control token that can be sent to any chain or to Ethereum and back. Do you have any more questions about tokenized ID control or NFTs?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. But what's the current status of NFT mapped tokens on Ethereum contracts?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNFT mapped tokens are not yet implemented in the Ethereum contracts, but they are supported on the RC2 PBaaS protocol. This means that you will not be able to send NFTs from Ethereum to Verus or PBaaS chains until the implementation is complete. We're working on it, though, and I'll make sure to let you know when it's ready!",
