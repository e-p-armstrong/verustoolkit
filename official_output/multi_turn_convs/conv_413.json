    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! How can I help you with Verus today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus network. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\n2. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n3. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any questions about the process?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks. Another question: How can I export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the command line and Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo export an ID to a PBaaS chain, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nThis command exports the ID \"IDNAME@\" to the PBaaS chain \"PBaaSChainName\" with an amount of 100 units of the currency \"vrsctest\". Do you have any questions about exporting IDs to PBaaS chains?\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the new Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet, and what features does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet is a testing environment that allows users to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for various use cases, such as businesses, governments, projects, or decentralized applications. It offers an easy-to-use GUI for basic operations and a command-line interface for more advanced functions. Users can send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease, and even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to themselves and converting along the way. Would you like to know more about the testnet or its features?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is Verus Vault, and what kind of protection does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that provides a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery for VerusIDs, NFTs, and other assets. It offers time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance, in addition to providing protection against common forms of crypto loss or theft. Would you like to know more about Verus Vault or its features?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of a locked VerusID, and how does it protect against the 5-dollar wrench attack?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA locked VerusID is a feature that provides an additional layer of security and protection against unauthorized access to funds. It allows the owner to set an unlock delay, which means that even if an unauthorized party gains access to the primary keys, they will have to wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access the funds. Meanwhile, the revocation and recovery authority identities can revoke and recover the ID at any time, circumventing the lock. This feature provides protection against the 5-dollar wrench attack, where an attacker uses physical coercion to gain access to a victim's private keys. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about locked VerusIDs or their security features?",
