    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus and its mining protocol, Verushash. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm curious about mining VRSC with Verushash. How can I estimate the profitability of mining VRSC with Verushash?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo estimate the profitability of mining VRSC with Verushash, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine your hardware's performance by comparing it to similar hardware in a Verushash Hashrates spreadsheet.\n2. Calculate your energy costs based on your local electricity prices.\n3. Use a profitability calculator or manual calculation to estimate your earnings based on your hardware's performance and energy costs.\n\nThat should give you a good idea of whether mining VRSC with Verushash is profitable for you. Do you have any further questions about estimating profitability or Verushash in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What types of hardware can be used to mine VRSC with Verushash?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe following types of hardware can be used to mine VRSC with Verushash:\n\n1. **CPU**: Modern CPUs with AES and AVX instructions (produced in 2013 or later) perform well for mining VRSC.\n2. **GPU**: Fairly modern Nvidia GPUs can also be used, although they may not perform as well as modern CPUs.\n3. **FPGA**: Many field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can be reprogrammed to mine VRSC and may outperform CPUs, but they require significant power consumption.\n\nSo, you have a few options to choose from, depending on what you have available or are willing to invest in. Do you have any further questions about the hardware or the mining process?\n\n**User:**\nIs mining VRSC with Verushash profitable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, mining VRSC with Verushash is currently one of the most profitable coins to mine using your CPU. However, to determine the profitability of mining VRSC, you need to consider several factors, including the hardware you use, your energy costs, and whether you already have the necessary hardware or need to purchase it.\n\nSo, while it can be profitable, it's essential to crunch the numbers and consider your specific situation before diving in. Do you have any further questions about the profitability of mining VRSC?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What factors influence the profitability of mining VRSC with Verushash?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe profitability of mining VRSC with Verushash depends on the following factors:\n\n1. **Hardware**: The type and performance of your mining hardware, such as CPU, GPU, or FPGA.\n2. **Energy costs**: The cost of electricity in your area, which affects the overall cost of mining.\n3. **Hardware acquisition**: Whether you already have the necessary hardware or need to purchase it, which affects the initial investment.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can get a better understanding of whether mining VRSC with Verushash is profitable for you. Do you have any more questions about Verus or Verushash?",

If you want to know how profitable it is, you need to know a few important details about your own conditions. 1. What hardware will I use to mine with?  1. CPU - If that is a fairly modern CPU with AES and AVX instructions built in.  This will be true if your processor is produced in 2013 or later. For processors between 2008 and 2012 you need to check the specifications.  Older processors can still mine, but they will not perform well.  2. GPU - It is possible to mine with fairly modern Nvidia GPU's, but since Verushash uses specific functions from the  mentioned AES and AVX instruction sets, they will perform better than old CPUs, but worse than modern CPUs.  3. FPGA - Many of these semi-specialized machines can be reprogrammed to mine VRSC. They don't have the same power per processor as a CPU, but they often have multiple processors running parrallel. The stronger ones can outperform a CPU easily, but need a lot of power to do so. 2. What is my energy price? 3. Do I use existing hardware or do I buy? If you know the answer to the hardware, you can look op a comparable one in the Spreadsheat from Link 1, to give you an idea of the performance. If you know your energy price also, you can [calculate](#!faq-allos/faq-allos02_average_time_to_find_a_block_manual_calculation.md) an estimation of how much your hardware can earn you at this moment. If you have to get new hardware just to mine, think about it for a moment: would you have bought new hardware anyway? If so, you can use this information to get an idea what kind of hardware you want to buy. Created by Oink.vrsc@",
