    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the Verus DeFi protocol and I'm curious about how it addresses some specific issues. How does it handle miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This prevents MEV and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also been wondering about the significance of simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches. What's the importance of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe simultaneous launch of a blockchain and a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool allows for a world-class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain to be launched alongside a functional liquidity pool. This enables seamless connectivity and fee generation on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really cool. I've heard about blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds. How do those work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen launching a new blockchain or bridge, you can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of your blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. This ensures that launches are successful and participants are protected.\n\n**User:**\nAnd I've heard that using VerusIDs in these launches can be beneficial. What's the advantage of using them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsing VerusIDs in blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches allows for vesting schedules to be included in pre-allocations, providing an additional layer of flexibility and control for launch organizers.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been wondering about the relationship between a PBaaS chain and the Verus chain that launched it. How do they interact?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA PBaaS chain runs from the same daemon as the Verus chain that launched it. This allows projects to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon, effectively inheriting a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I'd like to know more about Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies. What are they used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi fractional basket currencies allow ID owners to define currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. This enables the creation of custom currencies with flexible backing ratios, which can be used for various financial applications.",
