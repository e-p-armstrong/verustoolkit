    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a currency that's backed by a physical asset, like gold. How can I define a currency like \"gold\" that maps to a specific, auditable store of gold?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a currency like \"gold\" that maps to a specific, auditable store of gold, you can use the `definecurrency` command with a JSON object specifying the currency's properties. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a currency named \"gold\" with specific conversion rates and pre-allocation properties. Do you have any further questions about defining currencies in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is required to create a currency with a specific name in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency with a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. This ensures that each currency has a unique name and is controlled by its creator.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What if I want to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD after the GOLD token launches? How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the `sendcurrency` command with a JSON object specifying the conversion properties. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command parks the conversion until the token launches, at which point you will either receive 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the requirements for launching a currency like \"gold\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a currency like \"gold\", the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command. Additionally, at least 1000 VRSCTEST must be pre-converted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen mentions of `proofprotocol` when defining a new token. What does it mean to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new token like \"mycoin\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new token like \"mycoin\", it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID, which allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. This can be done using the `sendcurrency` command with a JSON object specifying the minting properties.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I create a new token like \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a new token like \"mycoin\" using the `definecurrency` command with a JSON object specifying the token's properties. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nThis command defines a token named \"mycoin\" with specific conversion rates and initial supply properties.",

I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level. First, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' ``` of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start.

I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches. After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option.
