    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a multi-currency PBaaS chain in Verus, but I want to make sure I'm aware of any limitations. What should I watch out for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen creating a multi-currency PBaaS chain in Verus, there are two limitations to be aware of:\n\n1. **Avoid using i-addresses as currency names**: Using an i-address as a currency name can cause problems and is not supported. This is because i-addresses are calculated based on name registrations, and using them as currency names can lead to confusion.\n2. **Avoid using existing currency names in the GUI**: In the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported (e.g., BTC or ETH), you cannot use the same name for a PBaaS chain. This limitation will be removed before mainnet availability.\n\nMake sure to keep those in mind when creating your PBaaS chain. Do you have any further questions about creating a PBaaS chain?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How do I define a PBaaS blockchain in Verus using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a PBaaS blockchain in Verus using the command line, you can use the `definecurrency` command with two JSON objects: one for the PBaaS blockchain definition and another for the overridable defaults of the bridge. Here is an example:\n\n```shell\n./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"options\":264,\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\"],\"conversions\":[1],\"eras\":[{\"reward\":1200000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0}],\"notaries\":[\"Notary1@\",\"Notary2@\",\"Notary3@\"],\"minnotariesconfirm\":2,\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.111:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node1@\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.112:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node2@\"}],\"gatewayconvertername\":\"Bridge\",\"gatewayconverterissuance\":1000000}' '{\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\",\"PBaaSChain\",\"USD\"],\"initialcontributions\":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],\"initialsupply\":3000000}'\n```\n\nThis command defines a PBaaS blockchain with the specified parameters. Do you have any questions about the required parameters or the format of the JSON objects?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! What are the essential components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe essential components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus include:\n\n1. `name`: the name of the chain.\n2. `options`: an integer that configures the chain.\n3. `currencies`: an array of currencies that can be converted to/from the chain's native currency.\n4. `conversions`: an array defining the conversion ratios between the chain's native currency and each listed currency.\n5. `eras`: an array defining the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each \"era\" in the chain's lifecycle.\n6. `notaries`: an array of VerusIDs that serve as notaries on the chain.\n7. `minnotariesconfirm`: the minimum number of notaries required to confirm a block.\n8. `nodes`: an array describing the network addresses of the nodes on the chain, as well as their IDs.\n9. `gatewayconvertername`: the name of the bridge converter.\n10. `gatewayconverterissuance`: the initial issuance of the bridge converter's native token.\n\nThese components are required to define a PBaaS blockchain in Verus. Do you have any further questions about these components or how they're used?\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the overridable defaults for the bridge definition in a PBaaS blockchain? What are those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe overridable defaults for the bridge definition in a PBaaS blockchain include:\n\n1. `currencies`: an array of currencies supported by the bridge.\n2. `initialcontributions`: an array specifying the initial liquidity for each currency in the bridge.\n3. `initialsupply`: the initial supply of the bridge's native token.\n\nThese defaults can be overridden when defining the bridge, but they provide a starting point for configuring the bridge's behavior. Do you have any more questions about PBaaS chains or bridges in Verus?",
