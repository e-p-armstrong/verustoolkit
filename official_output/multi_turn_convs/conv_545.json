    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to convert VRSCTEST to a newly created currency, such as GOLD, before it launches. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nConverting VRSCTEST to a newly created currency, like GOLD, before it launches is possible. You can do this by using the `sendcurrency` command. Here's an example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command effectively parks your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, but I'm curious about the requirements for a currency launch. What needs to happen before a currency launch can occur?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBefore a currency launch can occur, the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST, and there must be at least 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at the specified conversion rate. This happens as part of the mining process, and mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new currency.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What if I want to create a new currency, like \"mycoin\", that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST? How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a new currency, like \"mycoin\", that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST by using the `definecurrency` command. Here's an example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new currency named \"mycoin\" with specific properties, such as conversion rates, proof protocol, and more.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. How can I define a new currency, for example, \"gold\", using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can define a new currency using the `definecurrency` command. Here's an example of how to define a currency named \"gold\":\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new currency named \"gold\" with specific properties, such as conversion rates, preallocations, and more.\n\n**User:**\nI'm still a bit unclear about the relationship between an ID and a currency in Verus. Can you explain it to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, to create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. Does that clarify things for you?",

So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level. First, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' ``` of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches. After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option.
