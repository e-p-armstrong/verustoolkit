    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm still trying to wrap my head around VerusIDs. What's the difference between Native IDs and IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNative IDs, registered directly from a blockchain, can launch currencies on that blockchain, while IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies. However, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies are still valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs and have various other use cases, such as personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses, proofs, brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also heard about referral support for ID registration fees. What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nReferral support allows for multiple levels of referral support (up to 5 levels), which means that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. This incentivizes referrals and promotes the adoption of currencies. \n\n**User:**\nI thought Native IDs were the only ones that could create currencies, but I've heard there's an exception. What's the exception to non-native IDs creating currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe exception is that *.veth gateway IDs, available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter, will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. Registration of.veth IDs will be priced at a level to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about setting the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies. How can that be done?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves, such as USDC or DAI.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. I've heard that ID registration for decentralized fractional currencies is different from centralized currencies. What's the key difference?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe key difference is that for fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves. For centralized currencies, the ID registration fee is sent to the currency ID.",
