    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Is there something specific you'd like to know?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been curious about the concept of blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBlockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds allow users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of the blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund. This can also be applied to dual launches (blockchain and bridge). Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What about the VerusID protocol? Is it something that can be implemented on non-Verus systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusID protocol is a protocol that enables the use of IDs as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. And yes, the VerusID protocol can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! I've also heard that users with a VerusID have some capabilities in terms of creating their own tokens or blockchains. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsers with a VerusID have the ability to create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. This blockchain can be 50% POW/50% POS and 51% hash attack resistant.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really powerful. What benefits do projects gain by joining the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBy joining the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon, projects gain a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies. How do they work, and what benefits do they provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi fractional basket currencies are defined by ID owners and have one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. Finally, I've heard about the concept of simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSimultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches involve launching a new blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but are bound to the launch of the new blockchain, run on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.",
