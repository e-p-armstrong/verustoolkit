    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a new currency in Verus. How do I define a new currency in Verus using the command line, and what are the required parameters?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can define a new currency in Verus using the `definecurrency` command. The required parameters include:\n* `name`: the name of the currency\n* `options`: an integer specifying the currency's options\n* `currencies`: an array of currencies that can be converted to the new currency\n* `conversions`: an array of conversion ratios between the new currency and each currency in `currencies`\n* `minpreconversion`: an array of minimum amounts of each currency in `currencies` required to launch the new currency\n* `preallocations`: an array of pre-allocations of the new currency to specific IDs\n\nHere's an example command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nDo you have any further questions about defining a new currency in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps a lot. But I'm still a bit unclear about the relationship between an ID and a currency in Verus. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, to create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. Does that clarify the relationship between an ID and a currency in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Now, I'd like to create a new currency that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a new currency that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can use the `definecurrency` command with the following format:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. The `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID, allowing the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Do you have any questions about this command or how it works?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that's clear. But what happens when I send the `definecurrency` command, and how can I convert VRSCTEST to the new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you send the `definecurrency` command, it initiates a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default). The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command. The launch requires 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at the specified conversion rate to launch.\n\nTo convert VRSCTEST to the new currency, you can issue a `sendcurrency` command, like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of the new currency in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about creating or converting currencies in Verus?",

I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level. First, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' ``` of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start.

I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches. After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option.
