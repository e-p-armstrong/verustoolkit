    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some of the commands in Verus. Can you tell me what the purpose of the `setminingdistribution` command is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `setminingdistribution` command sets multiple mining outputs with amounts that will be used to calculate relative outputs to each address for any reward. It allows you to specify a JSON object with destination addresses and their corresponding relative values, which will be used to distribute mining rewards. Do you have any idea how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I think so. But just to make sure, can you give me an example of how to use the `setminingdistribution` command to set multiple mining outputs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `setminingdistribution` command by providing a JSON object with destination addresses and their corresponding relative values. For example:\n```\nverus setminingdistribution {\"myaddress\":0.5, \"otheraddress\":0.5}\n```\nThis command sets the mining distribution to split rewards 50/50 between \"myaddress\" and \"otheraddress\". Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that's clear. What about the `addmergedblock` command? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `addmergedblock` command adds a fully prepared block and its header to the current merge mining queue of the daemon. It allows you to specify parameters to determine the action to take if adding this block would exceed the available merge mining slots. Do you have any questions about merge mining or this command in particular?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I think I understand. What about the `submitblock` command? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `submitblock` command attempts to submit a new block to the network. It takes a hex-encoded block data as an argument and an optional JSON object of parameters. Do you know what kind of results you can expect from submitting a block using this command?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I'm not sure. What are the possible results of submitting a block using the `submitblock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe possible results of submitting a block using the `submitblock` command are:\n* \"duplicate\" - node already has a valid copy of the block\n* \"duplicate-invalid\" - node already has the block, but it is invalid\n* \"duplicate-inconclusive\" - node already has the block, but has not validated it\n* \"inconclusive\" - node has not validated the block, it may not be on the node's current best chain\n* \"rejected\" - block was rejected as invalid\n\nThese results should give you an idea of what's happening with your block submission. Do you have any more questions about these commands or Verus in general?",
