    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to lock an ID using the `updateidentity` API in Verus. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock an ID using the `updateidentity` API by setting the `flags` parameter to 0 and specifying the `timelock` parameter with the unlock block height. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nDo you have any questions about this process or would you like me to explain something?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm curious about the `timelock` parameter. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `timelock` parameter defines the unlock height of the identity when locking an ID, or the number of blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state when using a time delay. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a locked identity when it is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRevoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. Does that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nMoving on, I'd like to ask about the `getcurrencyconverters` API. What is it used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nWill return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\n**User:**\nHow do you send and convert funds using the `sendcurrency` API in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds. For example, to send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nOr to send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nDo you have any questions about this API?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the main advantage of the Verus network in terms of blockchain creation and interoperability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, with decentralized bridge confirmation provided by Notary IDs. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can easily bridge public currencies into an organization's internal network and back.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of Notary IDs in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains to easily bridge public currencies into an organization's internal network and back.",
