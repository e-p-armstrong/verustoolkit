    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm looking into using Verus, and I was wondering, what kind of warranty does the software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. So, you should be aware that you're using it at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. What's the purpose of a public blockchain as a service (PBaaS) software release, anyway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis software release is intended for testing and development with public blockchains as a service (PBaaS). It's not an official release, so you should use it at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nAlright, got it. So, I want to define a new chain using the command line. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can define a new chain using the `definechain` command with the following format:\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [{\"reward\" : 10000000000}], \"notarizationreward\" : 1440000000, \"billingperiod\" : 1440, \"nodes\" : [{\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2500\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"\"}, {\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2501\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"RDyDzC5JB66Y29fzBkamywqEn1PJXTzj8B\"}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a new chain with the specified properties, such as name, eras, notarization reward, billing period, and nodes.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. What are the minimum requirements for a chain definition, anyway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum requirements for a chain definition are:\n\n* A maximum of 3 eras\n* A minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations\n* A minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization\n* VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet to make a chain\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, how do I connect to a defined chain using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOnce a chain is defined, you can connect to it using the following command:\n```\n./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\nThis command connects to the specified chain, and on first connection, a local config file is created. After that, VRSCTEST will not be needed to run to connect, but it will be needed to merge mine.\n\n**User:**\nWhere are the config files for a PBaaS chain stored, anyway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe config files for a PBaaS chain are stored in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME` directory, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain.",
