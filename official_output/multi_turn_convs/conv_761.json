    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been having some issues with my antivirus software. It keeps flagging the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a common issue! If your antivirus software flags the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", it's likely a false positive. These warnings are because the software is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. You can review the following resources to learn more about the false positives: https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/ and https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/. Just ignore the warning and you should be good to go!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I also had an issue with VRSCTEST. I last launched it from a version prior to this release. What do I need to do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release, you need to delete the following directories before running this new update:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nJust delete those directories and you'll be able to run the new update without any issues.\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing. I was wondering, what's the disclaimer for Verus Desktop software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer for this software is that it is experimental and unfinished, and you use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Just keep that in mind when using the software.",
