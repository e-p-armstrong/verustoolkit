    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about VerusIDs. How can a locked VerusID be revoked and recovered?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA locked VerusID can be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which can circumvent the lock. This allows users to set up a decentralized solution to the 5-dollar wrench attack, where an unauthorized unlock can be detected and revoked. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain. It allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain. Transactions can be executed in a completely decentralized way, with the option to use transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses. The platform still allows owners to share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in the new economy of provable digital ownership.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is Verus Vault, and how does it protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows users to lock their VerusID, preventing funds from being spent until it is unlocked. Even if a private key is stolen, the funds will remain protected. While locked, users can still stake their funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. Additionally, users can still receive funds. To enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities, users must have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the significance of May 8, 2023, 4:00:00 PM, UTC, in relation to the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn May 8, 2023, 4:00:00 PM, UTC, the Verus testnet will transition to the v1.0.1 protocol without requiring a reset. Mark your calendar!\n\n**User:**\nWhat are some additional capabilities being introduced in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome additional capabilities being introduced in Verus include:\n\n* On-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs\n* On-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming\n* On-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles\n\nThese new features will further enhance the Verus ecosystem. Do you have any more questions about Verus or VerusIDs?",

            "Meanwhile, @alexenglish, @monkins1010, @asherda, quipacorn#5205, and others have been working on the Ethereum bridge deployment in preparation for this release. The testnet will transition to the v1.0.1 protocol with no reset required, Monday, May 8, 2023 4:00:00 PM, UTC. # Additional Verus Capabilities - On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs - On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming - On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.### Verus Vault With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.",
