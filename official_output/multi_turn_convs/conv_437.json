    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand the latest developments in Verus. What would you like to know about the project?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading the release notes, and I was wondering, what's the next step in the development of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the release notes, the next step in the development of Verus is the testnet rollout of the Ethereum bridge, followed by its deployment on Mainnet after final testing and review.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. I've been thinking about launching a PBaaS chain with zero block reward emissions. Is that a good idea?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, it's not recommended to launch a PBaaS chain with zero block reward emissions before the network is fully upgraded to v1.0.7 or later, as it may cause issues with cross-chain function. However, if you need to launch such a chain, you can discuss your options with someone in development or support to understand how to plan and mitigate potential issues.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does the v1.0.7 release mean for PBaaS chain launches and DeFi functions on the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith the v1.0.7 release, all PBaaS functions are now live and fully operational, and all oracle notarizations that were suppressing DeFi, currency sub-ID registrations, and PBaaS chain launches have been lifted from the network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great news! I've also heard that there were some changes to LP fees and DeFi baskets in the v1.0.7 release. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, in the v1.0.7 release, LP fees from exiting a DeFi basket's primary currency are now properly burned into those currencies before conversion operations take place.\n\n**User:**\nSo, what's the main purpose of the v1.0.7 release, and why is it so important?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main purpose of the v1.0.7 release is to resolve the issues that led to the pause of PBaaS and DeFi functions on Mainnet. It is highly recommended for Mainnet and mandatory for continued Testnet use to ensure that all functions, including PBaaS and DeFi, are fully operational and to prevent potential issues with cross-chain challenges.",

As mentioned, all LP fees from exiting a DeFi basket\u2019s primary currency will now be properly burned into those currencies before conversion operations take place.Shortly before this announcement, all oracle notarizations that were suppressing DeFi, currency sub-ID registrations, and PBaaS chain launches were lifted from the network. That means all PBaaS functions are now live and fully operational!Please note: Though the last mandatory upgrade was v1.0.6, and this is not technically a mandatory upgrade, it does address the known and understood issue only affecting zero reward PBaaS chains that can create issues with cross-chain challenges.Until everyone is known to be on v1.0.7 or later, and we announce that such PBaaS configurations are well supported on the network, we recommend that no one launch a PBaaS chain that has zero block reward emissions. If you choose to do so anyhow, your chain should properly launch, but for about the next month, you may have issues with cross-chain function, unless you understand and plan appropriately. If launching a chain with zero emissions is important to you, and you seriously can\u2019t wait, please discuss with someone in development or support to understand your options. We don\u2019t believe that this is a critical early use case, so we actually don\u2019t expect it to be an issue for anyone.Our next step is the testnet rollout of the Ethereum bridge, and after a few days of that proving out in final testing and review, we will deploy it on mainnet as soon as we believe it is ready for permanent use. Once the Ethereum bridge is live on mainnet, if we do ever need a contract upgrade, we will announce and coordinate with network validators, as each Ethereum contract upgrade will be independently subject to Verus miner and staker approval.Thanks everyone for upgrading as soon as you are able!### Additional Verus Capabilities - On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs - On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming - On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
