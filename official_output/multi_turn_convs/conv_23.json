    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been looking into how Verus works, and I was wondering, how do Notary IDs contribute to the functionality of the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can easily be set up with bridging of public currencies. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that helps! What's the main advantage of the Verus network in terms of blockchain creation and interoperability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, with decentralized bridge confirmation provided by Notary IDs. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can easily be set up with bridging of public currencies. It's a really powerful feature of Verus!\n\n**User:**\nI'm also trying to understand more about identities on Verus. What happens to a locked identity if it is revoked on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRevoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. So, if an identity is revoked, it will no longer be locked.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the timelock parameter when updating an identity on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe timelock parameter can be used to define either the unlock height of the identity (i.e., the block height at which the identity will be unlocked) or the number of blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. It's a way to control when an identity can be unlocked.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds on the Verus network. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds by specifying the source address, recipient address, currency, and amount. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from \"bob@\" to \"alice@\", you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nNote that testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, thanks! One last question: what is the `getcurrencyconverters` API used for on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It's a useful tool for working with currencies on Verus. Do you have any more questions about Verus or its APIs?",
