    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about VerusIDs, specifically their privacy features. What do they offer in terms of privacy?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs contain a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. Each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when available.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard about VerusHash 2.0. What was its significance in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.0 was an algorithm developed to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs on the Verus network. It was the first algorithm to significantly reduce the dominance of FPGAs over CPUs. The goal of VerusHash 2.0 was to keep FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU performance, and it has met its original goals.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about VerusHash 2.1? Is there a main difference between the two?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which is expected to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications.\n\n**User:**\nGood to know. I'm also curious about the disclaimer that comes with the Verus software. What does it say?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software comes with a disclaimer stating that it is experimental and unfinished software, and that users use it at their own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.",

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network. # DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
