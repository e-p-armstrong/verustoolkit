    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you may have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how staking rewards work. How do you know that a block has been minted and a staking reward has been earned?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo confirm that a block has been minted and a staking reward has been earned, you can look for the following characteristics:\n\nFirstly, the block hash should have few leading zeros. This is an indicator that the block has been successfully minted.\n\nSecondly, the last transaction in your wallet should have no fee, and it should be from the same address that it is to, which is also the address the coinbase is to. This transaction is the staking reward you've earned.\n\nLastly, the POS difficulty is encoded in the low 32 bits of the nonce with 96 of the next nonce bits as zero/reserved, followed by a random hash at the top half. This is a technical detail, but it's a way to verify that the block was minted correctly.\n\nBy checking for these characteristics, you can confirm that a block has been minted and a staking reward has been earned. Do you have any more questions about staking or Verus in general?",

            "# Question: How do you know a block was minted (staking reward)? You can see the following characteristics: 1. a block hash without a lot of leading zeros 2. a last transaction that in your wallet has no fee, is from the same address that it is to, which is also the address the coinbase is to (easiest confirmation) and 3. The POS difficulty is encoded in the low 32 bits of the nonce with 96 of the next nonce bits as zero/reserved, then a random hash at the top half (submitted by @keda666)",
