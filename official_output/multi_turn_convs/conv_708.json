    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on Verus. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on Verus, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\n2. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n3. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any further questions about signing transactions from multi-signature IDs?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I have another question. How do I export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the command line and Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nThis command exports the ID \"IDNAME@\" to the \"PBaaSChainName\" chain. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, thanks. One more question. How do I reset my testnet on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your testnet on Verus, you need to:\n\n1. Close Verus and ensure no testnet daemon is running.\n2. Delete the following directories:\n\t* On Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`\n\t* On Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`\n\t* On Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` (or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`)\n3. Restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native).\n\nThat should do it! Do you have any other questions about resetting your testnet?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is Verus Vault, and what kind of protection does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a decentralized solution that provides a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery for your IDs, NFTs, and assets. It offers time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance, and allows you to protect and recover your funds, preserving your blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, without the need for a bank.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the benefits of using a locked VerusID, and how does it protect against the 5-dollar wrench attack?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA locked VerusID provides an additional layer of security and protection against unauthorized access or theft. Even if someone gains access to the primary keys, they will need to wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This allows the revocation and recovery authority identities to detect and respond to unauthorized unlocks, effectively mitigating the 5-dollar wrench attack.",
