    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I've been thinking about converting some VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency, such as GOLD. How do I do that in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency, such as GOLD, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the `convertto` option. For example:\n\n```./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'```\n\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What happens when a currency is launched in Verus, and how do miners benefit from the launch process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a currency is launched in Verus, it happens as part of the mining process. Miners earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch by mining the blocks that launch the currency, which converts the preconverted amount of the underlying currency (e.g., VRSCTEST) to the new currency (e.g., GOLD).\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what if I want to create a new currency that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST? How do I do that, and what's the role of the proof protocol in this process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a new currency that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can use the `definecurrency` command with the `proofprotocol` option set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID). This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins.\n\nFor example:\n\n```./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'```\n\nThe `proofprotocol` option determines how new coins are minted. In this case, the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins using the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But how do I define a currency in Verus in general, and what are the important parameters to consider?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a currency in Verus, you use the `definecurrency` command. Important parameters to consider include:\n\n* `name`: The name of the currency.\n* `options`: An integer that configures the currency's properties.\n* `currencies`: An array of currencies that the new currency can be converted to.\n* `conversions`: An array of conversion ratios between the new currency and the currencies in the `currencies` array.\n* `minpreconversion`: The minimum amount of the currency needed to preconvert to the new currency.\n* `preallocations`: An array of allocations of the new currency to specific IDs.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. What is the requirement to create a currency with a specific name in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency with a specific name, you need an ID of the same name, and the controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.",

I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level. First, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:  ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' ``` of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches. After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option.
