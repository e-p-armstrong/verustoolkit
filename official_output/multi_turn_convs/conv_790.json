    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi! I'm here to help with your questions about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm thinking about creating a currency from an ID in Verus. Are there any limitations I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen creating a currency from an ID in Verus, you should be aware of the following limitations: You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What's the general advice regarding creating an ID with an i-address as its name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe general advice is to avoid creating an ID with an i-address as its name, as it can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used. It's better to be safe than sorry!\n\n**User:**\nI've also been thinking about creating a PBaaS chain with a currency name that's already supported, like BTC or ETH. Are there any limitations in the GUI version of Verus that I should know about?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, in the GUI version of Verus, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. However, this limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! Finally, what's the disclaimer associated with using Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer associated with using Verus software is that it is experimental and unfinished software, and the user assumes all risks. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. It's important to keep that in mind when using Verus. Do you have any more questions about Verus or its usage?",

            "When creating a currency from an ID in Verus, you should be aware of the following limitations:\n\n1. You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.",
            "#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of: 1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain.
