    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was looking at the terms for the software, and I was wondering, what kind of warranty or guarantee is provided with this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the terms, no warranty is provided with this software. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without any kind of warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What kind of liability do the authors or copyright holders of this software assume?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders of this software assume no liability for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that some antivirus software might flag this software as a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, might flag this software as a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program) because it includes mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are some of the notable features of this software release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis release enables two technology upgrades: an improvement to the FPGA-equalizing hash algorithm, and a revolutionary, new decentralized identity technology, Verus IDs. These features bring significant advancements to the Verus ecosystem.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",

It is considered fully ready for testing on both VRSCTEST testnet and VRSC mainnet. While this release is likely to work fine on mainnet through the coming activation, it is not yet an official release that you should expect to support mainnet activation. If you install this version, please make sure to upgrade to an official release before network activation, which will happen at block 800200, expected to be mined or staked on December 15th.
