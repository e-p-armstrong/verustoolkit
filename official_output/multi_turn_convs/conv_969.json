    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand PBaaS chain definitions. What's the purpose of OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER in a PBaaS chain definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER is an option in a PBaaS chain definition that means the specified converter will be the default converter for a specific PBaaS gateway and will publish prices. Do you have any more questions about PBaaS chain definitions or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. How do I create a currency with a specific name in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency with a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. Do you have any further questions about creating currencies in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the requirements for launching a currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a currency, the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command to initiate a currency launch. Additionally, there must be a minimum amount of VRSCTEST preconverted at a specific rate in order to launch. Do you have any more questions about launching currencies or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency, like GOLD?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency like GOLD by using the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command would effectively park the conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. Do you have any more questions about converting currencies or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST by defining the currency with the `definecurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. Do you have any more questions about creating tokens or Verus in general?",

The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level. First, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:  ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' ``` of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches. After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:  ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]' ``` that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
