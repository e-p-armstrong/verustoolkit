    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in using Verus for some advanced currency operations. Specifically, I'd like to know more about the `getcurrencyconverters` API. What is its purpose, and how can it be used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It can be used to find currencies that have specific markets at or above a certain liquidity threshold. For example, `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\nWould you like to know more about using this API, or is there something else you'd like to ask about?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I was also wondering about the `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` currency option. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` currency option is a flag that allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set. It is used when defining a currency in Verus. This option can be useful when working with fractional currencies or reserve conversions.\n\nDo you have any other questions about Verus currency options, or would you like to know more about using Verus for currency operations?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do! I'd like to know how I can use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds in Verus.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds in Verus. It's a powerful tool that allows you to perform a variety of operations. You can use it to send funds from a single address to a single recipient, send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, convert funds to a fractional basket currency, convert funds to another reserve through a fractional currency, preconvert to a new currency before it is active, send funds cross-chain to a PBaaS chain, convert funds cross-chain to a PBaaS chain, and convert funds from a PBaaS chain to Verus.\n\nThe `sendcurrency` API is very flexible, and the specific use case will depend on your needs. Do you have any specific scenarios in mind where you'd like to use this API, or would you like more general information on how to get started with it?",
