    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm looking into a specific version of the Verus CLI or GUI wallet and I was wondering, what is the severity of the update, and why?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe update is considered CRITICAL, but not mandatory. This is because the issue fixed by this update does not expose any funds to theft or counterfeit, but rather fixes a vulnerability that an attacker may exploit to probe for information regarding a specific node's control over private keys. So, it's important to update, but your funds are still safe if you don't.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What updates to Sapling functionality are included in this version of the Verus CLI or GUI wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis version includes updates to Sapling functionality, including the Sprout to Sapling migration APIs added to the Zcash protocol up to and including version 2.0.7-3 of Zcash. So, you'll get the latest Sapling features with this update.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about the testnet. What's the impact of the new Verus update on the testnet, and what action do users need to take before running it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe testnet will be deleted and relaunched for this release. If you've previously launched VRSCTEST, you'll need to delete specific directories before running this new update. The directories to be deleted vary by operating system: Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Make sure to take care of that before running the update.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and Verus Reserve cross-chain currency conversion technology. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and Verus Reserve cross-chain currency conversion technology is a Technology Preview that enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. It allows for easy cross-chain transactions and conversions between currencies, with a standard protocol fee of 0.01% that goes to miners and stakers of the network. It's a powerful tool for creating and managing your own blockchains and currencies!",
