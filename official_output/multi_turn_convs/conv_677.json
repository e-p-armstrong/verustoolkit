    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating my own currency in Verus. How do you define a currency in Verus, and what are some of the important parameters involved?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can define a currency in Verus using the `definecurrency` command. Some important parameters involved are:\n\n* `name`: The name of the currency.\n* `options`: An integer that configures the currency's properties.\n* `currencies`: An array of currencies that the new currency can be converted to.\n* `conversions`: An array of conversion ratios between the new currency and the currencies in the `currencies` array.\n* `minpreconversion`: The minimum amount of the currencies in the `currencies` array required to launch the currency.\n* `preallocations`: An array of preallocated amounts of the currency to specific IDs.\n\nDo you have any questions about these parameters or the `definecurrency` command?\n\n**User:**\nBefore I create a currency, is there a prerequisite I need to meet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. So, make sure you have the necessary ID before creating your currency!\n\n**User:**\nLet's say I've created a new currency called GOLD. How can I convert VRSCTEST to GOLD in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency, such as GOLD, by issuing the `sendcurrency` command with the `convertto` option. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will effectively park the conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either receive the converted amount of GOLD or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens when a currency is launched in Verus, and how do miners benefit from it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a currency is launched in Verus, it happens as part of the mining process. Miners earn a 0.025% conversion fee for participating in the launch by mining the blocks that launch the currency. This conversion fee is paid in the form of the new currency, converted from the original currency (e.g., VRSCTEST).\n\n**User:**\nHow can I create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST by defining the currency with the `definecurrency` command and specifying the `currencies` array to include both GOLD and VRSCTEST. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nThis command defines a new token called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST.",

I would like to have one currency, gold@, that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold. I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level. First, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}' ``` of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches. After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command: ``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]' ``` that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back. Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:``` ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]' ``` In \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID.
