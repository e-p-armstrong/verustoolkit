    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in trying out the new protocols on the Verus testnet. How can I access it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can access the Verus testnet by visiting the Verus Discord and asking in the #pbaas-development channel for a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies. You can use this link as an invite to the Verus Discord: https://discord.gg/gecZsCf-. Once you're there, you can ask for the currencies and start testing out the new protocols!\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! I also noticed there's a new RPC API called `getcurrencyconverters`. What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` RPC API enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This allows wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.\n\n**User:**\nWow, that sounds really powerful! What are some of the new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet include DeFi and cross-currency liquidity integrated with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, as well as a 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm. Additionally, there is a new RPC API called `getcurrencyconverters` that enables system-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what's the purpose of the Verus DeFi testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network that allows testing and hardening of new Verus protocols before they are deployed on the mainnet. It is a platform for testing and refining new capabilities and features before they are released to the public. It's a great way to try out new things and help the Verus community make the network even better! Do you have any more questions about the testnet or Verus in general?",

            "## The New Verus DeFi Testnet This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever announced, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it\u2019s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel.

We will list it here and describe it below. Using it is simple. Understanding the implications of what such a protocol can do when rent free and integrated in a truly decentralized public blockchain is a process of realizations that is likely to be similar to layers of an onion.
