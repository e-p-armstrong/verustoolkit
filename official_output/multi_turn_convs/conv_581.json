    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you learn more about Verus. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about crowdfunding currency launches on the Verus network. How do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn the Verus network, blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches allow users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of their blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund. This is also possible for dual launches (blockchain and bridge).\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. What is the VerusID protocol, and how can it be used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusID protocol is a protocol that allows IDs to be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. Additionally, the VerusID protocol can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.\n\n**User:**\nAre there any potential threats to IDs on the Verus network that I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are some potential threats to IDs on the Verus network. Some of these include the 5$ wrench attack and identity theft.\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of capabilities does the Verus network provide to users with an ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network allows any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack-resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it.\n\n**User:**\nThat's amazing! I've also heard about Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies. What are they, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi fractional basket currencies are currencies that can be defined by any ID owner, with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner-extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers.",

The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems. ### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. ### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets - Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing.
