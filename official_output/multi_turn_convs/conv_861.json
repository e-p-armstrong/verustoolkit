    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to install the Verus software, but my antivirus software keeps flagging it as a potential threat. What can I do about this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's frustrating! Don't worry, it's a common issue. You can review the resources provided to learn more about the false positives and why they occur. You can also whitelist the software in your antivirus settings to allow it to run. Would you like more information on why this might be happening?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that would be great. Why might antivirus software flag this software as a potential threat?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAntivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky may flag this software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program) because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and it is not a virus or malware. The software is safe to use, but the antivirus software is being cautious.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I understand. What are my rights when using this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou are granted permission to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so, subject to the condition that the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. In other words, you have a lot of freedom to use and modify the software as you see fit.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! What kind of software is this, and what kind of warranty or liability does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis is experimental and unfinished software, and it comes with no warranty or liability for any kind of damage. It is provided \"as is\", without any express or implied warranties, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Please use it at your own risk, and be aware that it's still in development.",
