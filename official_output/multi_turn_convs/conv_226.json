    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to use the `listtransactions` command, but I'm not sure what to expect from the result. Can you tell me what the format of the result is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `listtransactions` command is a JSON array of objects, each representing a transaction. The objects contain the following properties:\n\n* \"account\" (string): The account name associated with the transaction.\n* \"address\" (string): The VRSC address of the transaction.\n* \"category\" (string): The transaction category (send, receive, or move).\n* \"amount\" (numeric): The amount in VRSC.\n* \"vout\" (numeric): The vout value.\n* \"fee\" (numeric): The amount of the fee in VRSC.\n* \"confirmations\" (numeric): The number of confirmations for the transaction.\n* \"blockhash\" (string): The block hash containing the transaction.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the `listtransactions` command?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What are the arguments that can be passed to the `listtransactions` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listtransactions` command takes four optional arguments:\n\n1. \"account\" (string, optional): The account name. Should be \"*\".\n2. count (numeric, optional, default=10): The number of transactions to return.\n3. from (numeric, optional, default=0): The number of transactions to skip.\n4. includeWatchonly (bool, optional, default=false): Include transactions to watchonly addresses.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the `listtransactions` command?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I think that helps. But I was also wondering, what's the purpose of the `listtransactions` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listtransactions` command is used to retrieve a list of transactions for a specific account, with optional filtering and pagination.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also seen the `listsinceblock` command. How can I use that to retrieve transactions from a specific block hash?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `listsinceblock` command by specifying the block hash as an argument, followed by the number of transactions to retrieve. For example:\n```\nverus listsinceblock \"000000000000000bacf66f7497b7dc45ef753ee9a7d38571037cdb1a57f663ad\" 6\n```\nThis command will retrieve the 6 most recent transactions starting from the block with the specified hash.",
