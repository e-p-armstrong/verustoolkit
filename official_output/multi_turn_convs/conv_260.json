    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the public blockchains as a service (PBaaS) testing release. What is its purpose, and is it an official release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of the public blockchains as a service (PBaaS) testing release is for testing and development with PBaaS. It's not an official release and should be used at your own risk. It doesn't support PBaaS on the mainnet, so keep that in mind.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. What kind of warranty is provided with the software, and what are the liability limitations of the authors and copyright holders?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The authors and copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nUnderstood. I'd like to connect to a defined chain. How do I do that, and what happens on the first connection?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo connect to a defined chain, you can use the command `./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN`. On the first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's an example of a chain definition, and what are the minimum requirements for a chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAn example of a chain definition is:\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [{\"reward\" : 10000000000}], \"notarizationreward\" : 1440000000, \"billingperiod\" : 1440, \"nodes\" : [{\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2500\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"\"}, {\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2501\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"RDyDzC5JB66Y29fzBkamywqEn1PJXTzj8B\"}]}'\n```\nThe minimum requirements for a chain are:\n\n* A maximum of 3 eras\n* A minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations\n* A minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization\n* VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet to make a chain\n\n**User:**\nFinally, where are the config files for PBaaS chains stored?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe config files for PBaaS chains are stored in `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME`, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain. The presence of a correct config file for any chain enables the chain to load as an independent chain.",
