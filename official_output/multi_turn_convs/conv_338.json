    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI just downloaded Verus and I want to make sure it's authentic. How do I verify the authenticity of a Verus download using the included text file?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the CLI to verify the signature. This ensures that the download is genuine and hasn't been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! I was wondering, what identity is used to sign the Verus downloads?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus downloads are signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". This is the official identity used by the Verus team to sign and verify the authenticity of Verus downloads.\n\n**User:**\nI heard there was a recent upgrade to the Verus Mainnet Protocol. What was upgraded at block 1053660?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAt block 1053660, the Verus Mainnet Protocol was upgraded to the new Komodo Notary Nodes for Komodo dPoW notarization, season 4. This upgrade also included a change to the Verus Proof of Power staking and mining hash.\n\n**User:**\nWhat features were activated with the network upgrade at block 1053660?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe network upgrade activated several exciting features, including:\n\n* Added support for season 4 Komodo notary node operators\n* Coinbase shielding is no longer required on any coinbases from the past that have not yet been shielded\n* Staking now works on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds\n* A new \"sendcurrency\" API for the command line provides more control when sending from and to multiple addresses or identities\n* \"updateidentity\" can now change the case of characters in the name of a VerusID in the global locale\n* Revocation identity will now lose all control over an ID after revocation, including the ability to still change the revocation identity itself\n* Staking and hashing consensus protocol updates with VerusHash 2.2\n\nThese features bring significant improvements to the Verus ecosystem, and we're excited to see how they'll benefit our users!",
