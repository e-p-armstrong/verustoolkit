    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nYeah, so I've been thinking about VerusIDs and I was wondering, what are some benefits of Verus IDs being a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome benefits of Verus IDs being a fully decentralized protocol include: anyone can create a Verus ID without permission, the creator of a Verus ID has complete, self-sovereign control over it, and all costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers, rather than a central authority. This allows individuals to have full control over their digital identity, data, and assets. Do you have any further questions about VerusIDs?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also curious about the significance of Verus IDs being \"quantum-ready friendly\". What does that mean exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs being \"quantum-ready friendly\" means that they are resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs themselves are resistant to quantum attack. Additionally, a quantum secure signature scheme is being integrated, which will allow for retroactive quantum resistance of funds sent to an ID when it is changed. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what are Verus IDs, and how do they differ from other blockchain ID implementations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. Verus IDs provide opportunities for identity applications and offer features such as quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses, fully decentralized protocol, and self-sovereign control. They're a unique solution that puts individuals in control of their digital identity.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What are some potential applications of digital signatures in the context of Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome potential applications of digital signatures in the context of Verus ID include: journalists signing photos, videos, and content to establish a reputation for authenticity and counter the potential for deep-fakes, open source projects creating their own identities and digitally signing their binary releases to ensure authenticity, physical entry systems, workflow applications, and new earning opportunities. The possibilities are endless, and we're excited to see how the community will utilize Verus IDs.",
