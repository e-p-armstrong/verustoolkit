# Introduction to Verus

Welcome to the Verus documentation. Here you find all mainnet and testnet protocol features and implementations. The documentation will be updated continuously.

## Open-source, rent-free, scalable public infrastructure
Verus is an open-source, [fairly launched](/overview/#fair-launch), decentralized blockchain protocol with proof-of-work and proof-of-stake as its consensus mechanism. It offers rent-free blockchain tools for creators and organizations to build products, services and systems. 

Verus is a multichain protocol with strong focus on scalability, security and decentralization. It can scale to world demand, is proven 51% hash attack resistant and is community built - all coins in circulation are fairly mined and staked.

With Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) anyone can launch scalable, fully interoperable, customizable and independent blockchains for public or private use. Launch tokens & basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools) on top of blockchains for any use case. Get funding and create markets with protocol level built-in DeFi and smart launch options.

Protocol-level self-sovereign digital identities and namespaces ([VerusID](/verusid/)) are at the center of the Verus multichain protocol. Giving builders, communities, businesses and organizations tools never before seen.

Everything happening on the Verus multichain protocol has aligned incentives with the [miners and stakers](/economy/) of the worldwide network. This makes it one of the most secure protocols with opportunities to earn.


## Low-cost, rapid & easy deployment
Launch blockchains, tokens, liquidity pools, identities and much more without any coding needed, just simple API commands. Save money on expensive blockchain (Solidity) developers & infrastructure with the rent-free Verus Protocol.

* **No programming needed for [blockchain](/blockchains/), [token and currency launches](/currencies/)**
* **Low protocol fees**

## Scalability
Verus achieves practically unlimited scalability through its [Public Blockchains as a Service](/blockchains/). Verus PBaaS enables the provisioning of an unlimited number of independent, interoperable and interconnected L1 blockchains, which inherit all Verus L1 features. 

Verus' scale out TPS (transactions-per-second) is better than what other blockchains have today. A single PBaaS chain can reach between 75 and 800 TPS depending on blocktime; a network of several thousand chains would have a total bandwidth of 1 million+ TPS. But there is no maximum TPS metric because such a thing does not exist on an open fractal network like Verus.

* **Create use case specific blockchains and currencies** 
* **Move activity between chains to avoid congestion**

## Security
Verus and its PBaaS-blockchains are 51% hash attack resistant. All functionality can be found in the consensus layer (L1), making the protocol secure for developers and users. No smart contract risks — Verus uses smart transactions, not smart contracts.

* **51% hash attack resistant through [Verus Proof of Power](/overview/verus-proof-of-power/)**

## Interoperability
Verus enables a world where all blockchains communicate with each other. All PBaaS-chains are interoperable and interconnected. Verus and all PBaaS-chains are now also connected to Ethereum, in a trustless and non-custodial way.

## Decentralized & community-built
Verus is a decentralized public blockchain, a community driven project in the true spirit of Bitcoin. Anyone can participate and contribute, no matter who you are or where you come from. Verus is:
* **Open**
* **Borderless**
* **Public**
* **Neutral**
* **Censorship resistant**

Anyone can start mining and staking the Verus Protocol. Mobile phones and ARMs (e.g. Orange Pi 5) are the most energy efficient devices to mine Verus (and 22 other PBaaS-chains) with. To stake there are no minimum requirements or locking of funds.

There is no company behind Verus, it is community-built. All protocol fees go to the block producers of the network (the miners and stakers).

These characteristics that anyone can participate in the Verus Protocol makes it one of the most decentralized networks worldwide.

## Fair launch
Verus had a fair launch, meaning that everyone had, and still has equal opportunity to collect its currency through mining and staking. For Verus this means:
* **No ICO has been held**
* **No founder or developer fees/tax**
* **No premine**
* **No commercial interests**
* **No rent-seeking behavior**

The launch of the Verus blockchain was announced on the Bitcointalk.org forum [See post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4070404.0) 15 minutes before the first block could be mined.
