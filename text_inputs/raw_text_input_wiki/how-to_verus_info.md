|Total supply:       |83'540'184, no premine, no ICO.|
|Reward emission schedule:| Started with linear ramp, changing every block for the first 10,080 blocks (0 to 384 VRSC) and then halving every month for the following 5 months, then every 2 years after that. All rewards, at or above 192 are time locked for random release between block 129,600 and 1,181,520 (3 months to 2 years and 3 months after genesis).|
|Reward maturing:    |100 blocks to maturity|
|PoS Period:         |150 blocks cooldown of UTXO|
|Unique features:    |VerusID: VerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. VerusIDs provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications.|

#### Mining:

VerusCoin can be mined with CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs, solo and in pools. However, the algo is carefully designed for CPUs, and they still substantially outrange GPUs.
ARM mining works in general, but although fairly efficient, without high hashrates. FPGAs can mine this coin, but don't outperform CPUs by much.

##### Miners:
Besides solo-mining with Verus Desktop or CLI wallet, you can use:
ccminer for CPU (efficient for most modern CPUs) or GPU https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer/releases;
nheqminer https://github.com/VerusCoin/nheqminer/releases (for Windows, Linux, and MacOS);

A spreadsheet to compare hashrates can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrSYJDV0Mjj3X-myMC3aQDGkcipivxHsD7ZxJ3r5f_A/edit#gid=201266774
You can also compare older and current algos
