# Release Notes

## v1.0.7
Announcing v1.0.7 - UPGRADE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET, MANDATORY FOR CONTINUED TESTNET USE

ALL PBAAS AND DEFI FUNCTIONS HAVE NOW RESUMED ON MAINNET. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING v1.0.6 OR LATER AT THIS TIME

TESTNET USERS SHOULD UPGRADE ASAP, AS USUAL. THERE WILL BE A FORKING CHANGE ON TESTNET THAT WILL ACTIVATE TO RE-ENABLE ZERO EMISSION PBAAS CHAIN CHALLENGES TOMORROW, AFTER 19:00 UTC

This release marks the completion and full resolution of the investigations that led to the PBaaS and DeFi pauses. As mentioned, all LP fees from exiting a DeFi basket’s primary currency will now be properly burned into those currencies before conversion operations take place.

Shortly before this announcement, all oracle notarizations that were suppressing DeFi, currency sub-ID registrations, and PBaaS chain launches were lifted from the network. That means all PBaaS functions are now live and fully operational!

Please note: Though the last mandatory upgrade was v1.0.6, and this is not technically a mandatory upgrade, it does address the known and understood issue only affecting zero reward PBaaS chains that can create issues with cross-chain challenges.

Until everyone is known to be on v1.0.7 or later, and we announce that such PBaaS configurations are well supported on the network, we recommend that no one launch a PBaaS chain that has zero block reward emissions. If you choose to do so anyhow, your chain should properly launch, but for about the next month, you may have issues with cross-chain function, unless you understand and plan appropriately. If launching a chain with zero emissions is important to you, and you seriously can’t wait, please discuss with someone in development or support to understand your options. We don’t believe that this is a critical early use case, so we actually don’t expect it to be an issue for anyone.

Our next step is the testnet rollout of the Ethereum bridge, and after a few days of that proving out in final testing and review, we will deploy it on mainnet as soon as we believe it is ready for permanent use. Once the Ethereum bridge is live on mainnet, if we do ever need a contract upgrade, we will announce and coordinate with network validators, as each Ethereum contract upgrade will be independently subject to Verus miner and staker approval.

Thanks everyone for upgrading as soon as you are able!

### Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

#### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

#### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

#### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
#### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock "id@" '{"unlockatblock": <Unlock block height>}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock "id@" '{"setunlockdelay": <Unlock block delay>}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


#### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain 
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@"
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## v1.0.6
Announcing v1.0.6 - MANDATORY MAINNET UPGRADE WITH COMMUNITY AGREED DEADLINE ON TUESDAY, MAY 30th, 19:00 UTC

As everyone can see, there is a currency on the chain called RaceCondition, which someone has defined and is a 5% algorithmically controlled fractional reserve of Verus. While these currencies are tools, and there may be good reasons for 5% currency components or even 5% currencies in some applications, this was launched as a VERY low reserve (launched with 10 VRSC in reserves), high supply currency (100 million supply), and as volatile as the protocol allows at 5%.

The extreme nature of the currency and the fact that the person who launched it exited with their entire pre-launch amount when someone else joined resulted in a behavior different than what I would expect. Someone converted into the currency, which was clearly all in the hands of one individual. That individual then converted all of the currency they got at launch to VRSC, getting the highest price they could get for all of their currency and leaving the highly volatile, 5% fractionally backed currency with far fewer reserves relative to supply than it had before, basically an exit scam for a grand total of 4 VRSC.

The thing that made me take notice is that there seemed to be more reserves left and a higher price at the end of this operation than I’d expect in the currency, and that turned out to be because only in the case of a straight conversion from fractional to a reserve, not in any other case, the fractional currency fees that should have been burned into the basket were not being captured. Interestingly, in this case it resulted in a form of buffer at the extreme, where the person who entered RaceCondition for 5 VRSC after it was launched and subsequently had 4 of it taken on the exit from one person converting 100,000,000 of the supply ended up with more than they would have, had the math been properly distributing those fees. This was the totality of the issue we found, and though it may not seem that serious to require a pause of DeFi, these calculations are consensus, and we take any error that we find in them, fees or otherwise, quite seriously. This update will operate on the updated rules when the oracle notifications are removed and DeFi is reactivated.

The fix means that all fees, including the fractional fees on an exit from a liquidity basket are burned before conversions take place, which in this case, would enable the person who exited with 100MM RaceCondition to take 15 VRSC, instead of the 14 that they did. This is because the correct fee allocation results in a 15 SAT price, which means the person who remains holding the RaceCondition bag would have only some 100s of thousands of SATs left in reserves. On the other hand, anyone could come in and reinflate the 5% currency by converting to it. This event on the network had the effect of reducing the extreme difference between supply and reserves on RaceCondition, and it will operate as a normal 5% reserve currency should when DeFi reactivates.

The lesson here is that if you’re interested to learn about a basket currency, pay attention to the total reserve ratio, what currencies are in it, and see that there is enough liquidity of reserves and holder distribution for the basket to make sense. Of course baskets could be memes, but they also have real function. Make sure you take a look into how a basket works and that you have a reason before putting your hard mined, staked, won, or purchased Verus in.

We will need the network to upgrade to version 1.0.6 before we can re-enable DeFi and cross-chain functions, making the ETH bridge launch possible, as well as PBaaS launches and conversions.

We see that someone is launching a currency called “whales”, which looks like an ID registration currency that will enable registering IDs with 3 levels of referrals in a currency that simply collects registration fees, which may start quite reasonably priced and likely get more expensive over time as fees are earned in the basket. The startblock for whales is 2561900, which should happen somewhere around 6:00 UTC on Thursday. That means that if we can upgrade and activate by Tuesday before the meeting, that person would still have time for pre-launch participation by those who would like.

Thanks everyone for upgrading as soon as you are able!

### Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock "id@" '{"unlockatblock": <Unlock block height>}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock "id@" '{"setunlockdelay": <Unlock block delay>}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**

verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
#### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@"
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## v1.0.5
Announcing v1.0.5 - MANDATORY MAINNET UPGRADE WITH DEADLINE TBD BY COMMUNITY (STRAWMAN SUGGESTION MONDAY, MAY 29th, 19:00 UTC)

While preparing the cross-chain VRSC currency launch and as part of continual review, we determined that one numeric function that is used in the cross-chain challenges and is calculated differently for mainnet, due to the original launch that included the deprecated time locked rewards, was incorrect. This had never been hit, as it would have been calculated incorrectly only if multiple chains experienced a challenge of two competing forks, but in that case, it would falsely reject any challenge proof. That would mean cross-chain challenges on mainnet, even though they were fine and fully tested on testnet, could fail and block a bridge until that calculation was made correct and the network upgraded.

Because we have the notification oracle technology, we triggered a rip-cord notification selectively for cross-chain that made all nodes listening to the oracle, which we expect to be near 100%, disallow cross-chain operations without affecting same chain operations. That means that all functions on the Verus network, except launching PBaaS chains or Ethereum bridges are fully functional and unhampered in any way at this time. If someone tries to launch a PBaaS chain while this oracle notification is active, all nodes following the oracle will reject such an action without incident until the notification is removed.

This release, v1.0.5, properly calculates the aptly named “magic number” for each chain, in the correct way on the mainnet network, and as long as the notification is set, is fully compatible with current versions on the network.

Once everyone has had a chance to upgrade to v1.0.5, the network/community should agree to remove the notification from the oracle and allow PBaaS launches without false rejection of cross-chain challenges. Once we do that, and when someone launches a PBaaS chain that issues such a challenge, the network would become incompatible with Verus versions prior to 1.0.5.

From our perspective, we are not aware of urgent efforts to launch a PBaaS chain in the next few days by anyone who cannot wait. All things considered, we believe that we can at least wait until the community discussion on Saturday, and that a strawman deadline would be **Monday, May 29th, at 19:00 UTC** for everyone to have upgraded. If you are urgently wanting to launch a PBaaS chain, have a plan, and are prepared to do so sooner, we invite you to join the community meeting on Saturday at 19:00 UTC and let everyone know.

Having this notification remain in place until removed keeps the network running smoothly as it has been since activation, with all DeFi, multicurrency, and non-cross-chain functions enabled. Since the ETH bridge is undergoing final changes and review, is not quite ready to launch on testnet or mainnet, and will likely require at least a couple days on testnet to finish its review, we do not believe the current notification is hampering or slowing anything or anyone down at this time.
### Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

#### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

#### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

#### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
#### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock "id@" '{"unlockatblock": <Unlock block height>}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock "id@" '{"setunlockdelay": <Unlock block delay>}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


#### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
#### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@"
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## v1.0.4
Announcing v1.0.4 - CRITICAL, NON-MANDATORY MAINNET UPGRADE
THIS UPDATE IS CRITICAL FOR MAINNET DEFI OR CROSSCHAIN WALLET FUNCTIONS, AS IT RECTIFIES POTENTIAL REFUND FAILURES IN EDGE CASES - IT IS NOT REQUIRED FOR MAINNET SYNCHRONIZATION OR MAINNET FUNCTION PAST PBAAS ACTIVATION, BUT IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

DO BE SURE TO UPGRADE TO v1.0.3 OR LATER BEFORE MAY 23, 2023, EXPECTED BLOCK #2549420

FOR CONTINUED TESTNET USE, UPGRADE ASAP

### Mainnet improvements:
* Properly inserts refund addresses in all cases when making DeFi or cross-chain transactions
* Merge mining improvements from @Hellcatz for higher merge mining performance on all platforms and full pool merge mining support when used in combination with @Hellcatz and @Oink70’s SNomp pool improvements
* CLI now defaults to mainnet for all PBaaS chains unless -testnet is specified
* 2 versions of GUI will be released for now, a mainnet and separate testnet version. Full PBaaS support in the wallet will only be for either mainnet or testnet, depending on the version used.
* Extends deprecation height from the previous 20 weeks to 52 weeks

### Testnet fixes/improvements:
* Separate GUI release for testnet
* Refund address fix

This the is last expected and recommended release before the mainnet activation, Tuesday at block #2549420, which will add some pool merge mining improvements. Please make sure you update to v1.0.4 or greater before the activation block.

### On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

#### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

#### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

#### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
#### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock "id@" '{"unlockatblock": <Unlock block height>}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock "id@" '{"setunlockdelay": <Unlock block delay>}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


#### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
#### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@"
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## v1.0.3
Announcing v1.0.3 - MANDATORY MAINNET UPGRADE - HOPEFULLY THE LAST IN A WHILE - ACTIVATION DATE HAS BEEN PUSHED BY 2 DAYS

FOR CONTINUED MAINNET USE, UPGRADE TO v1.0.3 OR LATER BEFORE MAY 23, 2023, EXPECTED BLOCK #2549420

FOR CONTINUED TESTNET USE, UPGRADE ASAP

### Mainnet: fixes:
* Fixes an issue discovered that could have resulted in behavior different than what has been tested in an edge case when mainnet activates

### Testnet fixes/improvements:
* Forgives issues pre-1.0.2 on testnet that were blocking challenge resolution by lacking complete cryptographic proof for cross-chain notarization confirmation

### What’s New
v1.0.3 has extended the API fundrawtransaction to allow Verus Mobile and other applications to easily construct transactions for DeFi conversions and cross-chain operations as well.

We expect at least one more non-mandatory release before the mainnet activation, Tuesday at block #2549420, which will add some pool merge mining improvements. Please make sure you update to v1.0.3 or greater before the activation block.

### Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

#### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

#### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
#### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock "id@" '{"unlockatblock": <Unlock block height>}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock "id@" '{"setunlockdelay": <Unlock block delay>}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


#### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
#### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@"
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

### Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

#### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

#### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

#### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
#### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock "id@" '{"unlockatblock": <Unlock block height>}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock "id@" '{"setunlockdelay": <Unlock block delay>}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


#### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
#### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@"
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## v1.0.1
Announcing v1.0.1 - MANDATORY Mainnet Upgrade, UPGRADE TO v1.0.1 OR LATER IS MANDATORY FOR CONTINUED MAINNET AND TESTNET USE AFTER MAY 21, 2023, EXPECTED BLOCK #2546600

### Issues addressed
In addition to fixing an issue discovered by cautionfun#3236 on the current public testnet, this version also addresses an issue discovered during additional coverage testing in the oracle based, reversible rip-cord implementations to ensure the ability for the network to respond to any unexpected events quickly, safely, and without compromise to decentralization.

### What’s New
In addition to the full PBaaS protocol and all capabilities previously described, version 1.0.1 will also include some new capabilities that were previously not in the PBaaS protocol. The capabilities basically extend the idea of a centralized currency to include the ability to launch temporarily centralized currencies, including those that can issue identities. This is achieved by setting the “endblock” on a centralized currency launch of either a token or liquidity basket, enabling:
  1) Minting of currency on demand by the identity of the currency as part of the `sendcurrency`command.
  2) Burning a liquidity basket currency, but instead of affecting the supply/reserve ratio as normal burns do, the identity of a centralized currency can also burn currency to affect the reserve ratio weights of the currency.
  3) Registering identities on a currency. When an identity is registered on a centralized currency, the fee for the registration is not burned into the currency, but sent directly to the identity of the currency. This is true for token or liquidity basket currencies. For decentralized currencies, fees are burned, which on a liquidity basket, puts them into the liquidity pool for all LPs to share in earnings, and for a standard token, reduces the supply and available future registrations on that currency.
  4) In v1.0.1, setting the endblock of a centralized currency causes all centralized capabilities of the same ID to end, converting it in whatever state it currently is in a decentralized currency with no special control over it after that occurs by any identity on the network.
  5) v1.0.0 did not allow a decentralized non-liquidity token to register identities. v1.0.1 does.

Thanks to ejuliano#8606 for suggesting the initial idea that led to the realization that these features could be added quite easily and with very little protocol risk. All of these new capabilities have had full coverage testing and validation over the past week thanks to @Asherda’s leadership on that front.

Meanwhile, @alexenglish, @monkins1010, @asherda, quipacorn#5205, and others have been working on the Ethereum bridge deployment in preparation for this release. The testnet will transition to the v1.0.1 protocol with no reset required, Monday, May 8, 2023 4:00:00 PM, UTC.
### Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

#### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

#### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

#### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
#### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


#### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
#### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@"
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

```Announcing v1.0.1 - MANDATORY Mainnet Upgrade, UPGRADE TO v1.0.1 OR LATER IS MANDATORY FOR CONTINUED MAINNET AND TESTNET USE AFTER MAY 21, 2023, EXPECTED BLOCK #2546600

### Issues addressed
In addition to fixing an issue discovered by cautionfun#3236 on the current public testnet, this version also addresses an issue discovered during additional coverage testing in the oracle based, reversible rip-cord implementations to ensure the ability for the network to respond to any unexpected events quickly, safely, and without compromise to decentralization.

### What’s New
In addition to the full PBaaS protocol and all capabilities previously described, version 1.0.1 will also include some new capabilities that were previously not in the PBaaS protocol. The capabilities basically extend the idea of a centralized currency to include the ability to launch temporarily centralized currencies, including those that can issue identities. This is achieved by setting the “endblock” on a centralized currency launch of either a token or liquidity basket, enabling:
  1) Minting of currency on demand by the identity of the currency as part of the `sendcurrency`command.
  2) Burning a liquidity basket currency, but instead of affecting the supply/reserve ratio as normal burns do, the identity of a centralized currency can also burn currency to affect the reserve ratio weights of the currency.
  3) Registering identities on a currency. When an identity is registered on a centralized currency, the fee for the registration is not burned into the currency, but sent directly to the identity of the currency. This is true for token or liquidity basket currencies. For decentralized currencies, fees are burned, which on a liquidity basket, puts them into the liquidity pool for all LPs to share in earnings, and for a standard token, reduces the supply and available future registrations on that currency.
  4) In v1.0.1, setting the endblock of a centralized currency causes all centralized capabilities of the same ID to end, converting it in whatever state it currently is in a decentralized currency with no special control over it after that occurs by any identity on the network.
  5) v1.0.0 did not allow a decentralized non-liquidity token to register identities. v1.0.1 does.

Thanks to ejuliano#8606 for suggesting the initial idea that led to the realization that these features could be added quite easily and with very little protocol risk. All of these new capabilities have had full coverage testing and validation over the past week thanks to @Asherda’s leadership on that front.

Meanwhile, @alexenglish, @monkins1010, @asherda, quipacorn#5205, and others have been working on the Ethereum bridge deployment in preparation for this release. The testnet will transition to the v1.0.1 protocol with no reset required, Monday, May 8, 2023 4:00:00 PM, UTC.
# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@"
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## v1.0.0
Announcing v1.0.0 - PBaaS Mainnet Upgrade, UPGRADE TO v1.0.0-x MANDATORY FOR CONTINUED MAINNET AND TESTNET USE AFTER MAY 21, 2023, EXPECTED BLOCK #2546600

### What’s New
This release delivers on every part of the vision (and most stretch goals) either described in the vision paper of June 2018 or ever planned for the PBaaS release. Thanks to the incredible combined efforts of so many people in the community ranging from development, companies and projects joining and their open contributions (Valu/Arkeytyp, CHIPS, vDEX, VaultAlert, cragslist, and more) to community members supporting users to helping educate others who can contribute as well, we have run these protocols now for years as we’ve improved them, and all of these capabilities will go live on the Verus mainnet May 21, 2023, with the activation expected targeting block 2546600.

As a community, we’ve discussed what the Verus PBaaS protocol can do for years. Now that it has existed on testnet for as long as it has, only those who have either been part of those conversations or experienced it first hand have a real sense for how much better Verus PBaaS is as a solution for cross-chain, DeFi AMMs, decentralized markets, self-sovereign provable recoverable IDs, NFT capabilities, anti-phishing, anti-MEV, scale, or just about any of the challenges people have on crypto platforms today. In fact, as we prepare for activation of this protocol that enables so many new use cases for crypto, not to mention easy onboarding when entrepreneurs discover how to really leverage VerusIDs, PBaaS is so far beyond what people are experiencing on any crypto platform today that it has been easy to dismiss our community as describing the impossible.

Once we are live on mainnet and people can actually use all of this themselves, along with every project, chain and currency on the PBaaS network and EVERY ERC20 or ERC721 on Ethereum or even bridged to Ethereum, the truth of Verus will be self-evident, and those who build on Verus will more easily build faster, better, more secure apps and services with the possibility of provable identity + privacy, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts all seamlessly integrated into UIs that do not need business deals, permission, or any centralized infrastructure to connect services and users, enabling everyone to communicate in provable, private, or public ways that always include bidirectional, secure commerce of all kinds.

This core capabilities of this release include (lots to learn to understand it all, but here’s a partial list):

1) **Mainnet PBaaS Activation MAY 21, 2023, EXPECTED BLOCK #2546600**: v1.0.0 is MANDATORY, meaning that you will need to upgrade to this release or a later version v1.0.0-x, before MAY 21, 2023 to stay reliably connected to mainnet. Testnet will also be reset within the next day, and this release will allow you to connect to the new testnet, which we see as a core development platform and staging area for the Verus PBaaS network and have no plans to reset in any foreseeable future.

2) **Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP) - Layer 0 Multichain and Inter-chain Protocol**: To our knowledge, the VIP protocol is the only fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology available on any network that is based on cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state. From what we’ve been able to learn about LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, Thorchain or others, VIP is different from (though closest in some ways to LayerZero), superior to, and more decentralized than all other cross-chain protocols we have seen. We can of course get into any level of discussion on the topic, but expect more descriptions and educational material to follow, now that the protocol was originally conceived of 5 years ago, and has been developed and tested/hardened for years.

3) **VerusID Content Multimaps - Unlimited Provable Data for Every VerusID**: With the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs gain a powerful new capability that can be used for social networking, voting, oracles, publishing any information, various forms of provable attestations, ratings, and much, much more. With the scalability of PBaaS and VerusID content multimaps together, the Verus PBaaS network becomes the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world. We don’t believe anything else even comes close, and with the recent rise of AI, it feels great to have this come together as a core original goal at a very appropriate and important time in history.

4) **Permissionless Chain, Token, and Liquidity Basket Currency Launches**: Whether you are looking to crowdfund an effort in a manner much like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, sell identities to which you expect to add value or that are sub-IDs of a very cool root ID, or launch an entirely new blockchain economy and blockchain that starts with all of the Verus technology and a bridge to Verus and Ethereum from day 1, Verus is probably the best platform for you. In fact, as we were planning for the next testnet and wanted to have our own version of DAI to use in the bridge, since we want only decentralized currencies in the live mainnet bridge, we used a command to launch a token on the old testnet, exported it and all its supply to Ethereum’s Goerli on the existing bridge, and that will be the DAI proxy/simulant that we will use on the new testnet. It saved us all some time, proving that Verus PBaaS will also be the easiest, most efficient way to launch even an Ethereum ERC20, whether that ERC20 represents a token, DeFi basket, or even another PBaaS blockchain 🙂


5) **Decentralized Ethereum Bridge**: Shortly after PBaaS activates on mainnet, the Ethereum bridge will launch as a decentralized gateway and 1:1 provably mapped currency called “vETH” on the Verus network, also available to all PBaaS chains. The Ethereum bridge will also include a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI, which will have the following functions:
Auto conversion of fees from Verus <-> Ethereum when sending cross chain, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket
Permissionless ability to register *.vETH IDs, which in addition to the normal sub-ID capability of creating a single token that has control over the ID and can be exported to Ethereum as an automatic ERC721 NFT, can alternately be used to create a “mapped currency”, which can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network by exporting it to the vETH bridge. Only Verus root IDs, and IDs of a gateway can create mapped currencies to a gateway.
Decentralized, fair bridge launch. The vETH bridge will launch as other currencies, chains, and gateways can launch, including the bridge converter. When the bridge launches, the contracts will have a surplus of Verus that comes from the fees paid to launch the gateway. In the protocol, that surplus is first used to solve the chicken and egg problem of none of one currency on the other chain. The contracts will cover the Verus fees for all sends from Ethereum before the Bridge converter launches, the liquidity basket becomes active, and the bridge recognizes that launch. Once that happens, the remainder of ½ the fees (5000 VRSC) that are left over from the launch and did not go to miners and stakers or pay Verus fees for people sending from Ethereum

6) **The Verus Fee Pool and Rewards**: Another technology and solution unique to Verus, the Verus Fee Pool technology goes live with PBaaS. What this means is that as people use the cross-chain, DeFi, or purchase/register IDs on the network, the miner or staker will put all fees into the on-chain “fee pool”, and then take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward. This gives everyone incentive to still prioritize transactions based on fees, while preventing validators from gaming the fee system by washing fees-in vs. fees-out or working to reorg/rewind to capture a particularly juicy block reward. Instead, this technology aligns all validator incentives with the health/proper operation of the network and creates a circular on-chain economy that can last well beyond block rewards.

For those who actually understand the challenges actual users have in crypto today, this release represents a historic move forward in public cryptographic networks and credibly and actually neutral infrastructure for society-wide human and AI collaboration and learning. As a community, this version really does realize the vision laid out in the original Verus Vision Paper, and at the same time provides much more than was described there. We are a community of individuals, and it is only because that is what we are that we have all arrived here together. The rest of the world is stuck on their Munchausen’s protocols, trying to figure out how to share the front-running and back-running spoils taken from users, but Verus activation gives them a better path forward.

As always, we do not promise, we describe a vision and welcome contributors from everywhere. Now that we, as a community, have delivered on the original phases of the vision together, it is time for all of us to consider what we might want to build over this incredible, geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform. Our next efforts across the community should be to realize the promise of this network in the use cases we create, use cases that we will have an advantage creating on Verus over any other platform because it really is that much better.

### Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

#### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

#### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

#### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
#### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


#### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
#### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@"
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## v0.9.9-5
Announcing v0.9.9-5 - CRITICAL PRIVACY FIX PARSING FRIENDLY PRIVATE NAMES, CRITICAL UPDATE FOR RELIABLE TESTNET OPERATION

### Mainnet Changes - Wallet Hardening
v0.9.9-5 Fixes an issue introduced in v0.9.9 during the ID name hardening work that prevented parsing id@:private to the z-address of id@ when running a native node. Instead, such an address parsed to the main id@. Since this issue could impact on-chain privacy of someone intending to send to or from a private address and using friendly names, we are considering this a critical privacy release.

This version also prevents the wallet from crediting transactions that can be constructed to make a burn look like a spendable output, ensuring that unspendable funds are not added to a wallet or address balance. @Alrighttt, who has been focusing on Verus security testing, reported a way that someone might create such an output, and we appreciate that it is before we have ever seen such transactions on the public or test networks. Thanks @Alrighttt for the report and discretion that helps keep them off the network(s) altogether! We recommend that everyone update as soon as possible to version 0.9.9-5 or later.

We are working towards the mainnet PBaaS upgrade version 1.0.0, but we cannot put a specific date beyond 🔜 on its release.

### What’s New for TestNet
This release fixes hopefully the last remaining issue that was causing testnet users to experience sync issues on PBaaS chains.

There are no other significant changes.

### Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

#### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

#### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
#### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


#### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@"
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## v0.9.9-4
Announcing v0.9.9-4 - RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET, MANDATORY UPDATE FOR RELIABLE TESTNET OPERATION

### Mainnet Changes
Low level stakeguard improvements, no functional changes

### What’s New for TestNet
This release fixes an issue that was causing testnet users to experience sync issues on chains that had more than one oracle upgrade for the same capability activated.

There are no other significant changes.

### Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

#### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

#### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

#### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
#### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


#### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
#### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@"
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## v0.9.9-3
Announcing v0.9.9-3 - FULLY OPTIONAL UPDATE FOR MAINNET, MANDATORY UPDATE FOR CONTINUED TESTNET OPERATION

### Mainnet Changes - no protocol changes
V0.9.9-3 introduces the `prunespentwallettransactions` CLI command and RPC API, providing a method for holders on testnet or mainnet of very large wallets to prune older spent transactions, which can improve performance for wallets that may be slowing down due to size. Thanks @Himu007 for the PR! There are no mainnet protocol changes in v0.9.9-3 over the prior release.

### What’s New for TestNet
This release includes an activation that allows a major upgrade to the testnet Ethereum bridge contracts that is both not expected to be needed again on testnet and not ever needed on mainnet with the new contract upgrade model. This upgrade should clear all known issues on the bridge to Goerli, meaning any remaining bridge transactions will be delivered, and the ETH bridge should then be fully functional.

### The Path for PBaaS to Mainnet
This testnet has actually been through a lot already, more than we expected before mainnet, and this last experience, along with its full restoration of cross-chain and all function has been very useful and was the impetus for the Verus Oracle Notification technology. In the process of getting here, we implemented the necessary changes and fixes to get everything back on track, but we also have remnants of these events in the daemon, and on the final protocol, these are there to enable compatibility with the history of testnet, not because we need these upgrades on mainnet PBaaS. It gave us experience, increased confidence, and pushed us to develop a fast, decentralized network response capability. At the same time, it would be best for our code base, both on the Verus side and in the ETH contracts if that testnet history is removed from the code before mainnet activation. Doing so would make the next upgrade incompatible with today’s testnet and its earlier history.

As a result, we have decided that we will create one final testnet, but this time, we would do it a little differently than in the past. We will extend the pre-PBaaS upgrade on the existing testnet to a future date via the oracles. If you have started a chain and control the default oracle on any chain, please check the #pbaas-development channel for instructions on setting your oracle to extend the upgrade.

We will leave the current testnet running and fully functional, as we prepare the next release, which we expect to be ready for a mainnet PBaaS activation. We will effectively abandon this testnet and leave it running long enough to overlap with the next and final testnet instance before PBaaS release. You should be able to actually send currencies over from the first testnet to the second via Ethereum’s Goerli testnet, even map some VRSCTEST-CLASSIC or something else through the bridge, but we do not intend to update that daemon again, or continue to run nodes or notaries on the old test network for more than a couple weeks after the new testnet goes live.

Thanks for all your help and contributions, both already made and those to come for this historic upcoming release!


### Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

#### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

#### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

#### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
#### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


#### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@"
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## v0.9.9-2
Announcing v0.9.9-2 - CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE FOR MAINNET AND REQUIRED UPDATE TO RESUME SUCCESSFUL MERGE MINING NOTARIZATION ON TESTNET

#### Important Mainnet Security Updates**
v0.9.9-2 introduces new mitigation code for the **Rab13s** vulnerability, announced by Halbourne 3 days ago as a zero day vulnerability in over 280 blockchains, including Zcash and Verus, that could allow someone to attack and bring down specific nodes that they may target through exhausting the node’s resources. The Verus fix adapts a fix implemented in Zcash that also does a better job of preserving privacy while gossiping transactions around the network by making it harder to track their node of origin via listening nodes.

This release also includes an important update of the OpenSSL library, which Verus uses for encrypted node connections and addresses a buffer overflow vulnerability in that library.

#### What’s New for TestNet
This release re-enables cross-chain notarization, and represents the completion of a great deal of learning from the first roll out of auto notarization. Basically, we encountered two issues:

1) There was a notarization bug in a significantly updated approach that caused notarizations to fork, effectively simulating a worst case, unmitigated attack on the notarization system. While that did not cause the system to fail per se, it resulted in the generation of many perceived, although not real, notarization forks on the network.

2) Due to our effort to err on the side of more evidence than we believed was sufficient with auto notarization, then optimize to reduce the proofs required, the protocol was simply taking too long and generating too large proofs to be reasonable, required, or what we need on mainnet in any real scenario.

As a result, we will take a few days to change some parameters in the auto notarization protocol that will both reduce the total and maximum amount of proof required, as well as provide a sufficient level of cryptographic proof, similar in strength to the current proof model with more efficient and selective proof choices. We don’t expect this important step to take long, and until then, we will leave testnet on the pre-PBaaS to mainnet preparatory state.

The good news is that since we have the new Verus Notification Oracle technology, we can enable everyone running on the current testnet to remain connected as all cross-chain transactions to and from PBaaS chains will resume flowing. We are still seeing an error in BridgeKeeper, but since this release includes a mainnet security update and addresses all other known issues on testnet, we’ll release this immediately and update Bridgekeeper as soon as possible. In order to merge mine PBaaS chains with Verus or the Ethereum bridge to Goerli going forward, you will need to update to v0.9.9-2, which everyone should run for mainnet anyhow.

Once you update, please feel free to resume merge mining all PBaaS chains and Verus. You will need to wait for the BridgeKeeper update to be able to merge mine and stake with Ethereum’s Goerli.

Thanks for all your testing! We’ve learned a great deal from this upgrade, and although it may feel like a delay that we took the time to learn and address it in place on the public network before moving on, this learning and consequent hardening will ensure the mainnet release will be more hardened than ever. Next steps are to upgrade auto notarization to be resilient to anything like this level of buildup over weeks automatically and prepare the mainnet release. Join us in testing everything in the #pbaas-development channel. Contribute as you learn and build, and let's all make history together!
### Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

#### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

#### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

#### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
#### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


#### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
#### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@"
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## v0.9.9-1
Announcing v0.9.9-1, MANDATORY FOR TESTNET, no mainnet changes

This release implements a fix for communication with BridgeKeeper for the Testnet Goerli Ethereum Bridge, as well as edge-case notarization improvements. We need every testnet participant to upgrade to this version as soon as possible to resume notarizations for the ETH bridge and the pbaas chains. Once enough people upgrade, the testnet upgrade can be broadcasted via oracle and we can get closer to getting pbaas on mainnet.

Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

#### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

#### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

#### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
#### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


#### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
#### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@",
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## v0.9.9
Announcing v0.9.9 - PBaaS Mainnet Preparation Release, MANDATORY FOR MAINNET AND CONTINUED TESTNET USE

### What’s New
There is so much new and important in v0.9.9, and we are so close to the mainnet PBaaS release that this is a hard announcement to keep to a digestible size. Key points:

1. **Preparing for #LaunchPBaaS**: v0.9.9 is MANDATORY, meaning that you will need to upgrade to this release ASAP to stay reliably connected to mainnet after the first preparatory PBaaS upgrade is triggered, both for testnet and mainnet. While the current deadline for being upgraded is in 1 week, it is a soft fork that we would like to activate as soon as possible, and if we can believe that we have more than 50% of the validating network updated earlier than 1 week, we will trigger the activation with our Oracle Notification Technology described in 2. **(Mainnet + Testnet)**

2. **Enabling Seamless Decentralized Network Upgrades**: This release includes a Verus invention of consensus-capable oracle notifications built into the core protocol, which enable dynamic coordinated consensus changes that can be triggered at a time decided after the actual release which enables them, all without any compromise on decentralization. The Verus Community may decide that we are ready to go earlier than one week on this upgrade and activate it, even before its scheduled time. The good news is that this first test upgrade will primarily affect testnet and prepare for the mainnet PBaaS upgrade, so it is a perfect test case for a mainnet test run before we #LaunchPBaaS. This release actually has the ability to upgrade mainnet to PBaaS, but we believe it is prudent to have at least some time on this new protocol on testnet before the v1.0 release, which will upgrade mainnet. If we make no additional changes to the protocol in this release, which we do not intend to do at this time, this version may be able to follow the v1.0 upgrade. If we determine that it cannot, the oracle upgrade technology will enable the daemon to recognize that it is not capable and request that the user upgrade to a newer version without requiring a bootstrap for the upgrade. **(Mainnet + Testnet)**

3. **This upgrade fixes all known testnet issues with no reset**: Using v0.9.9, you should be able to sync fully and resume all cross-chain operations on the Verus test network, if you were not able to perform cross-chain operations or sync to the network on the prior version. As mentioned, someone seems to have mined with an intermediate version along the way on testnet and made the network unavailable without a bootstrap on the older daemon. This version should fix that issue as well as any cross-chain difficulties. Auto-notarization will be enabled on testnet in sync when the testfork executes. Until then, all witnessed cross-chain operations should be able to resume, if they have had difficulty. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**

4. **Bridging Blockchain Networks Without Witnesses**: v0.9.9 is the first release of any blockchain protocol anywhere that we know of which enables cryptographically provable, cross-chain bridging across Verus and all PBaaS and other connected blockchains in the network, either combined with or independent of the need for notary witnesses. With notary witnesses, cross-chain transactions complete faster, but they are also checked against cryptographic evidence, making it difficult to impossible for anyone, including notary witnesses to take any action, even colluding with validators that would go against the wishes of the most chain power. We have been referring to this new cross-chain consensus technology as “auto-notarization”, as that is what it actually is, but it would also be accurate to call it Proof of Proof of Power, as that is how it works. For purposes of ensuring everyone understands the state of the technology, it is fully functional and we have taken great care to ensure it is sufficiently secure, but we have not yet had the protocol proven to an academic standard. Because of that, while it provides a security fall-back against misbehaving notary witnesses and will be fully functional and we believe sufficiently secure without notary witnesses on release, we currently recommend toconsider the protocol unproven at this time and that any serious PBaaS chains be launched with operational notary witnesses until further notice.

   Using `“notarizationprotocol”:1`, which is also the default, a chain launch can specify notary witnesses that will be used when they do their job. Even if they stop witnessing for any reason, the protocol will fail-over to auto-notarization, ensuring that cross-chain transactions still function as expected, even if just for people to move their assets to another blockchain, although significantly more slowly and based solely on cryptographic proof and challenge resolution between merge miners and stakers. This cross-chain proof and challenge protocol operates even when witnesses are also operating and if miners and stakers continue to prove a more powerful chain than the one witnesses represent, the most powerful chain can still be confirmed. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**

5. **Expanding L1 VerusID APIs**: This release provides a major enhancement to the identity content multimap support with two new APIs, `getidentityhistory` and `getidentitycontent` that provide real-time mempool access and also introduce self-sovereign delete operations to identity content that can be used by applications, making it easy for applications to index, organize, and aggregate an unlimited amount of user content referenced by an identity and made available to the application. This is the technology we used for oracle upgrade notifications, as all of this is available at L1, making it possible to imagine future protocols that can deal smoothly with diverse community opinions worldwide, but always respect the sovereignty and decisions of all members on the network. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**

6. **Introducing Restricted VerusID Staking for PBaaS Chains**: This release enables the stretch goal of restricted ID staking as an option for launching PBaaS chains. This option means that on such a PBaaS chain, only funds controlled by IDs with a parent of that PBaaS chain may stake blocks on that chain. When combined with restricted forms of ID issuance, whether approval or referral required and/or referral rewards, this capability opens up an entire new area for public/private blockchains and applications, as well as government, voting security, corporate, or organizational use cases.**(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**
### Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

#### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

#### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

#### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
### Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
#### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


#### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
#### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

#### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@",
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
#### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

This release contains a critical update for the Verus daemon. This version does not support testnet, but a future version will be released shortly to support it. For more information on running testnet, please refer to the previous release or the next one.
# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@",
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

## Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

## Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

v0.9.6-1, RECOMMENDED UPDATE FOR MAINNET, CRITICAL FOR CONTINUED TESTNET AND ETHEREUM BRIDGE (GOERLI) USE

**What’s New**
THERE IS NO TESTNET RESET, AND ALL OTHER NOTES REMAIN THE SAME AS LAST RELEASE.

**v0.9.6-1 has no mainnet changes and fixes the following testnet issues:**
- Fault when initiating mining and staking on a small number of machines
- Sync from scratch issues on testnet

This release fixes all reported issues in all community testing. There are no protocol changes, and no known changes required. All network functions should work as intended.

## Verus PBaaS and DeFi RC6 - BUG BOUNTIES
At this time, we are not aware of any bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross chain protocols on this version of testnet. We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all of the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release. While we don’t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people (3 still unclaimed) who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended. If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.

If you have reported a bug, since the bounties for the 0.9.5+ versions were announced, you are on the list, and someone from the Foundation will reach out to you in the near future.

The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the #pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for mainnet release this coming week, and start building your vision today!


## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@",
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

## Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

## Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# Announcing v0.9.6, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED UPDATE FOR MAINNET, MANDATORY FOR NEW, RESET TESTNET AND ETHEREUM BRIDGE (GOERLI) USE
v0.9.6 RESETS TESTNET AND COMPLETES ALL PROTOCOL UPDATES FEATURES AND CAPABILITIES EXPECTED FOR THE MAINNET PBAAS UPGRADE. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY NEAR TERM PLAN FOR ANOTHER TESTNET RESET AFTER THE v0.9.6 UPGRADE.

IF YOU HAVE USED TESTNET WITH VERSIONS PRIOR TO v0.9.6, MAKE SURE TO DELETE AND CLEAR ANY EXISTING TESTNET DATA FOLDERS AS DESCRIBED IN THE RELEASE NOTES LINKED BELOW.

## What’s New
### For mainnet, v0.9.6 fixes the following issues:

- An error in fee calculation that can result in nodes having difficulty accepting large, complex transactions with many z-outputs into their mempools.
- Marketplace offers were not showing up properly under getoffers.
- When using the `-privatechange` wallet option with a private change address, attempts to make marketplace offers could fail.

### For testnet, v0.9.6 adds the following:
- Caching and performance improvements for advanced PBaaS functions, providing enough performance to keep high transaction bandwidth and/or cross-chain throughput under load for each chain.
- Most hardening required for the mainnet release.
-  **The Verus/Ethereum Bridge!** v0.9.6 includes the upgraded Ethereum bridge to the Goerli testnet live with all bridgekeeping, Ethereum Gas price tracking, and reward incentive capabilities for miners and stakers. Rewards for bridgekeeping are delivered both on Verus and on the Ethereum blockchain. Access the Ethereum bridge website (https://ethtest.verus.services) to move over some Goerli Ethereum or USDC, and participate in the Bridge.vETH liquidity basket launch to hold and earn fees on a basket with vETH, USDC, and VRSCTEST used as the fee converter for all cross chain transactions between Ethereum’s Goerli and VRSC testnets.


v0.9.6 also includes support for new parameters `-arbitragecurrencies=[“VRSCTEST”,”vETH”]` and `-arbitrageaddress=valid R-address, pubkey, or ID`. They’re exciting, but don’t try to use them just yet. They are for testing right now, and are preparing for an “auto-arbitrage” feature already supported in the protocol, but which we hope to have in the daemon before mainnet PBaaS activation that combines decentralized on-chain marketplace offers for currency with liquidity basket import processing to provide miners and stakers the opportunity to commit some amount of funds from their node wallet in common currencies to spot and leverage guaranteed arbitrage opportunities when making a block. These opportunities arise between orders on chain and liquidity basket pricing that if leveraged to earn, actually result in P2P crowdsourcing of liquidity for all baskets across the network, both from the blockchain itself as well as miners and stakers, while benefiting all participants in the following ways:
- Miners and stakers can capture guaranteed arbitrage opportunities and arbitrage with any currency that they choose from their wallets.
- Blockchain users can set limit orders and have them filled if they are near the market price for a currency, or if the market moves in their direction.
- LPs and users of liquidity baskets for conversion get as close to market prices as possible on their conversions, never releasing funds from a basket before an on-chain, MEV-resistant auction takes place for the pricing of those assets.

Although this release is likely to be robust enough for a mainnet, we have come this far with quality and will not rush for a few days earlier upgrade. We still plan to review and complete a small number of hardening items before PBaaS 1.0 is ready for its mainnet release.

That said, this release fixes all reported issues in all community testing. Community developers, including myself are grateful for all of the testing many have contributed to to date. It has made it possible to get incredible test coverage across all network capabilities, and we appreciate all of your participation and pushing of boundaries. This release is expected to be the final PBaaS protocol that will be released on mainnet. There are no known changes required, and all functions should work as intended.

The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the #pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for mainnet release in the next couple weeks and start building your vision today!

## Verus PBaaS and DeFi RC6 - BUG BOUNTIES
At this time, we are not aware of any bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross chain protocols on this version of testnet. We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release. While we don’t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people (7 still unclaimed) who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended. If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@",
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

## Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

## Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

 Announcing v0.9.5-2, RECOMMENDED UPDATE FOR MAINNET - CRITICAL FOR CONTINUED TESTNET USE

YOU MUST BE UPDATED TO v0.9.5 OR LATER BY BLOCK 2291830, AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 PM UTC, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 19th, 2022 TO RELIABLY STAY SYNCHRONIZED TO THE VERUS MAINNET. WHILE THERE MAY BE A MAINNET PBAAS UPGRADE BEFORE THAT DATE, WE RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT UPGRADED YET, THAT YOU DO SO NOW.

As with all v0.9.5-* releases, this release updates the Komodo notaries to season 6, with an activation height of 2291830, at approximately 11:00 PM UTC, Saturday, November 19th, 2022.

## What’s New
For mainnet, this release labels spendable transactions for the getaddressutxos RPC API, which is used by Verus Mobile. This update is critical for users that have not upgraded to v0.9.5+ before block 2291830.

For testnet, v0.9.5-2 introduces minor notarization fixes that will be important for those intending to launch and witness PBaaS chains.

## Ethereum Bridge
Although its deployment has been delayed, there are no technical blockers, and we still expect the Ethereum bridge to be brought back up on the new Verus testnet within the next day or two. When it is up, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services/, and use your metamask to convert or send cross-chain to the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.

The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for the imminent mainnet release of the PBaaS upgrade and start building your vision today!
## Verus PBaaS and DeFi RC5 - BUG BOUNTIES
At this time, we are not aware of any bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross chain protocols on this version of testnet. We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all of the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release. While we don’t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people (7 still unclaimed) who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended. If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@",
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

## Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

## Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

Announcing v0.9.5-1, CRITICAL UPDATE FOR MAINNET MANDATORY FOR CONTINUED TESTNET USE

As with the last release, this release updates the Komodo notaries to season 6, with an activation height of 2291830, at approximately 11:00 PM UTC, Saturday, November 19th, 2022. YOU MUST BE UPDATED TO v0.9.5 OR LATER BY THEN TO RELIABLY STAY SYNCHRONIZED TO THE VERUS MAINNET. WHILE THERE MAY BE A MAINNET PBAAS UPGRADE BEFORE THAT DATE, WE RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT UPGRADED YET, THAT YOU DO SO NOW.

Please make sure that if you do choose to wait for the possibility of a mainnet PBaaS upgrade before this activation that you do upgrade to the latest release before Saturday, November 19th.


## What’s New
For mainnet, this release has no material changes over v0.9.5, but is still considered critical, as mainnet users should be upgraded to v0.9.5+ before block 2291830.

For testnet, v0.9.5-1 fixes an issue discovered on testnet where duplicate ID exports blocked cross-chain processing temporarily and also introduces a protocol improvement designed to make the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol even more resistant than what we believe was already the leading algorithm to multi-block attempts at MEV. The protocol change makes the following adjustments:

Conversions and cross-chain transfers still roll-up into exports that are collected from one or more blocks of transfer transactions, but to determine when a block is the last of the prior export or first in the next requires a random bit pulled from later blocks.
The last miner or staker to complete a block of an export retroactively receives 10% of all fees from processing that export, including all conversions, once the rollup is processed as an import. This reward used to go to the miner or staker who processes the export, which is no longer the case.
Import transactions can now include up to n/2 arbitrage transactions, where n is the number of reserves in a liquidity basket currency.

These changes together serve to disincentivize any miner or staker from attempting to exclude a large set of transactions from a block and front run all of them, as they will have an even chance of having all of those excluded transactions put back in with their transaction, turning potential gain into potential loss. They would be better off saving their working capital to arbitrage imports by joining transactions, bringing them close to market, and earning money without risk of loss. In addition, if they do end up putting more value of transactions in a block that caps the export rollup, they will reliably earn meaningful rewards without risk of loss in that way as well.

## Ethereum Bridge
Although its deployment has been delayed, we expect the Ethereum bridge to be brought back up on the new Verus testnet within the next day or two. When it is up, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services, and use your metamask to convert or send cross-chain to the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.

The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the #pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for mainnet release in the next couple weeks and start building your vision today!

## Verus PBaaS and DeFi RC5 - BUG BOUNTIES
At this time, we are not aware of any bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross chain protocols on this version of testnet. We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all of the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release. While we don’t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people (7 still unclaimed) who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended. If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [
    1
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@",
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [
    380228.12033701,
    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```
### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

## Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

## Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# Announcing v0.9.5, CRITICAL UPDATE FOR MAINNET AND TESTNET

This release updates the Komodo notaries to season 6, with an activation height of 2291830, at approximately 11:00 PM UTC, Saturday, November 19th, 2022. You must be updated to v0.9.5 or later by that time to reliably stay synchronized to the Verus mainnet. We are also working to get a mandatory update release during these next couple weeks, which will have the Verus PBaaS mainnet upgrade finalized as well. If you would prefer to wait for the PBaaS mainnet upgrade and upgrade once, we cannot guarantee that the PBaaS mainnet release will be available in the next couple weeks, but we are working to make that a reasonable choice as well. Please make sure that if you do choose to wait to upgrade that you do upgrade to the latest release before Saturday, November 19th.


## New Signature Capabilities on Mainnet & Testnet
In addition to continued support for all of the `signmessage`, `signdata`, and `signfile` APIs, as well as their verify* counterparts, v0.9.5 introduces 2 new APIs and CLI commands, `signdata` and `verifysignature`, that encompass all of the capabilities of previous signing and verification APIs and add new capabilities for advanced signatures and verification. These new advanced capabilities were designed for community work by @allbits, designing a more powerful and flexible framework for NFTs and ID-bound legal rights and agreements. In addition to digital signing of documents or information using an ID, the new APIs enable easily binding together multiple sources of content, documents, identities, and VDXF keys together into one verifiable signature and then being able to verify that signature, including all of its specific bindings.

## Verus PBaaS and DeFi RC5 - BUG BOUNTIES
At this time, we are not aware of any bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross chain protocols on this version of testnet. We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all of the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release. While we don’t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended. If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.

## Emoji IDs and 🎃Chain
In the spirit of this release day, we have taken advantage of VerusIDs and currency emoji support and created a new, merge mineable PBaaS chain, 🎃. It has been said that those who merge mine 🎃chain at midnight will disappear into the crypto-metaverse, never to be seen again, become VerusID avatars, and be forever doomed to being bought and sold on the VRSCTEST marketplace for all eternity (or until the next testnet reset). YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

We expect the Ethereum bridge to be brought back up on the new Verus testnet within the next day or two. When it is up, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services, and use your metamask to convert or send cross-chain to the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.

The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the #pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for mainnet release in the next couple weeks and start building your vision today!

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`
### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**

```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain

### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

Announcing v0.9.4-5, RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET AND TESTNET

This release fixes an RPC API issue on mainnet and testnet that can cause a daemon fault when the getaddressmempool API is used. This fault while running is only caused by non-typical API, insight explorer, or CLI use, but if it does happen, may result in the need to rescan or resync your wallet. We know of no one on mainnet affected by this issue. We recommend that all users upgrade.

This release also includes a new capability for testnet, which was pioneered by CHIPS developer @Biz, who worked to modify and test the Verus PoP algorithm to support 10 second block times, which the CHIPS chain uses to enable its game application focus. These new parameters will enable the CHIPS blockchain to move to being an interoperable, merge mineable PBaaS chain with a 10 second blocktime when PBaaS goes live on mainnet. To learn how to test the new CHIPS test chain on testnet, visit the #pbaas-development channel, as the support in v0.9.4-5 is not as complete as it will be in the next and hopefully final testnet reset. In that next version, blocktime and the pow averaging window for any PBaaS chain’s PoP consensus will be able to be configured between 10 seconds and 2 minutes in addition to its notarization frequency as part of the chain definition, enabling a greater variety of PBaaS use cases, transaction throughput, and application capabilities.

As a reminder, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services , using your metamask, converting or sending cross chain through the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.

The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the #pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for mainnet and start building your vision today!

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```json
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain

### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

Announcing v0.9.4-4, UNCHANGED FOR MAINNET -- RECOMMENDED FOR CONTINUED TESTNET USE, MANDATORY FOR CONTINUED TESTNET MERGE OR BRIDGE MINING

This release has no material mainnet changes.

This release primarily upgrades the ETH bridge and also fixes a PBaaS cross-chain notarization issue that made miners and stakers consider themselves ineligible to enter cross-chain notarizations. There are no actual protocol changes.

The ETH bridge upgrade introduces the ability to enter notarizations between Ethereum Goerli and VRSCTEST using bridgekeeper without an Ethereum private key in your conf file. This will enable you to still mine and potentially earn by agreeing or disagreeing with notarizations mined into the Verus blockchain, without needing to make transactions on or spend Ethereum for fees. This should also work with a free Infura account.

As a reminder, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services , using your metamask, converting or sending cross chain through the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.

The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. Drop by the #pbaas-development channel to help us prepare for mainnet and start building your vision today!

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```json
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell

```



### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

Announcing v0.9.4-3, UNCHANGED FOR MAINNET -- MANDATORY FOR CONTINUED TESTNET USE

This release has no material mainnet changes.

This release upgrades the testnet protocol to fix an issue with the Ethereum bridge and VRSCTEST mining and staking. Please update to v0.9.4-3 to continue mining and staking on testnet and the Ethereum bridge. This version also fixes an issue discovered when defining Ethereum NFT mapped tokens, which are not yet supported in the released Ethereum contracts, but are updated no in the daemon and ready to use when the contracts are upgraded, hopefully in the next few days.

NFT mapped tokens will allow you to define an Ethereum NFT as the token that controls revoke and recover for an ID. Similar to how you can define a token for tokenized ID control, an NFT mapped token, when defined, refers by contract and tokenid to a specific NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Once defined as the currency for a specific ID or sub-ID and linked to the Ethereum NFT, that NFT will be able to be sent over from the Ethereum blockchain as a satoshi of that currency, sent to any address or ID on the Verus blockchain, exchanged trustlessly on the Verus on-chain P2P marketplace, and used to revoke and recover the ID which defined the token. Once the contracts are updated, you will be able to mint NFTs on Ethereum’s Goerli testnet, and  endow your Ethereum NFTs with all of the power of your specially named VerusID. This new technology allows you to protect your NFTs with VerusID’s revoke and recover technology, bind your NFT to the pseudonymous ID you use to log into applications, use it to extend and publish much more than just the NFT, and generally take your Ethereum NFTs to the next level!

The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. Drop by the #pbaas-development channel to help us prepare for mainnet and start building your vision today!

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```json
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json

    }
  ],

```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

Announcing v0.9.4-2, UNCHANGED FOR MAINNET -- MANDATORY FOR TESTNET USE

This release has no material mainnet changes.

THE NEW ETHEREUM BRIDGE IS EXPECTED TO BE DEFINED WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS AND FOR THE BRIDGE LIQUIDITY BASKET TO LAUNCH SHORTLY AFTER DEFINITION. IF YOU LEAVE A PRIOR VERSION NODE RUNNING UNTIL AFTER THE VETH BRIDGE IS DEFINED, YOU MAY FORK AWAY DUE TO CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE AND THEN NEED TO RESYNC TO TESTNET FROM SCRATCH TO CONTINUE.

For testnet, this is RC4 of the Verus PBaaS protocol, which includes some Ethereum bridge related fixes and a merge mining API change. With the API change, all merge mining nodes must upgrade to the new protocol to be compatible with each other and participate in cross-chain notarization rewards.

After the Ethereum bridge has been defined, you will be able to send currencies over to Verus testnet from Ethereum’s Goerli network and also participate in the launch of the Ethereum bridge liquidity basket with VETH, USDC, or VRSCTEST by using `sendcurrency` with `“preconvert”:true` on the command line or through the GUI. We recommend that you get some Goerli ETH using this facet or others (https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/), which will make your experience of all Verus PBaaS can offer a bit more well rounded when the Ethereum bridge is available once again.

Once the Goerli Ethereum liquidity basket (Bridge.vETH) activates on testnet, which is a 100% backed basket composed of 1/3rd each of Verus, Ethereum, and USDC (all testnet tokens), you can use it from Metamask on Goerli, from the Verus CLI or GUI on the vrsctest chain, or from CLI/GUI on other PBaaS chains to provide liquidity while holding Bridge.vETH, a 100% backed basket of three currencies of balanced relative value, or to pass through and convert currencies between Verus, Ethereum, USDC, and Bridge.vETH.

The Brige.vETH currency also coordinates with the vETH@ gateway and enables registering `*.veth@` IDs for $5 worth of Bridge.vETH, based on its internal USDC conversion price at the time of registration. When you register `*.veth@` IDs, 0.02 VRSCTEST goes to miners and stakers, and $5 worth of Bridge.vETH is burned, reducing the total supply of Bridge.vETH for everyone without reducing reserves, and contributing to the relative value, “real yield” of Bridge.vETH, relative to its three reserve currencies. This is the way that all decentralized, fractional currencies which enable ID registration accept registration fees, equally benefiting all fractional currency holders/liquidity providers when IDs are registered, while providing Verus miners and stakers the identity import fee of 0.02 VRSC.

`*.veth@` IDs have the ability, along with root vrsctest IDs, to make 1:1 ERC20 mapped currencies on Ethereum. They can also be used to create Tokenized ID control tokens (see notes for v0.9.4-1), as all types of IDs can, but if they are used to do that, they will have used their currency creation ability for that rather than an ERC20 mapped currency.

The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. Drop by #pbaas-development to start building your vision on Verus and help prepare PBaaS for mainnet!

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```json
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

Announcing v0.9.4-1 with the world’s first self-sovereign, tokenized ID control technology, RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET -- MANDATORY FOR TESTNET USE

This release has no material mainnet changes.

For testnet, this is RC3 of the PBaaS protocol and is required to follow the main testnet chain. RC3 has some significant and important API additions, including the ability for any ID at all, even sub-IDs, to generate a single token as its currency. That token then enables whoever holds it to have another level of revoke/recover power over the ID, in addition to the normal revocation and recovery authorities, which also still work. This technology is now available in the pre-existing APIs, updateidentity (for changing revocation / recovery authorities), revokeidentity, and recoveryidentity. Please see help for details.

In addition, we have continued to harden the protocol and fixed issues with cross-chain currency definition import/export and the new ability to burn reserves into a liquidity basket that were reported in the current testnet.

The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. Drop by pbaas-development to start building your vision on Verus while helping get PBaaS ready for mainnet!

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```json
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json

  ],
  "conversions": [

      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [

    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {

    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# Announcing v0.9.4, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET -- MANDATORY FOR TESTNET USE

This release fixes a mainnet issue that may, in rare cases, cause a node to deadlock.
It also adds the following new features to mainnet:
- Auto TLS encrypted connections between nodes on mainnet and testnet, no action needed, but you can require that all connections be encrypted by starting the daemon with “-tlsenforcement”.
- A new “-idindex” flag that enables 3 new APIs to lookup identities by their primary addresses or revocation and recovery addresses, `getidentitywithaddress`, `getidentitywithrevocation`, and `getidentitywithrecovery`.
  Generally improved multithreading within the daemon.
- These improvements allow anyone to now write applications to easily graph or display public relationships between identities, transparent addresses, and transactions without compromising the privacy of private addresses, messages, or transactions between identities using name@:private endpoints, z-addresses or communicating via off-chain channels.

For testnet, this is RC2 of the PBaaS protocol and has some significant and important advances and changes. In addition to a great deal of progress hardening for mainnet, v0.9.4 introduces the following new features to the PBaaS testnet:
- All features above for mainnet
- NFT mapped tokens and tokenized ID control - In v0.9.4, as with v0.9.3, you can use root identities to create any kind of currencies, *.veth IDs to create Ethereum mapped currencies, and what is new in v0.9.4 is that you can now use any type of ID or sub-ID to create a new kind of currency that will always have a 1 Satoshi supply and enable anyone holding it to have power over the ID that issued it. This type of currency is called tokenized ID control and can be treated like a super NFT over all copies of the source ID on all chains that were exported to other chains after the currency was created. Once the Ethereum contracts are upgraded with this capability, *.veth or IDs with root names on the Verus blockchain can be used to create Ethereum NFT mapped currencies, which enable a Cryptopunk, Ethrock, or whatever other NFT you’d like to not only be sent to Verus, held on a revocable/recoverable ID, and also permanently upleveled with ID powers, being cryptographically bound as an ID’s permanent control token that can be sent to any chain or to Ethereum and back.
  This unique Verus-only technology and VerusIDs enable new models of complex, atomic and fully decentralized transactions. By using exported IDs across any number of networks and an ID control token, ownership of an unlimited array of assets across an unlimited number of networks can for the first time ever, have ownership transferred in one transaction.
- While NFT mapped tokens are supported on the RC2 PBaaS protocol, they have not yet been implemented in the Ethereum contracts. You will not be able to send NFTs from Ethereum to Verus or PBaaS chains until that work is complete, which we do not expect to take a great deal of time.
- Liquidity currencies now support new methods to burn currency with the following results:
  - `burnweight` - available to centralized currencies only and enables burning the primary currency to raise the reserve ratio weights of all reserves.
  - `burn` for reserve currencies - in prior releases, burn was only used for primary currencies and would reduce the supply of a currency relative to its reserves, increasing the on-chain value of the primary currency. In v0.9.4, you can now also “burn” reserve currencies in a liquidity basket currency, which simply donates that amount of reserve into the currency’s reserves without taking any new supply in exchange. This is available to decentralized or centralized currencies.

- Bridgekeeper is now available for permissionless bridge notarization and selectable in the GUI on the mining page. For CLI, we will make a Node application available for testing in the next few days.
- RC1 cross-chain witness and notarization protocol enhanced in RC2 as follows:
  - In RC2, any notarization to be confirmed must be first posted publicly to allow for potential to prove invalidity, and then later confirmed. In the prior protocol, a witnessed notarization could be posted to a chain and accepted when first seen. Upon analysis and discussion with @allbits and others, we realized that the attack vector of even stolen notary/witness keys combined with an in-secret 51% combined hash/stake attack could be prevented if we changed the protocol to first require posting the ready to finalize data and allow notaries who recognize that there is a signature on chain for something they don’t agree with (likely stolen key), to simply revoke their identity, which will prevent that notarization from ever being confirmed. This same security feature is supported between all PBaaS chains and has been implemented in the Ethereum contracts for witnesses as well. This new protocol also provides for other types of evidence to prevent finalization, such as proof that there exists a more powerful (most power rule) tip than one witnessed. Enabling decentralized, cross-chain most power rules are an advance in cross-chain protocols that over time will strongly protect censorship resistance qualities of any multichain protocol.
  - The above technology required changes to generalize evidence types between chains, enabling cryptographic enforcement that all notarizations are ultimately determined by miners and stakers and finalized by witnesses who must follow most power (stake+work) rules based on the protocol. Witnesses cannot finalize a chain tip unless alternating miners and stakers have posted 3 consecutive, agreeing, progressing cross-chain notarizations, without intervening disagreement, trading off more certain cross-chain transaction latency for on that depends on miners and stakers, meaning maximum decentralization and a high cost to DoS attack cross-chain, approaching impossible over any significant length of time. This approach makes the incentivized merge mining and bridge mining opportunities, as well as miner/staker participation, automatically part of and also critical to the cross-chain protocol. In v0.9.4, all users on the network may mine the Ethereum bridge via the bridgekeeper tool on the mining page in the GUI.
  - With this new protocol, all PBaaS chains on testnet will consider witnessed / finalized tips final and will not unwind past those witness points or follow a chain that disagrees with a known finalized tip. When this protocol goes live on mainnet, and for any PBaaS chain whose community opts to use the Komodo notary service, Komodo notarizations will continue to ensure a stable chain tip, but no matter what other notarizations are present, PBaaS chains will always follow their proof of power protocol and lock to their witnessed tips as well.

### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):
The currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.
```
verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"ID","options":2080,"preallocations":[{"ControlTokenRecipient@":0.00000001}],"maxpreconversion":[0]}'
```

The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. Drop by pbaas-development to start building your vision on Verus while helping get PBaaS ready for mainnet!

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**

verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```json
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1                  // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2                 // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4                  // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8                // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16        // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                      // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64             // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128                   // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256                     // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512         // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024   // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain
OPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048                // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

```



### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# Announcing v0.9.3, NON-MANDATORY FOR MAINNET -- MANDATORY FOR TESTNET USE

This release fixes one issue on mainnet where a node using -connect=”networkaddress” may still attempt to connect to other nodes.

This update includes the first protocol release candidate for mainnet PBaaS, VerusID protocol upgrades, and Verus DeFi. In addition to some functional fixes and full web site support for mapped currencies and simple commands for mapping Verus currencies to any ERC20 currencies on Ethereum with provable, auditable 1:1 mapping and cross chain send/receive. In addition this new protocol upgrade changes some parameters of the Verus Proof of Power consensus algorithm, enabling smoother starts, restarts, and general operation of PBaaS chains, regardless of their native currency supply or emission schedule. As these consensus parameter changes would require either a testnet fork, which would not be relevant for the mainnet upgrade or a reset, accessing the v0.9.3 testnet requires that you reset your local testnet by deleting the vrsctest and pbaas data folders from the locations described below.

As part of this release, we will be launching the new Ethereum bridge and enable full use of Ethereum mapped currencies on the Goerli Ethereum testnet (note that we were previously using Rinkeby). This makes it easy for any currency definition to become a fully decentralized, auditable stable coin, simply by mapping to DAI, USDT, USDC, or another stable coin on Ethereum. In addition, the new website for Metamask support and use from Ethereum now displays all mapped currency options, even those added when someone exports a currency definition to Ethereum, either as a mapped currency or for using any Verus or PBaaS currency as an ERC20.

This release also resolves an issue with setting max preconversion amounts on currency launches and addresses a number of minor protocol issues found as a result of the active community testing support we are seeing on testnet.

v0.9.3 RESETS TESTNET AND ADDRESSES ALL KNOWN ISSUES FOUND DURING TESTING ON THE NETWORK. FROM HERE, WE HOPE ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS WILL JOIN IN TRYING OUT ALL FEATURES OF TESTNET TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE FINAL MAINNET RELEASE, WHICH WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS AS SOON AS IT IS CONSIDERED READY AND HARDENED, WILL BE BOTH SMOOTH AND WORLD-CHANGING.

IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED TESTNET WITH VERSIONS PRIOR TO v0.9.2, MAKE SURE TO DELETE AND CLEAR ANY EXISTING TESTNET DATA FOLDERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

## Platform Support
- Debian 9 (Stretch) is no longer supported
## PROTOCOL RELEASE CANDIDATE RC1
With v0.9.3, The Verus PBaaS protocol, including networking, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi, is considered release candidate RC1 for the coming mainnet upgrade. The core developer focus now remains on protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets as well as merge mining for pool servers.

## NEW PBAAS CAPABILITIES
All PBaaS capabilities, including for application development, are available now on the new Verus testnet. Now would be a good time for development capable projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus’s transformative technologies to do a deep dive on the Verus testnet. These new capabilities in v0.9.3, as well as all those we are familiar with, available nowhere else, will be on mainnet SOON(™):

All fractional and centralized {“proofprotocol”:2} currencies can now issue as a decentralized operation, or with centralized currencies, sell, IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, permission from the currency identity required, which means the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity, or even referrals required, which means that an identity registration must have a referral and co-signature of a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.
For fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone.
The minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself, or in one of its reserves, for example USDC or DAI.

More than the minimum price can be paid for ID registration, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.
Each currency, either centralized and/or fractional, can have multiple levels of referral support (limit of 5 levels), meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies, or be sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.

While Native IDs, those registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, will be able to launch currencies on that blockchain, and if on Verus, actual independent blockchains, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, but will still be valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features, for proofs, for brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login, and will have the ability to cross-prove common ownership with other IDs as well.

The exception to non-native IDs creating currencies, is that *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter and will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. Registration of .veth IDs will be priced at 100 USD worth of ETH to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.

All of these features are currently enabled on the v0.9.3 new testnet. Stay connected on the #pbaas-development channel and participate in the launch at no actual cost as a testnet liquidity provider and get some nice testnet IDs, launch your own currencies, or start your exclusive ID-restricted club, governance group, or business.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```json
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1              // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2             // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4              // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8            // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16  // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64       // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128              // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256               // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_PBAAS_CONVERTER = 512     // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

```



### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# Announcing v0.9.2-3, NON-MANDATORY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET -- CRITICAL FOR TESTNET USE

This update enables full use of Ethereum mapped currencies (Rinkeby when the new bridge launches), which provides the ability for any currency to become a fully decentralized, auditable stable coin, simply by mapping to DAI, USDT, USDC, or another on Ethereum. In addition, the new website for Metamask support and use from Ethereum now displays all mapped currency options, even those added when someone exports a currency definition to Ethereum, either as a mapped currency or for using any Verus or PBaaS currency as an ERC20.

This release also resolves two PBaaS chain launch issues, one that prevented no-reward chains with initial emission from being accepted and one that could allow a chain launch to go forward, even when a co-launched liquidity basket failed to get enough participation. Thanks to increased participation on testnet use, we are getting continued excellent coverage and resolving issues, which are increasingly edge conditions as we go. discovered on both mainnet and testnet and on testnet fixes an error creating transactions for sub identity registrations on fractional reserve currencies. If you already went through the testnet reset process on any version since v0.9.2, you do not need to reset testnet. The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior version.

v0.9.2 RESETS TESTNET AND ADDS A COMPLETE SET OF NEW CAPABILITIES PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED STRETCH GOALS THAT ENABLE BRANDED SUB-ID ISSUANCE WITH BOTH DECENTRALIZED AND CENTRALIZED OPTIONS AS WELL AS THE FIRST DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TO SOLVE FOR BRANDED LOYALTY IDENTITIES WITH NOVEL SOLUTIONS FOR ROYALTY AND IP LICENSING BUSINESS MODELS.

IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED TESTNET WITH VERSIONS PRIOR TO v0.9.2, MAKE SURE TO DELETE AND CLEAR ANY EXISTING TESTNET DATA FOLDERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

FOR MAINNET (AND TESTNET), v0.9.2 PROVIDES ENHANCED PRIVACY FEATURES FOR IDENTITY CREATION

## PROTOCOL FEATURE COMPLETE
With v0.9.2, The Verus network, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols are considered feature complete for the coming mainnet PBaaS upgrade. The core developer focus now is protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets as well as merge mining for pool servers.

## NEW 3D CROSS-CHAIN LIQUIDITY NETWORK VISUALIZER (GUI FOR TESTNET)
In v0.9.2 Verus Desktop, there is a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on chain and cross-chain, with the ability to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions. To access the visualizer, click on “Visualize Network” on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop. If you’re interested in seeing the visualizer now, here’s a link directly to the visualizer as part of a recent video members of the community helped make (https://youtu.be/CkgUVjx_g1M?t=43).

## NEW PBAAS CAPABILITIES
All PBaaS capabilities, including for application development, are available now on the new Verus testnet. Our goal for interoperability on this new testnet is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge in the next couple days. Now would be a good time for development capable projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus’s transformative technologies to do a deep dive on the Verus testnet. These new capabilities in v0.9.2, as well as all those we are familiar with, available nowhere else, will be on mainnet SOON(™):

All fractional and centralized {“proofprotocol”:2} currencies can now issue as a decentralized operation, or with centralized currencies, sell, IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, permission from the currency identity required, which means the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity, or even referrals required, which means that an identity registration must have a referral and co-signature of a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.
For fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone.
The minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself, or in one of its reserves, for example USDC or DAI.
More than the minimum price can be paid for ID registration, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.
Each currency, either centralized and/or fractional, can have multiple levels of referral support (limit of 5 levels), meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies, or be sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.

While Native IDs, those registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, will be able to launch currencies on that blockchain, and if on Verus, actual independent blockchains, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, but will still be valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features, for proofs, for brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login, and will have the ability to cross-prove common ownership with other IDs as well.

The exception to non-native IDs creating currencies, is that *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter and will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. Registration of .veth IDs will be priced at a level to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.

All of these features are currently enabled on the v0.9.2 new testnet. Stay connected on the #pbaas-development channel and participate in the launch at no actual cost as a testnet liquidity provider and get some nice testnet IDs, launch your own currencies, or start your exclusive ID-restricted club, governance group, or business.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**

verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1              // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2             // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4              // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8            // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16  // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64       // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128              // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256               // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_PBAAS_CONVERTER = 512     // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
  "name": "PBaaSChain",
  "options": 264,
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST"
  ],
  "conversions": [

  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "reward": 1200000000,
      "decay": 0,
      "halving": 0,
      "eraend": 0
    }
  ],
  "notaries": [
    "Notary1@",
    "Notary2@",
    "Notary3@",
  ],
  "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
    },
    {
      "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
      "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
    }
  ],
  "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
  "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
  "currencies": [
    "VRSCTEST",
    "PBaaSChain",
    "USD"
  ],
  "initialcontributions": [

    0,
    1000000
  ],
  "initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```shell
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# Announcing v0.9.2-2, NON-MANDATORY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET -- CRITICAL FOR TESTNET USE

This update improves sync speed in some edge cases on both mainnet and testnet and on testnet fixes an error creating transactions for sub identity registrations on fractional reserve currencies. If you already went through the testnet reset process on any version since v0.9.2, you do not need to reset testnet. The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior version.

v0.9.2 RESETS TESTNET AND ADDS A COMPLETE SET OF NEW CAPABILITIES PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED STRETCH GOALS THAT ENABLE BRANDED SUB-ID ISSUANCE WITH BOTH DECENTRALIZED AND CENTRALIZED OPTIONS AS WELL AS THE FIRST DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TO SOLVE FOR BRANDED LOYALTY IDENTITIES WITH NOVEL SOLUTIONS FOR ROYALTY AND IP LICENSING BUSINESS MODELS.

IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED TESTNET WITH VERSIONS PRIOR TO v0.9.2, MAKE SURE TO DELETE AND CLEAR ANY EXISTING TESTNET DATA FOLDERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

FOR MAINNET (AND TESTNET), v0.9.2 PROVIDES ENHANCED PRIVACY FEATURES FOR IDENTITY CREATION

## PROTOCOL FEATURE COMPLETE
With v0.9.2, The Verus network, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols are considered feature complete for the coming mainnet PBaaS upgrade. The core developer focus now is protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets as well as merge mining for pool servers.

## NEW 3D CROSS-CHAIN LIQUIDITY NETWORK VISUALIZER (GUI FOR TESTNET)
In v0.9.2 Verus Desktop, there is a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on chain and cross-chain, with the ability to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions. To access the visualizer, click on “Visualize Network” on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop. If you’re interested in seeing the visualizer now, here’s a link directly to the visualizer as part of a recent video members of the community helped make (https://youtu.be/CkgUVjx_g1M?t=43).

## NEW PBAAS CAPABILITIES
All PBaaS capabilities, including for application development, are available now on the new Verus testnet. Our goal for interoperability on this new testnet is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge in the next couple days. Now would be a good time for development capable projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus’s transformative technologies to do a deep dive on the Verus testnet. These new capabilities in v0.9.2, as well as all those we are familiar with, available nowhere else, will be on mainnet SOON(™):

All fractional and centralized {“proofprotocol”:2} currencies can now issue as a decentralized operation, or with centralized currencies, sell, IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, permission from the currency identity required, which means the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity, or even referrals required, which means that an identity registration must have a referral and co-signature of a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.
For fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone.
The minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself, or in one of its reserves, for example USDC or DAI.
More than the minimum price can be paid for ID registration, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.
Each currency, either centralized and/or fractional, can have multiple levels of referral support (limit of 5 levels), meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies, or be sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.

While Native IDs, those registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, will be able to launch currencies on that blockchain, and if on Verus, actual independent blockchains, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, but will still be valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features, for proofs, for brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login, and will have the ability to cross-prove common ownership with other IDs as well.

The exception to non-native IDs creating currencies, is that *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter and will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. Registration of .veth IDs will be priced at a level to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.

All of these features are currently enabled on the v0.9.2 new testnet. Stay connected on the #pbaas-development channel and participate in the launch at no actual cost as a testnet liquidity provider and get some nice testnet IDs, launch your own currencies, or start your exclusive ID-restricted club, governance group, or business.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

  - Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```

## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1              // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2             // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4              // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8            // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16  // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64       // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128              // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256               // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_PBAAS_CONVERTER = 512     // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
    "name": "PBaaSChain",
    "options": 264,
    "currencies": [
      "VRSCTEST"
    ],
    "conversions": [
      1
    ],
    "eras": [
      {
        "reward": 1200000000,
        "decay": 0,
        "halving": 0,
        "eraend": 0
      }
    ],
    "notaries": [
      "Notary1@",
      "Notary2@",
      "Notary3@",
    ],
    "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
    "nodes": [
      {
        "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
        "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
      },
      {
        "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
        "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
      }
    ],
    "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
    "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
  }
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
    "currencies": [
      "VRSCTEST",
      "PBaaSChain",
      "USD"
    ],
    "initialcontributions": [
      380228.12033701,
      0,
      1000000
    ],
    "initialsupply": 3000000
  }
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# Announcing v0.9.2-1, NO FUNCTIONAL CHANGES TO MAINNET FROM v0.9.2 -- CRITICAL FOR TESTNET USE

This update fixes an error in creating transactions for sub identity registrations on fractional reserve currencies and it fixes a synchronization issue that could prevent some clients from fully syncing testnet. The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior version.

v0.9.2 RESETS TESTNET AND ADDS A COMPLETE SET OF NEW CAPABILITIES PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED STRETCH GOALS THAT ENABLE BRANDED SUB-ID ISSUANCE WITH BOTH DECENTRALIZED AND CENTRALIZED OPTIONS AS WELL AS THE FIRST DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TO SOLVE FOR BRANDED LOYALTY IDENTITIES WITH NOVEL SOLUTIONS FOR ROYALTY AND IP LICENSING BUSINESS MODELS.

IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED TESTNET WITH VERSIONS PRIOR TO v0.9.2, MAKE SURE TO DELETE AND CLEAR ANY EXISTING TESTNET DATA FOLDERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

FOR MAINNET (AND TESTNET), v0.9.2 PROVIDES ENHANCED PRIVACY FEATURES FOR IDENTITY CREATION

## PROTOCOL FEATURE COMPLETE
With v0.9.2, The Verus network, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols are considered feature complete for the coming mainnet PBaaS upgrade. The core developer focus now is protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets as well as merge mining for pool servers.

## NEW 3D CROSS-CHAIN LIQUIDITY NETWORK VISUALIZER (GUI FOR TESTNET)
In v0.9.2 Verus Desktop, there is a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on chain and cross-chain, with the ability to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions. To access the visualizer, click on “Visualize Network” on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop. If you’re interested in seeing the visualizer now, here’s a link directly to the visualizer as part of a recent video members of the community helped make (https://youtu.be/CkgUVjx_g1M?t=43).

## NEW PBAAS CAPABILITIES
All PBaaS capabilities, including for application development, are available now on the new Verus testnet. Our goal for interoperability on this new testnet is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge in the next couple days. Now would be a good time for development capable projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus’s transformative technologies to do a deep dive on the Verus testnet. These new capabilities in v0.9.2, as well as all those we are familiar with, available nowhere else, will be on mainnet SOON(™):

All fractional and centralized {“proofprotocol”:2} currencies can now issue as a decentralized operation, or with centralized currencies, sell, IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, permission from the currency identity required, which means the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity, or even referrals required, which means that an identity registration must have a referral and co-signature of a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.
For fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone.
The minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself, or in one of its reserves, for example USDC or DAI.
More than the minimum price can be paid for ID registration, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.
Each currency, either centralized and/or fractional, can have multiple levels of referral support (limit of 5 levels), meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies, or be sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.

While Native IDs, those registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, will be able to launch currencies on that blockchain, and if on Verus, actual independent blockchains, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, but will still be valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features, for proofs, for brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login, and will have the ability to cross-prove common ownership with other IDs as well.

The exception to non-native IDs creating currencies, is that *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter and will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. Registration of .veth IDs will be priced at a level to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.

All of these features are currently enabled on the v0.9.2 new testnet. Stay connected on the #pbaas-development channel and participate in the launch at no actual cost as a testnet liquidity provider and get some nice testnet IDs, launch your own currencies, or start your exclusive ID-restricted club, governance group, or business.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

  - Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```json
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
## Defining a Currency
### Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1              // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2             // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4              // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8            // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16  // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64       // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128              // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256               // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_PBAAS_CONVERTER = 512     // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
    "name": "PBaaSChain",
    "options": 264,
    "currencies": [
      "VRSCTEST"
    ],
    "conversions": [
      1
    ],
    "eras": [
      {
        "reward": 1200000000,
        "decay": 0,
        "halving": 0,
        "eraend": 0
      }
    ],
    "notaries": [
      "Notary1@",
      "Notary2@",
      "Notary3@",
    ],
    "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
    "nodes": [
      {
        "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
        "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
      },
      {
        "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
        "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
      }
    ],
    "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
    "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
  }
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
    "currencies": [
      "VRSCTEST",
      "PBaaSChain",
      "USD"
    ],
    "initialcontributions": [
      380228.12033701,
      0,
      1000000
    ],
    "initialsupply": 3000000
  }
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## Announcing v0.9.2, OPTIONAL, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET, MANDATORY FOR TESTNET USE - THIS IS A BIG ANNOUNCE, BUT IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE PBAAS UPGRADE, WE RECOMMEND READING IT ALL.

v0.9.2 RESETS TESTNET AND ADDS A COMPLETE SET OF NEW CAPABILITIES PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED STRETCH GOALS THAT ENABLE BRANDED SUB-ID ISSUANCE WITH BOTH DECENTRALIZED AND CENTRALIZED OPTIONS AS WELL AS THE FIRST DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TO SOLVE FOR BRANDED LOYALTY IDENTITIES WITH NOVEL SOLUTIONS FOR ROYALTY AND IP LICENSING BUSINESS MODELS.

IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED TESTNET WITH VERSIONS PRIOR TO v0.9.2, MAKE SURE TO DELETE AND CLEAR ANY EXISTING TESTNET DATA FOLDERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

FOR MAINNET (AND TESTNET), v0.9.2 PROVIDES ENHANCED PRIVACY FEATURES FOR IDENTITY CREATION

## PROTOCOL FEATURE COMPLETE
With v0.9.2, The Verus network, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols are considered feature complete for the coming mainnet PBaaS upgrade. The core developer focus now is protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets as well as merge mining for pool servers.

## NEW 3D CROSS-CHAIN LIQUIDITY NETWORK VISUALIZER (GUI FOR TESTNET)
In v0.9.2 Verus Desktop, there is a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on chain and cross-chain, with the ability to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions. To access the visualizer, click on “Visualize Network” on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop. If you’re interested in seeing the visualizer now, here’s a link directly to the visualizer as part of a recent video members of the community helped make (https://youtu.be/CkgUVjx_g1M?t=43).

## NEW PBAAS CAPABILITIES
All PBaaS capabilities, including for application development, are available now on the new Verus testnet. Our goal for interoperability on this new testnet is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge in the next couple days. Now would be a good time for development capable projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus’s transformative technologies to do a deep dive on the Verus testnet. These new capabilities in v0.9.2, as well as all those we are familiar with, available nowhere else, will be on mainnet SOON(™):

All fractional and centralized {“proofprotocol”:2} currencies can now issue as a decentralized operation, or with centralized currencies, sell, IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, permission from the currency identity required, which means the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity, or even referrals required, which means that an identity registration must have a referral and co-signature of a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.
For fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone.
The minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself, or in one of its reserves, for example USDC or DAI.
More than the minimum price can be paid for ID registration, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.
Each currency, either centralized and/or fractional, can have multiple levels of referral support (limit of 5 levels), meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies, or be sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.

While Native IDs, those registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, will be able to launch currencies on that blockchain, and if on Verus, actual independent blockchains, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, but will still be valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features, for proofs, for brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login, and will have the ability to cross-prove common ownership with other IDs as well.

The exception to non-native IDs creating currencies, is that *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter and will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. Registration of .veth IDs will be priced at a level to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.

All of these features are currently enabled on the v0.9.2 new testnet. Stay connected on the #pbaas-development channel and participate in the launch at no actual cost as a testnet liquidity provider and get some nice testnet IDs, launch your own currencies, or start your exclusive ID-restricted club, governance group, or business.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

  - Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent
`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `""` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration

```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds
verus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr "" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
````
Specify the parent in the identity definition. Enter `false` for `returntx` to sign and submit the id registration, `0` for the `feeoffer` to use the default fee, and the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address
```json
# verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds

verus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{"txid": "67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f","namereservation": { "version": 1,  "name": "ID",  "parent": "i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt", "salt": "b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01", "referral": ""},"identity":{"primaryaddresses":["RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr"],"minimumsignatures":1,"name":"ID","parent":"vrsc-btc@"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny
```
If a currency's ID issuance require permission from the currency's identity then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```json
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
## Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1              // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2             // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4              // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8            // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16  // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64       // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128              // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256               // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_PBAAS_CONVERTER = 512     // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
    "name": "PBaaSChain",
    "options": 264,
    "currencies": [
      "VRSCTEST"
    ],
    "conversions": [
      1
    ],
    "eras": [
      {
        "reward": 1200000000,
        "decay": 0,
        "halving": 0,
        "eraend": 0
      }
    ],
    "notaries": [
      "Notary1@",
      "Notary2@",
      "Notary3@",
    ],
    "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
    "nodes": [
      {
        "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
        "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
      },
      {
        "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
        "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
      }
    ],
    "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
    "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
  }
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
    "currencies": [
      "VRSCTEST",
      "PBaaSChain",
      "USD"
    ],
    "initialcontributions": [
      380228.12033701,
      0,
      1000000
    ],
    "initialsupply": 3000000
  }
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# ANNOUNCING PBAAS TESTNET UPGRADE v0.9.1-2, OPTIONAL FOR MAINNET USERS -- MANDATORY FOR TESTNET USERS
### v0.9.1-2 RESETS TESTNET -- THERE ARE NO MAINNET CHANGES

### IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED TESTNET WITH VERSIONS PRIOR TO v0.9.1-2, MAKE SURE TO DELETE AND CLEAR ANY EXISTING TESTNET DATA FOLDERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.
## Testnet Featuring Verus PBaaS
### The most powerful and interoperable currency, blockchain, and ERC20 launch, scale, and MEV-resistant DeFi platform to exist, all with no programming required!

## Verus PBaaS Features Live on v0.9.1-2 Testnet
- Provable or pseudonymous, identity-based currency, liquidity pool, NFT and multi-blockchain, fully decentralized network.
- On-chain 100% decentralized, launches with fair launch and/or crowdfunding options, on-chain auto-refund option for missed targets, automatic Ethereum ERC20 contract deployment, auto-created, MEV-resistant, liquidity baskets and even auto-bridged, merge mineable, fully independent rent-free PBaaS blockchain launches.
- All DeFi AMM conversions are verified via mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol. All conversions in a single liquidity basket are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block, meaning all participants get the same price in all directions of conversion, with a minimum conversion fee of 0.025% and a maximum of 0.05%.
- All currencies and identities are primitives at L1 and are validated and verified on UTXO transactions, which check all inputs and outputs just as single currency L1, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin check the native currency inputs and outputs of transactions.
- All currencies on all independent connected chains, once launched can be sent back and forth to other multi-currency capable networks (currently other independent PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s).
- Currencies on Verus can also be defined as "mapped currencies", which map 1:1 to an existing currency on Ethereum (eg. DAI), and can then be sent from Ethereum with simple transactions and received and used as the new "mapped currency", or sent back to Ethereum and used there as the original currency.
- Currency launches can raise funds in 3 ways. Each of these fundraising options creates a currency that is not 100% backed, and has a price that responds to market forces. 100% backed currencies do not change their relative price to the underlying basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, whether time-locked or not, take their funding from a percentage of the reserve backing. Except in the case of a new blockchain launch, which creates new native currency for operating the proof of stake of the blockchain, any currency that uses fundraising options will be a fractionally backed currency which will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it. If a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options that are not met, no fundraising is received:
  - Pre-launch discount - all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency. This is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live.
- Pre-launch carve-out - this enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.
- Pre-allocation - this enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

  - Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```json
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
## Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1              // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2             // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4              // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8            // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16  // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64       // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128              // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256               // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_PBAAS_CONVERTER = 512     // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
    "name": "PBaaSChain",
    "options": 264,
    "currencies": [
      "VRSCTEST"
    ],
    "conversions": [
      1
    ],
    "eras": [
      {
        "reward": 1200000000,
        "decay": 0,
        "halving": 0,
        "eraend": 0
      }
    ],
    "notaries": [
      "Notary1@",
      "Notary2@",
      "Notary3@",
    ],
    "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
    "nodes": [
      {
        "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
        "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
      },
      {
        "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
        "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
      }
    ],
    "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
    "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
  }
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
    "currencies": [
      "VRSCTEST",
      "PBaaSChain",
      "USD"
    ],
    "initialcontributions": [
      380228.12033701,
      0,
      1000000
    ],
    "initialsupply": 3000000
  }
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# ANNOUNCING MAINNET AND PBAAS TESTNET UPGRADE v0.9.1-1
## CRITICAL FOR NOTARIES, POOLS, EXCHANGES, MANDATORY FOR TESTNET USERS, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MAINNET USERS
### v0.9.1-1 includes testnet fixes for the Ethereum bridge launch with advanced features, addresses all known issues on testnet, and includes sync improvements for testnet and mainnet.

## Testnet Featuring Verus PBaaS
### The most powerful and interoperable currency, blockchain, and ERC20 launch, scale, and MEV-resistant DeFi platform to exist, all with no programming required!

### IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED TESTNET WITH VERSIONS PRIOR TO v0.9.1, MAKE SURE TO DELETE AND CLEAR ANY EXISTING TESTNET DATA FOLDERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

## Verus PBaaS Features Live on v0.9.1-1 Testnet
- Provable or pseudonymous, identity-based currency, liquidity pool, NFT and multi-blockchain, fully decentralized network.
- On-chain 100% decentralized, launches with fair launch and/or crowdfunding options, on-chain auto-refund option for missed targets, automatic Ethereum ERC20 contract deployment, auto-created, MEV-resistant, liquidity baskets and even auto-bridged, merge mineable, fully independent rent-free PBaaS blockchain launches.
- All DeFi AMM conversions are verified via mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol. All conversions in a single liquidity basket are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block, meaning all participants get the same price in all directions of conversion, with a minimum conversion fee of 0.025% and a maximum of 0.05%.
- All currencies and identities are primitives at L1 and are validated and verified on UTXO transactions, which check all inputs and outputs just as single currency L1, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin check the native currency inputs and outputs of transactions.
- All currencies on all independent connected chains, once launched can be sent back and forth to other multi-currency capable networks (currently other independent PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s).
- Currencies on Verus can also be defined as "mapped currencies", which map 1:1 to an existing currency on Ethereum (eg. DAI), and can then be sent from Ethereum with simple transactions and received and used as the new "mapped currency", or sent back to Ethereum and used there as the original currency.
- Currency launches can raise funds in 3 ways. Each of these fundraising options creates a currency that is not 100% backed, and has a price that responds to market forces. 100% backed currencies do not change their relative price to the underlying basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, whether time-locked or not, take their funding from a percentage of the reserve backing. Except in the case of a new blockchain launch, which creates new native currency for operating the proof of stake of the blockchain, any currency that uses fundraising options will be a fractionally backed currency which will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it. If a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options that are not met, no fundraising is received:
  - Pre-launch discount - all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency. This is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live.
- Pre-launch carve-out - this enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.
- Pre-allocation - this enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

  - Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
```json
verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
```
### Defining a Currency
## Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1              // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2             // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4              // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8            // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16  // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64       // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128              // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256               // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_PBAAS_CONVERTER = 512     // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
    "name": "PBaaSChain",
    "options": 264,
    "currencies": [
      "VRSCTEST"
    ],
    "conversions": [
      1
    ],
    "eras": [
      {
        "reward": 1200000000,
        "decay": 0,
        "halving": 0,
        "eraend": 0
      }
    ],
    "notaries": [
      "Notary1@",
      "Notary2@",
      "Notary3@",
    ],
    "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
    "nodes": [
      {
        "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
        "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
      },
      {
        "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
        "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
      }
    ],
    "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
    "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
  }
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
    "currencies": [
      "VRSCTEST",
      "PBaaSChain",
      "USD"
    ],
    "initialcontributions": [
      380228.12033701,
      0,
      1000000
    ],
    "initialsupply": 3000000
  }
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# ANNOUNCING NON-MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET, MANDATORY FOR TESTNET PBAAS UPGRADE v0.9.1
## Testnet Featuring Verus PBaaS -- The most powerful and interoperable currency, blockchain, and ERC20 launch, scale, and MEV-resistant DeFi platform to exist, all with no programming required!

### v0.9.1 improves mainnet bootstrap and GUI backup/restore user experience but does not upgrade mainnet protocols and is not a required update for mainnet-only users. It is required to use the public testnet. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED TESTNET WITH PRIOR VERSIONS, MAKE SURE TO DELETE AND CLEAR ANY EXISTING TESTNET DATA FOLDERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

## Verus PBaaS Features Live on v0.9.1 Testnet
- Provable or pseudonymous, identity-based currency, liquidity pool, NFT and multi-blockchain, fully decentralized network.
- On-chain 100% decentralized, launches with fair launch and/or crowdfunding options, on-chain auto-refund option for missed targets, automatic Ethereum ERC20 contract deployment, auto-created, MEV-resistant, liquidity baskets and even auto-bridged, merge mineable, fully independent rent-free PBaaS blockchain launches.
- All DeFi AMM conversions are verified via mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol. All conversions in a single liquidity basket are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block, meaning all participants get the same price in all directions of conversion, with a minimum conversion fee of 0.025% and a maximum of 0.05%.
- All currencies and identities are primitives at L1 and are validated and verified on UTXO transactions, which check all inputs and outputs just as single currency L1, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin check the native currency inputs and outputs of transactions.
- All currencies on all independent connected chains, once launched can be sent back and forth to other multi-currency capable networks (currently other independent PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s).
- Currencies on Verus can also be defined as "mapped currencies", which map 1:1 to an existing currency on Ethereum (eg. DAI), and can then be sent from Ethereum with simple transactions and received and used as the new "mapped currency", or sent back to Ethereum and used there as the original currency.
- Currency launches can raise funds in 3 ways. Each of these fundraising options creates a currency that is not 100% backed, and has a price that responds to market forces. 100% backed currencies do not change their relative price to the underlying basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, whether time-locked or not, take their funding from a percentage of the reserve backing. Except in the case of a new blockchain launch, which creates new native currency for operating the proof of stake of the blockchain, any currency that uses fundraising options will be a fractionally backed currency which will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it. If a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options that are not met, no fundraising is received:
  - Pre-launch discount - all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency. This is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live.
- Pre-launch carve-out - this enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.
- Pre-allocation - this enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

  - Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

# Additional Verus Capabilities
- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs
- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming
- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles

### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

### Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
  ```
verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
  ```
verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
  ```
verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
```

### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
### Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- **Time Delay:**
The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
```
Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
```json
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
```json

### Defining a Currency
## Currency Options
```
OPTION_FRACTIONAL = 1              // allows reserve conversion using base calculations when set
OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE = 2             // clear is permissionless, if set, IDs may only be created by controlling ID
OPTION_ID_STAKING = 4              // all IDs on chain stake equally, rather than value-based staking
OPTION_ID_REFERRALS = 8            // if set, this chain supports referrals
OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED = 16  // if set, this chain requires referrals
OPTION_TOKEN = 32                // if set, this is a token, not a native currency
OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64       // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency
OPTION_GATEWAY = 128              // if set, this routes external currencies
OPTION_PBAAS = 256               // this is a PBaaS chain definition
OPTION_PBAAS_CONVERTER = 512     // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices
```

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":32,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

  ```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

### Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
  {
    "name": "PBaaSChain",
    "options": 264,
    "currencies": [
      "VRSCTEST"
    ],
    "conversions": [
      1
    ],
    "eras": [
      {
        "reward": 1200000000,
        "decay": 0,
        "halving": 0,
        "eraend": 0
      }
    ],
    "notaries": [
      "Notary1@",
      "Notary2@",
      "Notary3@",
    ],
    "minnotariesconfirm": 2,
    "nodes": [
      {
        "networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
        "nodeidentity": "Node1@"
      },
      {
        "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
        "nodeidentity": "Node2@"
      }
    ],
    "gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
    "gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
  }
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
  {
    "currencies": [
      "VRSCTEST",
      "PBaaSChain",
      "USD"
    ],
    "initialcontributions": [
      380228.12033701,
      0,
      1000000
    ],
    "initialsupply": 3000000
  }
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":264,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# Announcing NON-MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED Verus v0.9.0-3. This release is considered non-mandatory but IS RECOMMENDED for mainnet users, Komodo notaries, and is recommended for testnet users to ensure the best experience with testnet.

## This version fixes the following issues with v0.9.0-2
- Adds GUI support for seeing, making, and taking offers for currency or identity trades on the VerusID tab and when searching for identities.
- Fixes an issue where offers to buy or sell IDs were prematurely closed, even when expiry was set far in the future
- Fixes an issue with setidentitytimelock that caused it to return an error in most cases
- Ensures full rescanning of identities when using z_importwallet

## New Command and API for Verus Vault - setidentitytimelock
v0.9.0-2 introduced a new command and RPC API, "setidentitytimelock". setidentitytimelock may be used to set a time unlock delay, set a lock until a specific block height, or unlock a delayed timelock on a VerusID under your control.

You can use setidentitytimelock in one of two ways:
```
verus setidentitytimelock '{"unlockatblock":1796500}' (returntx)
```
or
```
verus setidentitytimelock '{"setunlockdelay":1440}' (returntx)
```
or
```
verus setidentitytimelock '{"unlockatblock":0}' (returntx)
```
The first example will lock the ID until the block specified. If the block specified is in the past, the ID will not be locked.
The second example will set a 1440 block unlock delay, which will be needed to wait before spending funds controlled by the ID after unlocking the ID (about one day unlock time).
The third example will unlock an ID that has been locked with an unlock delay, and the unlock time will be set to the block height at which the ID was unlocked + the originally set unlock delay.

## Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

## Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`


## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
   ```
   verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
   ```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
   ```
   verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
   verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
   ```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
   ```
   verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
   ```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
   ```
   verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
   ```

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## Testnet Reset

# Announcing NON-MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED Verus v0.9.0-2. This release is considered non-mandatory but IS RECOMMENDED for mainnet users, Komodo notaries, and is mandatory for testnet users to ensure reliable connection to the current testnet.

## TO REMAIN CONNECTED TO THE MAINNET VERUS BLOCKCHAIN, YOU MUST UPGRADE FULL NODES TO v0.9.0 OR LATER. IF YOU HAVE NOT UPDATED AND ATTEMPTED TO STAY CONNECT TO MAINNET, YOU MAY NEED TO BOOTSTRAP OR RESYNC YOUR NATIVE WALLET OR NODE AFTER UPGRADING.

## New Command and API for Verus Vault - setidentitytimelock
v0.9.0-2 introduces a new command and RPC API, "setidentitytimelock". setidentitytimelock may be used to set a time unlock delay, set a lock until a specific block height, or unlock a delayed timelock on a VerusID under your control.

You can use setidentitytimelock in one of two ways:
```
verus setidentitytimelock '{"unlockatblock":1796500}' (returntx)
```
or
```
verus setidentitytimelock '{"setunlockdelay":1440}' (returntx)
```
or
```
verus setidentitytimelock '{"unlockatblock":0}' (returntx)
```
The first example will lock the ID until the block specified. If the block specified is in the past, the ID will not be locked.
The second example will set a 1440 block unlock delay, which will be needed to wait before spending funds controlled by the ID after unlocking the ID (about one day unlock time).
The third example will unlock an ID that has been locked with an unlock delay, and the unlock time will be set to the block height at which the ID was unlocked + the originally set unlock delay.

## Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

## Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`


## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
   ```
   verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
   ```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
   ```
   verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
   verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
   ```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
   ```
   verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
   ```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
   ```
   verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
   ```

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json

```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json

```



## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# Announcing NON-MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED Verus v0.9.0-1. This release is considered non-mandatory but IS RECOMMENDED for mainnet users, Komodo notaries, and is mandatory for testnet users to ensure reliable connection to the current testnet.

## TO REMAIN CONNECTED TO THE MAINNET VERUS BLOCKCHAIN, YOU MUST UPGRADE FULL NODES TO v0.9.0 OR LATER BY BLOCK 1796400, which is expected to occur on or around Monday, November 29th at 6:15PM UTC.

## Verus ID and NFT Marketplace
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don’t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

## Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyoe with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`


## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
   ```
   verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
   ```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
   ```
   verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
   verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
   ```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
   ```
   verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
   ```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
   ```
   verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
   ```

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
{
"name": "PBaaSChain",
"options": 330,
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST"
],
"conversions": [
1
],
"eras": [
{
"reward": 1200000000,
"decay": 0,
"halving": 0,
"eraend": 0
}
],
"notaries": [
"Notary1@",
"Notary2@",
"Notary3@",
],
"minnotariesconfirm": 2,
"nodes": [
{
"networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node1@"
},
{
  "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node2@"
}
],
"gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
"gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
{
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST",
"PBaaSChain",
"USD"
],
"initialcontributions": [
380228.12033701,
0,
1000000
],
"initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":330,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

It’s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

## Verus Vault
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.

A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyoe with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

## Testnet Reset
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`


## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
   ```
   verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
   ```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
   ```
   verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
   verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
   ```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
   ```
   verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
   ```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
   ```
   verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
   ```

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
{
"name": "PBaaSChain",
"options": 330,
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST"
],
"conversions": [
1
],
"eras": [
{
"reward": 1200000000,
"decay": 0,
"halving": 0,
"eraend": 0
}
],
"notaries": [
"Notary1@",
"Notary2@",
"Notary3@",
],
"minnotariesconfirm": 2,
"nodes": [
{
"networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node1@"
},
{
  "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node2@"
}
],
"gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
"gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
{
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST",
"PBaaSChain",
"USD"
],
"initialcontributions": [
380228.12033701,
0,
1000000
],
"initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":330,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# Announcing immediate availability of GUI and CLI for all platforms of the NON-MANDATORY v0.8.0-5 UPDATE - ONLY REQUIRED FOR THOSE CONTINUING TO HELP GET TESTNET READY FOR MAINNET

We want to thank the Verus Community for bearing with the number of updates we've had to get the bridge to Ethereum working smoothly. This release both fixes the remaining known bridge issues and adds security to ensure that you don't send to an unspendable address on any network by using the wrong format for a destination.

The good news is that throughout the whole process of this first bridge release on testnet, we've been able to update through the issues we've seen without a reset and have not lost a single satoshi of test funds (which is not to say it is fully hardened quite yet). At this point, we hope and believe that this is the last update in this round of testnet, which will allow us to get back to focusing on the mainnet release and not asking those testing to update until we are very close to a mainnet release.

Once more, we will ask that you shut down the old version now, and we will restart the notarizations and transaction flow between Ethereum and Verus at 5 AM UTC time.

Thank you to everyone who helped with all the testing and exposing of issues that enabled us to make maybe even inconveniently quick progress.

If you miss the fork for this version at the above time you can get back on the correct chain by stopping Verus and deleting deleting everything  other than your wallet.dat file in your data directory at:
- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest`

## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
   ```
   verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
   ```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
   ```
   verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
   verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
   ```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
   ```
   verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
   ```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
   ```
   verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Defining a PBaaS blockchain

```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json

```



## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# Announcing immediate availability of GUI and CLI for all platforms of the NON-MANDATORY v0.8.0-4 UPDATE.

This release has no mainnet changes, resolves issues that people using testnet have reported with the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge, and is mandatory for those who wish to continue using testnet after transactions between the Verus and Rinkeby testnets resume flowing.

If you have pending transactions on the bridge, some requested conversions may come back as refunded, and you should receive all amounts expected, less fees. We will not reset the testnet, but within an hour after this availability, the network will resume transaction imports/exports to and from Rinkeby, and anyone who continues running the old version may need to resync to testnet from scratch to continue. If you have upgraded to v0.8.0-4 or do so before connecting again to testnet, you should only see improvement without disruption.

I want to thank everyone who participated already in using this testnet and bridge release. I hope we can keep that level of participation or more up, as it has been extremely helpful. Because of all that’s happened on this testnet to date, we were able to make a lot of progress in finding and resolving the following testnet issues in this release:

1. Enable support for much larger proofs than was previously possible from systems that either have large proofs required or significantly variable length proofs. Having this capability in the daemon will pave the way for more types of cross-chain proving in the future as well.
2. Fix failed refunds of conversion transactions attempted after a fractional currency launches, but before it’s preconversion phase is complete. If you sent transactions during this time, you may have stuck refunds that should flow after this upgrade.
3. Ensure that currencies are marked as “launch complete” immediately after all preconversions have been processed, enabling normal conversions in all directions from that point forward.
4. Fix an issue that left some import notarizations incomplete and caused cross-chain transfers to wait longer than expected after some imports.
5. Improve and validate hardening.

If you miss the fork for this version at the above time you can get back on the correct chain by stopping Verus and deleting deleting everything  other than your wallet.dat file in your data directory at:
- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest`

## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
   ```
   verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
   ```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
   ```
   verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
   verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
   ```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
   ```
   verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
   ```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
   ```
   verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
   ```

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.

```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

# Announcing immediate availability of GUI and CLI for all platforms of the NON-MANDATORY v0.8.0-3 UPDATE.

THIS UPDATE IS ONLY NEEDED FOR THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS USING TESTNET. THERE ARE NO MAINNET CHANGES IN THIS VERSION.

You will need this update to stay connected to testnet once we restart bridge traffic in about an hour. If you do stay connected on the old version and fork away from testnet, you should still be able to start with a reindex and rescan after upgrade.

v0.8.0 Updates include:

1. Testnet reset with fixes for all reported PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID user issues. If you had reported issues, please verify that the issues you reported are addressed in this release.
2. Support for the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge, which has been testing on private networks and which we hope to launch within a day or two after first vetting it on the release testing network with community test volunteers.
3. Support for the new `getvdxfid` RPC call, used along with your ID and published names to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys, which community members used to create the world’s first self-sovereign, completely decentralized, rent-free, non-cancelable social media profiles as can be seen here: https://luckpool.net/profile/identity/mike.vrsc . Work is underway to document the VDXF keys defined and used for profiles as well as the process of setting up your own. While the capability is already extremely powerful, we should remind everyone that Verus is a platform, not a social network. The core technology is exciting, but what will be even more exciting is when businesses and entrepreneurs leverage it to enable new, self-sovereign user experiences, applications, and accompanying businesses to enable the future, truly decentralized web.
4. Fix for the Electron certificate issue in the GUI wallet, which has been affecting prices and preventing BTC fee calculation.
5. Support for some additional, popular ERC20 currencies, in anticipation of more usage after release of the ETH bridge.
6. Fix in GUI for calculated balances of specific addresses sometimes showing lower than actual, even though wallet balance displayed correctly.
7. Additional hardening, fixes and improvement focused on mainnet and the Ethereum bridge.

To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\VRSC\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\VRSC\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
   ```
   verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
   ```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
   ```
   verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
   verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
   ```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
   ```
   verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
   ```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
   ```
   verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
   ```

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

# Announcing immediate availability of GUI and CLI for all platforms of the NON-MANDATORY v0.8.0-2 UPDATE

This daemon release includes a fix that simplifies some bridge transactions, and is the version you should run on testnet when the Ethereum bridge does launch for a good experience.

v0.8.0 Updates include:

1. Testnet reset with fixes for all reported PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID user issues. If you had reported issues, please verify that the issues you reported are addressed in this release.
2. Support for the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge, which has been testing on private networks and which we hope to launch within a day or two after first vetting it on the release testing network with community test volunteers.
3. Support for the new `getvdxfid` RPC call, used along with your ID and published names to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys, which community members used to create the world’s first self-sovereign, completely decentralized, rent-free, non-cancelable social media profiles as can be seen here: https://luckpool.net/profile/identity/mike.vrsc . Work is underway to document the VDXF keys defined and used for profiles as well as the process of setting up your own. While the capability is already extremely powerful, we should remind everyone that Verus is a platform, not a social network. The core technology is exciting, but what will be even more exciting is when businesses and entrepreneurs leverage it to enable new, self-sovereign user experiences, applications, and accompanying businesses to enable the future, truly decentralized web.
4. Fix for the Electron certificate issue in the GUI wallet, which has been affecting prices and preventing BTC fee calculation.
5. Support for some additional, popular ERC20 currencies, in anticipation of more usage after release of the ETH bridge.
6. Fix in GUI for calculated balances of specific addresses sometimes showing lower than actual, even though wallet balance displayed correctly.
7. Additional hardening, fixes and improvement focused on mainnet and the Ethereum bridge.

To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\VRSC\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\VRSC\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
   ```
   verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
   ```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
   ```
   verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
   verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
   ```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
   ```
   verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
   ```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
   ```
   verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
   ```

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
{
"name": "PBaaSChain",
"options": 330,
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST"
],
"conversions": [
1
],
"eras": [
{
"reward": 1200000000,
"decay": 0,
"halving": 0,
"eraend": 0
}
],
"notaries": [
"Notary1@",
"Notary2@",
"Notary3@",
],
"minnotariesconfirm": 2,
"nodes": [
{
"networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node1@"
},
{
  "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node2@"
}
],
"gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
"gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
{
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST",
"PBaaSChain",
"USD"
],
"initialcontributions": [
380228.12033701,
0,
1000000
],
"initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":330,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## Testnet Reset
The testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**
**Linux:**

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
{
"name": "PBaaSChain",
"options": 330,
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST"
],
"conversions": [
1
],
"eras": [
{
"reward": 1200000000,
"decay": 0,
"halving": 0,
"eraend": 0
}
],
"notaries": [
"Notary1@",
"Notary2@",
"Notary3@",
],
"minnotariesconfirm": 2,
"nodes": [
{
"networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node1@"
},
{
  "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node2@"
}
],
"gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
"gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
{
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST",
"PBaaSChain",
"USD"
],
"initialcontributions": [
380228.12033701,
0,
1000000
],
"initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":330,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

# Announcing immediate availability of GUI and CLI for all platforms of the NON-MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED v0.8.0 UPDATE.
This release is mandatory for those who want to use the testnet, which will be reset as of v0.8.0.

Updates include:

1. Testnet reset with fixes for all reported PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID user issues. If you had reported issues, please verify that the issues you reported are addressed in this release.
2. Support for the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge, which has been testing on private networks and which we hope to launch within a day or two after first vetting it on the release testing network with community test volunteers.
3. Support for the new `getvdxfid` RPC call, used along with your ID and published names to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys, which community members used to create the world’s first self-sovereign, completely decentralized, rent-free, non-cancelable social media profiles as can be seen here: https://luckpool.net/profile/identity/mike.vrsc . Work is underway to document the VDXF keys defined and used for profiles as well as the process of setting up your own. While the capability is already extremely powerful, we should remind everyone that Verus is a platform, not a social network. The core technology is exciting, but what will be even more exciting is when businesses and entrepreneurs leverage it to enable new, self-sovereign user experiences, applications, and accompanying businesses to enable the future, truly decentralized web.
4. Fix for the Electron certificate issue in the GUI wallet, which has been affecting prices and preventing BTC fee calculation.
5. Support for some additional, popular ERC20 currencies, in anticipation of more usage after release of the ETH bridge.
6. Fix in GUI for calculated balances of specific addresses sometimes showing lower than actual, even though wallet balance displayed correctly.
7. Additional hardening, fixes and improvement focused on mainnet and the Ethereum bridge.

To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
- Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\VRSC\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\VRSC\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
   ```
   verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
   ```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
   ```
   verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
   verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
   ```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
   ```
   verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
   ```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
   ```
   verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
   ```

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains.

The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon.

While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries

## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## Testnet Reset

# ANNOUNCING HIGHLY RECOMMENDED NON-MANDATORY, CRITICAL FOR NOTARIES AND POOLS UPDATE, v0.7.4.

Version v0.7.4 can improve a node’s synchronization and this version also upgrades and resets the Verus testnet, preparing it for the testnet launch of the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge and bringing Verus PBaaS multi-chain, multi-currency, Verus Vault ID timelocking, Verus MEV-resistant DeFi, and the Ethereum bridge much closer to a mainnet ready state.

This release fixes all known functionality issues reported from the previous testnet including some related to currency and blockchain launches, as well as being incorrectly able to reduce the timelock period on a Verus Vault locked ID. It also includes the ability to export an ID from one chain to another, using the “exportid”:true parameter in sendcurrency, enabling cross-chain use of VerusIDs. With this release, we will be resetting the Verus testnet. To use the new testnet, you must make sure to delete the vrsctest and .verustest/pbaas or VerusTest\pbaas folders beforehand.

In addition to being prepared for the Ethereum bridge launch, this release adds some new testnet capabilities, including the ability to send to IDs cross chain and export IDs from chain to chain using the `“exportid”:true` parameter with `sendcurrency`. IDs only need to be exported once and can then be used and managed directly as a forked ID on the destination chain.

## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain
   ```
   verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
   ```

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
   ```
   verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
   verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
   ```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
   ```
   verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
   ```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
   ```
   verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
   ```

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**

Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## Announcing NON-MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED UPDATE FOCUSED ON NETWORK CONNECTIVITY AND ROBUSTNESS IMPROVEMENTS v 0.7.3-10.
v0.7.3-10 has very minimal updates targeted at networking robustness - faster response to notary inconsistencies and a check for detecting a corrupt index that if present, might otherwise prevent a node from staying synced.

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
   ```
   verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
   verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
   ```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
   ```
   verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
   ```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
   ```
   verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
   ```

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
{
"name": "PBaaSChain",
"options": 330,
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST"
],
"conversions": [
1
],
"eras": [
{
"reward": 1200000000,
"decay": 0,
"halving": 0,
"eraend": 0
}
],
"notaries": [
"Notary1@",
"Notary2@",
"Notary3@",
],
"minnotariesconfirm": 2,
"nodes": [
{
"networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node1@"
},
{
  "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node2@"
}
],
"gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
"gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
{
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST",
"PBaaSChain",
"USD"
],
"initialcontributions": [
380228.12033701,
0,
1000000
],
"initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":330,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## Announcing immediate availability of NON-MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED ESPECIALLY FOR NOTARIES, HIGH PEER COUNT PUBLIC NODES, AND POOLS, v0.7.3-9 Verus CLI.

In addition to more immediate and effective bad node banning behavior, v0.7.3-9 includes a fix for signrawtransaction that could sometimes result in failure of countersigning a multisig, ID-based raw transaction.

While this release does include network robustness and a multisig fix, we were also able to upgrade Verus multisig capabilities to an ease of use and level of capability beyond other networks we are aware of today. In this release, it is now possible, on both mainnet and testnet, to issue any “sendcurrency” command with the source being a multisig ID, for which you do not have all the keys present in your wallet. If you do, there will be a return error in operation status, from both GUI or CLI, and in that error will be the partially signed transaction, which can be used by applications or with copy and paste to send to other signers with partial authority over the source ID. On mainnet, destinations for such a transaction can include IDs, private addresses with memos to a z-address or ID:private, and transparent addresses. On testnet, such transactions can include all that is possible on mainnet as well as multiple currencies, currency conversions, and cross-chain sends.

To our knowledge, this release raises the industry standard for multisig capability and its support on public blockchain protocols to a new level, even before considering the multisig revocation and recovery capabilities.

## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
Create transaction, get raw transaction data:
   ```
   verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
   verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
   ```
Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
   ```
   verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
   ```
After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
   ```
   verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
   ```

When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json

  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
{

"options": 330,
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST"
],
"conversions": [
1

  "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node2@"
}
],
"gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
"gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json

"initialcontributions": [
380228.12033701,

1000000
],
"initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":330,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## Announcing MANDATORY UPDATE v0.7.3-8, which will re-enable full Verus Proof of Power, including staking, at block 1576200, occuring on Thursday at approximately 5:00PM UTC time. YOU MUST UPDATE BEFORE THEN TO FOLLOW THE MAIN CHAIN.

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.

## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.

./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

Announcing MANDATORY UPGRADE v0.7.3-7. This release fixes the bug that was exploited by over the last day which stalled the network. You must upgrade to this release. If you shut down prior to block 15679999 you should be able to run this release without any additional steps. If your wallet continued to run after block 15679999 (or is still running) you will need to bootstrap or otherwise re-sync.

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Defining a PBaaS blockchain

"initialcontributions": [
380228.12033701,
0,
1000000
],
"initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":330,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```

There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json

"options": 330,
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST"
],
"conversions": [
1
],
"eras": [

"Notary1@",
"Notary2@",
"Notary3@",
],
"minnotariesconfirm": 2,
"nodes": [

"networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node1@"
},

  "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node2@"
}
],
"gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
"gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
{
"currencies": [

"initialcontributions": [
380228.12033701,
0,
1000000
],
"initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":330,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

Announcing NON-MANDATORY GUI upgrade  v0.7.3-5, required to continue participating in the PBaaS enabled testnet. v0.7.3-5 resolves an ID wallet sync issue for mainnet that could occur when recovering a revoked ID, causing the wallet to double count some amounts. This issue could not result in either loss of funds nor a security issue. This release also resolves all known testnet issues on the current testnet and does not require a testnet reset.

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto.

of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

Announcing NON-MANDATORY CLI upgrade  v0.7.3-4, required for to continue participating in the PBaaS enabled testnet.  Mainnet features are effectively unchanged from  v0.7.3-3


## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Defining a PBaaS blockchain

```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json

v0.7.3-3  is a CRITICAL update with fixes for potential, targeted DOS attacks that do not affect overall network security, but should be considered mandatory for exchanges, pools, and businesses using the Verus network.  Previous 0.7.3-x releases should no longer be used and should be replaced by this version.

While this release includes testnet functionality for Verus PBaaS, described below. This is a mainnet focused release that does not fix any issues on testnet. Testnet issues will be address in upcoming optional releases.

## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet
With an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.

As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.

## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.

## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID
- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.
## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)
- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.
## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming
 - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.
## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets
- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.
## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches
 - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.
## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)
- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.
## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**
- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.
## Locking and Unlocking IDs
- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
## Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.


## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private):**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```json
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
- **Converting PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST:**
  ```json
  verus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSCTEST","exportto":"VRSCTEST","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]'
  ```
## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## Defining a PBaaS blockchain
```json
{
"name": "PBaaSChain",
"options": 330,
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST"
],
"conversions": [
1
],
"eras": [
{
"reward": 1200000000,
"decay": 0,
"halving": 0,
"eraend": 0
}
],
"notaries": [
"Notary1@",
"Notary2@",
"Notary3@",
],
"minnotariesconfirm": 2,
"nodes": [
{
"networkaddress": "111.111.111.111:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node1@"
},
{
  "networkaddress": "111.111.111.112:10000",
"nodeidentity": "Node2@"
}
],
"gatewayconvertername": "Bridge",
"gatewayconverterissuance": 1000000
}
```
The bridge definition has overridable defaults
```json
{
"currencies": [
"VRSCTEST",
"PBaaSChain",
"USD"
],
"initialcontributions": [
380228.12033701,
0,
1000000
],
"initialsupply": 3000000
}
```

Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`
```json
./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{"name":"PBaaSChain","options":330,"currencies":["VRSCTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["VRSCTEST","PBaaSChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
```



## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:
1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is “don’t do that”. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.

2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.

## The Verus DeFi Testnet -- THERE IS NO TESTNET RESET
All new 'sendcurrency' features described above now work on both mainnet and testnet. In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well.

This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever released, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it’s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel. You can use this link as an invite to the Verus Discord: https://discord.gg/gecZsCf

- **DeFi and cross-currency liquidity integrated with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm**  - This is a massive set of platform capabilities that take DeFi further than any project in crypto today. We will list it here and describe it below. Using it is simple. Understanding the implications of what such a protocol can do when rent free and integrated in a truly decentralized public blockchain is a process of realizations that is likely to be similar to layers of an onion. We will do our best to explain below.

- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.

- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.

- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.

### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities
On the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.

The Verus Vault use case, which was originally described in the conception of the feature, is the ability to timelock an ID, which would prevent any spending of any funds controlled by that ID, while still allowing the ID and all its funds to be used for staking. If the timelock was set for one day when locked, the unlock operation itself will require a waiting period of one day, which can only be circumvented by a revocation followed by recovery operation. In practice, this means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds (though they could stake them and delegate rewards to another address, which you could immediately see) unless they unlock the ID first and wait one day. If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone other than you, you can revoke and recover before any funds are lost at all. If you wanted to get extremely secure, to the point of covering a case where someone may steal your private keys without you knowing and then lay in wait until you unlock your identity, so they can pounce on your funds before you lock it again, you can actually modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it, which ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys. While we believe this unique Verus technology actually provides for fully theft-proof workflows and protection of all assets on the network under the control of an ID, we will generally refer to the technology as "theft-resistant" and disclaim all guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose as part of the "experimental software" disclaimer.

In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.

- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.

### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```

## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.

```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

**Launching the testnet:**
```
./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST
```

Announcing NON-MANDATORY CLI upgrade v0.7.2-7, with fixes necessary to continue participating in the current testnet. Mainnet features are effectively unchanged from v0.7.2-6.

## The Verus DeFi Testnet -- THERE IS NO TESTNET RESET
All new 'sendcurrency' features described above now work on both mainnet and testnet. In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well.

This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever released, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it’s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel. You can use this link as an invite to the Verus Discord: https://discord.gg/gecZsCf

- **DeFi and cross-currency liquidity integrated with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm**  - This is a massive set of platform capabilities that take DeFi further than any project in crypto today. We will list it here and describe it below. Using it is simple. Understanding the implications of what such a protocol can do when rent free and integrated in a truly decentralized public blockchain is a process of realizations that is likely to be similar to layers of an onion. We will do our best to explain below.

- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.

- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.

- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.

### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities
On the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.

The Verus Vault use case, which was originally described in the conception of the feature, is the ability to timelock an ID, which would prevent any spending of any funds controlled by that ID, while still allowing the ID and all its funds to be used for staking. If the timelock was set for one day when locked, the unlock operation itself will require a waiting period of one day, which can only be circumvented by a revocation followed by recovery operation. In practice, this means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds (though they could stake them and delegate rewards to another address, which you could immediately see) unless they unlock the ID first and wait one day. If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone other than you, you can revoke and recover before any funds are lost at all. If you wanted to get extremely secure, to the point of covering a case where someone may steal your private keys without you knowing and then lay in wait until you unlock your identity, so they can pounce on your funds before you lock it again, you can actually modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it, which ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys. While we believe this unique Verus technology actually provides for fully theft-proof workflows and protection of all assets on the network under the control of an ID, we will generally refer to the technology as "theft-resistant" and disclaim all guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose as part of the "experimental software" disclaimer.

In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.

- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.

### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```

## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

**Launching the testnet:**
```
./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST
```

So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

**Launching the testnet:**
```
./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST
```

Announcing NON-MANDATORY CLI upgrade v0.7.2-5, with fixes that only apply to testnet. Mainnet features are unchanged from v0.7.2-4.
This release includes the following improvements and updates:
- Fix testnet transaction funding issue for multi-currency `sendcurrency` commands
- Fix testnet currency conversions

## The Verus DeFi Testnet -- THERE IS NO TESTNET RESET
All new 'sendcurrency' features described above now work on both mainnet and testnet. In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well.

This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever released, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it’s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel. You can use this link as an invite to the Verus Discord: https://discord.gg/gecZsCf

- **DeFi and cross-currency liquidity integrated with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm**  - This is a massive set of platform capabilities that take DeFi further than any project in crypto today. We will list it here and describe it below. Using it is simple. Understanding the implications of what such a protocol can do when rent free and integrated in a truly decentralized public blockchain is a process of realizations that is likely to be similar to layers of an onion. We will do our best to explain below.

- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.

- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.

- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.

### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities
On the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.

The Verus Vault use case, which was originally described in the conception of the feature, is the ability to timelock an ID, which would prevent any spending of any funds controlled by that ID, while still allowing the ID and all its funds to be used for staking. If the timelock was set for one day when locked, the unlock operation itself will require a waiting period of one day, which can only be circumvented by a revocation followed by recovery operation. In practice, this means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds (though they could stake them and delegate rewards to another address, which you could immediately see) unless they unlock the ID first and wait one day. If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone other than you, you can revoke and recover before any funds are lost at all. If you wanted to get extremely secure, to the point of covering a case where someone may steal your private keys without you knowing and then lay in wait until you unlock your identity, so they can pounce on your funds before you lock it again, you can actually modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it, which ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys. While we believe this unique Verus technology actually provides for fully theft-proof workflows and protection of all assets on the network under the control of an ID, we will generally refer to the technology as "theft-resistant" and disclaim all guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose as part of the "experimental software" disclaimer.

In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.

- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.

### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```

## v0.7.2-4 WITH THE WORLD'S FIRST FRIENDLY-NAME, zk-SNARK ADDRESSES FOR MAINNET AND TESTNET
Announcing NON-MANDATORY CLI upgrade v0.7.2-4 with the world's first friendly-name private z-address support for sending and receiving funds and messages, including the following improvements and updates:
- `sendcurrency` can now use sapling addresses as native currency funding sources and destinations for any transaction.
- An identity's z-address can now be referenced as a funding source or destination by appending `:private` to an ID (eg. `"idname@:private"`). This form of z-address will also be able to be used with the z_getbalance command.
- New wildcards can also be used as funds sources in the 'sendcurrency' command and parameters to z_getbalance that include:
   - All transparent addresses in the wallet (both R-addresses and IDs)
        `"*"``
   - All R-addresses in the wallet
        `"R*"`
   - All IDs controlled by the wallet
        `"i*"`
- `sendcurrency` will now be an asynchronous API that will return an operation ID, as `z_sendmany` does, and complete in the background. It will also have its status available through `z_getoperationstatus`.

**NOTE:** Due to the zero knowledge nature of z-addresses, a z-address is an endpoint in your VerusID which can be changed if you revoke and recover an ID, funds held on a private address or endpoint are not able to be redirected to the newly recovered ID unless you still have control over the z-address itself. Transparent funds controlled by an ID are recovered when the ID is revoked and recovered, even if you have lost the keys. This is a fundamental limitation of zero-knowledge privacy, not an error and not something to be fixed. Please consider this when using friendly-name private addresses as funds and not just message endpoints.

On the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.

The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.

- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.

The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.

### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```

## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

Announcing NON-MANDATORY upgrade v0.7.2-3 with the following improvements and fixes:
- Fixes a rare issue in wallet synchronization for IDs that have been transferred between wallets in a specific combination of transfers and spends of prior outputs. In the cases seen, the wallet maintained some outputs as unspent, when in fact they were spent on the blockchain. We have seen a very small number of people hit this issue after transferring IDs between owners and/or separate wallets and having spent prior outputs on transactions that still have valid UTXOs to the ID. If you have encountered such an issue, this version will properly synchronize the wallet with a full rescan. If you have not, use of this version will prevent the issue from ever occurring.
- Stricter updateidentity paramater checks to ensure that revocation and recovery IDs are already registered, valid IDs on the blockchain before accepting a change

## Testnet Reset

## The New Verus DeFi Testnet
This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever announced, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it’s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel. You can use this link as an invite to the Verus Discord: https://discord.gg/gecZsCf

- **DeFi and cross-currency liquidity integrated with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm**  - This is a massive set of platform capabilities that take DeFi further than any project in crypto today. We will list it here and describe it below. Using it is simple. Understanding the implications of what such a protocol can do when rent free and integrated in a truly decentralized public blockchain is a process of realizations that is likely to be similar to layers of an onion. We will do our best to explain below.

- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.

- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.

- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.

### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities
On the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.

The Verus Vault use case, which was originally described in the conception of the feature, is the ability to timelock an ID, which would prevent any spending of any funds controlled by that ID, while still allowing the ID and all its funds to be used for staking. If the timelock was set for one day when locked, the unlock operation itself will require a waiting period of one day, which can only be circumvented by a revocation followed by recovery operation. In practice, this means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds (though they could stake them and delegate rewards to another address, which you could immediately see) unless they unlock the ID first and wait one day. If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone other than you, you can revoke and recover before any funds are lost at all. If you wanted to get extremely secure, to the point of covering a case where someone may steal your private keys without you knowing and then lay in wait until you unlock your identity, so they can pounce on your funds before you lock it again, you can actually modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it, which ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys. While we believe this unique Verus technology actually provides for fully theft-proof workflows and protection of all assets on the network under the control of an ID, we will generally refer to the technology as "theft-resistant" and disclaim all guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose as part of the "experimental software" disclaimer.

In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.

- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.

### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```

## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```

Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

The Verus Vault use case, which was originally described in the conception of the feature, is the ability to timelock an ID, which would prevent any spending of any funds controlled by that ID, while still allowing the ID and all its funds to be used for staking. If the timelock was set for one day when locked, the unlock operation itself will require a waiting period of one day, which can only be circumvented by a revocation followed by recovery operation. In practice, this means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds (though they could stake them and delegate rewards to another address, which you could immediately see) unless they unlock the ID first and wait one day. If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone other than you, you can revoke and recover before any funds are lost at all. If you wanted to get extremely secure, to the point of covering a case where someone may steal your private keys without you knowing and then lay in wait until you unlock your identity, so they can pounce on your funds before you lock it again, you can actually modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it, which ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys. While we believe this unique Verus technology actually provides for fully theft-proof workflows and protection of all assets on the network under the control of an ID, we will generally refer to the technology as "theft-resistant" and disclaim all guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose as part of the "experimental software" disclaimer.

In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.

- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.

### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```

## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

**This update is required to continue participating on the testnet launched in v0.7.2**

Verus v0.7.2-1 is a non-mandatory but highly recommended Verus node and wallet upgrade, with fully decentralized finance and liquidity system activated on the new Verus testnet. While most of the new capabilities in this release are focused on testnet, the mainnet support does include some performance improvements and also fixes an issue that may occur in an edge case of revocation and recovery of IDs, which can result in a revoked ID being irrecoverable from an earlier version than v0.7.2.

## Testnet Reset
The testnet was deleted and relaunched on v0.7.2. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO v0.7.2, PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RELEASE NOTES  BEFORE RUNNING THIS UPDATE**

## The New Verus DeFi Testnet
This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever announced, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it’s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel. You can use this link as an invite to the Verus Discord: https://discord.gg/gecZsCf

- **DeFi and cross-currency liquidity integrated with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm**  - This is a massive set of platform capabilities that take DeFi further than any project in crypto today. We will list it here and describe it below. Using it is simple. Understanding the implications of what such a protocol can do when rent free and integrated in a truly decentralized public blockchain is a process of realizations that is likely to be similar to layers of an onion. We will do our best to explain below.

- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.

- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.

- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.

### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities
On the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.

The Verus Vault use case, which was originally described in the conception of the feature, is the ability to timelock an ID, which would prevent any spending of any funds controlled by that ID, while still allowing the ID and all its funds to be used for staking. If the timelock was set for one day when locked, the unlock operation itself will require a waiting period of one day, which can only be circumvented by a revocation followed by recovery operation. In practice, this means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds (though they could stake them and delegate rewards to another address, which you could immediately see) unless they unlock the ID first and wait one day. If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone other than you, you can revoke and recover before any funds are lost at all. If you wanted to get extremely secure, to the point of covering a case where someone may steal your private keys without you knowing and then lay in wait until you unlock your identity, so they can pounce on your funds before you lock it again, you can actually modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it, which ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys. While we believe this unique Verus technology actually provides for fully theft-proof workflows and protection of all assets on the network under the control of an ID, we will generally refer to the technology as "theft-resistant" and disclaim all guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose as part of the "experimental software" disclaimer.

In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.

- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.

### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```

## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```

```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'

- **DeFi and cross-currency liquidity integrated with blockchain processing, fees, VerusID, and Verus PoP, 51% hash-attack resistant consensus algorithm**  - This is a massive set of platform capabilities that take DeFi further than any project in crypto today. We will list it here and describe it below. Using it is simple. Understanding the implications of what such a protocol can do when rent free and integrated in a truly decentralized public blockchain is a process of realizations that is likely to be similar to layers of an onion. We will do our best to explain below.

- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.

- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.

- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.

### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities
On the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.

The Verus Vault use case, which was originally described in the conception of the feature, is the ability to timelock an ID, which would prevent any spending of any funds controlled by that ID, while still allowing the ID and all its funds to be used for staking. If the timelock was set for one day when locked, the unlock operation itself will require a waiting period of one day, which can only be circumvented by a revocation followed by recovery operation. In practice, this means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds (though they could stake them and delegate rewards to another address, which you could immediately see) unless they unlock the ID first and wait one day. If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone other than you, you can revoke and recover before any funds are lost at all. If you wanted to get extremely secure, to the point of covering a case where someone may steal your private keys without you knowing and then lay in wait until you unlock your identity, so they can pounce on your funds before you lock it again, you can actually modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it, which ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys. While we believe this unique Verus technology actually provides for fully theft-proof workflows and protection of all assets on the network under the control of an ID, we will generally refer to the technology as "theft-resistant" and disclaim all guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose as part of the "experimental software" disclaimer.

In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.

- **Time Lock:**
    The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 0, "timelock": <Unlock block height>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- **Time Delay:**
    The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{"name": "ID@", "flags": 2, "timelock": <Unlock block delay>, "minimumsignatures": 1, "primaryaddresses": ["t-address"]}'
    ```
- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.
- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.
### Conversion Queries
The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves
- **E.g. BTC ETH:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth
    ```
    Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.

### Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@","amount":10}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"BTC","via","VRSC-BTC"}]'
    ```
- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
    ```

## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocations":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":97, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":[20000]'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## New in v0.7.1-5
This non-mandatory release is compatible with mainnet with mininal changes from v0.7.1-1. It contains fixes necessary to continue participating in the testnet launched in v0.7.1-1, without reset of your wallet or holdings, if you started using the VRSCTEST multi-currency testnet in v0.7.1-1 or later. You should be able to synchronize easily, but if you are unable to synchronize VRSCTEST shortly after connecting, try deleting the data in your VRSCTEST folder, and retain the wallet.dat file.

# Verus Testnet with Multi-currency Fractional Reserves and Currency Launch Protocol
Verus multi-currency fractional reserve baskets are UTXO-based, fractional reserve currencies with anti-front running, simultaneously solved, provably fair liquidity system for all currencies and tokens in or imported into the PBaaS system.

While Verus daemon v0.7.1-5 has no improvements for mainnet operation, it offers full support for the new Verus Testnet multi-currency technology preview. On testnet, the new "sendcurrency" API, which is already available on Verus mainnet in its simplified form, is enhanced with new multi-currency parameters. The first parameter, "currency":"currencyname" - where the default on testnet for currency name is "vrsctest", specifies the source currency of the send. The next, "convertto":"currencyname", allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source.

# Enhancements to TestNet Protocols for Increased Scale, Currency Burn Functions, and Centralized Fractional Currencies
Version v0.7.1-5 is not yet considered hardened for mainnet, but has increased scale over previous versions in addition to the ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency. This allows price neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. This version also enables a new parameter to the "sendcurrency" API called "burn". If "burn" is set to 1, a currency sent, which must be a token or fractional currency is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.

# An end to front running
Conversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.

There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.

# The Best Way to Launch a Currency
Currency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!

Currencies can be launched to accept a range of other currencies and with or without fractional reserve capabilities. Verus import/export protocol was designed to make integration with other block chains provable and easy, and there are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, where currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network, and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.

# Preparing for Multi-chain, Dynamic Merge Mining
While this 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology which was running on testnet last year. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies as well.

## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
**Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
**Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@","amount":10}]'
```
**Converting VRSCTEST to another currency, TESTCOIN:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"TESTCOIN"}]'
```
**Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```

```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.

# The Best Way to Launch a Currency
Currency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!

Currencies can be launched to accept a range of other currencies and with or without fractional reserve capabilities. Verus import/export protocol was designed to make integration with other block chains provable and easy, and there are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, where currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network, and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.

# Preparing for Multi-chain, Dynamic Merge Mining
While this 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology which was running on testnet last year. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies as well.

## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
**Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
**Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@","amount":10}]'
```
**Converting VRSCTEST to another currency, TESTCOIN:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"TESTCOIN"}]'
```
**Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```




## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocation":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":96, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"conversions":[0.01, 1.0],"minpreconversion":[1000,1000]}'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

## New in v0.7.1-3
- This non-mandatory release is compatible with mainnet with mininal changes from v0.7.1-1. It contains fixes necessary to continue participating in the testnet launched in v0.7.1-1 and 0.7.1-2, without reset of your wallet or holdings, if you started using the VRSCTEST multi-currency testnet in v0.7.1-1 or "-2". You should be able to synchronize easily, but if you are unable to synchronize VRSCTEST shortly after connecting, try deleting the data in your VRSCTEST folder, and retain the wallet.dat file.
- Improved staking supply calculation

# Verus Testnet with Multi-currency Fractional Reserves and Currency Launch Protocol
Verus multi-currency fractional reserve baskets are UTXO-based, fractional reserve currencies with anti-front running, simultaneously solved, provably fair liquidity system for all currencies and tokens in or imported into the PBaaS system.

While Verus daemon v0.7.1-3 has minor improvements for mainnet operation, it offers full support for the new Verus Testnet multi-currency technology preview. On testnet, the new "sendcurrency" API, which is already available on Verus mainnet in its simplified form, is enhanced with new multi-currency parameters. The first parameter, "currency":"currencyname" - where the default on testnet for currency name is "vrsctest", specifies the source currency of the send. The next, "convertto":"currencyname", allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source.

# Enhancements to TestNet Protocols for Increased Scale, Currency Burn Functions, and Centralized Fractional Currencies
Version v0.7.1-3 is not yet considered hardened for mainnet, but has increased scale over previous versions in addition to the ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency. This allows price neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. This version also enables a new parameter to the "sendcurrency" API called "burn". If "burn" is set to 1, a currency sent, which must be a token or fractional currency is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.

# An end to front running
Conversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.

There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.

# The Best Way to Launch a Currency
Currency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!

Currencies can be launched to accept a range of other currencies and with or without fractional reserve capabilities. Verus import/export protocol was designed to make integration with other block chains provable and easy, and there are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, where currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network, and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.

```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

## New in v0.7.1-1
- Re-launched VRSCTEST with fixes. Make sure you delete your VRSCTEST data before connecting to the testnet.

# Verus Testnet with Multi-currency Fractional Reserves and Currency Launch Protocol
Verus multi-currency fractional reserve baskets are UTXO-based, fractional reserve currencies with anti-front running, simultaneously solved, provably fair liquidity system for all currencies and tokens in or imported into the PBaaS system.

While Verus daemon v0.7.1-1 has minor improvements for mainnet operation, it offers full support for the new Verus Testnet multi-currency technology preview. On testnet, the new "sendcurrency" API, which is already available on Verus mainnet in its simplified form, is enhanced with new multi-currency parameters. The first parameter, "currency":"currencyname" - where the default on testnet for currency name is "vrsctest", specifies the source currency of the send. The next, "convertto":"currencyname", allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source.

# An end to front running
Conversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.

There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.

# The Best Way to Launch a Currency
Currency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!

Currencies can be launched to accept a range of other currencies and with or without fractional reserve capabilities. Verus import/export protocol was designed to make integration with other block chains provable and easy, and there are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, where currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network, and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.

# Preparing for Multi-chain, Dynamic Merge Mining
While this 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology which was running on testnet last year. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies as well.

## Sending and Converting Currency
**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**

The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.
**Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]'
```
**Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@","amount":10}]'
```
**Converting VRSCTEST to another currency, TESTCOIN:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"bob@","amount":10, "convertto":"TESTCOIN"}]'
```
**Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"alice@","amount":10, "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]'
```




## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocation":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":96, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"conversions":[0.01, 1.0],"minpreconversion":[1000,1000]}'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

At block 1053660, the Verus Mainnet Protocol upgraded to the new Komodo Notary Nodes for Komodo dPoW notarization, season 4, and a number of new capabilities, as well as a change to the Verus Proof of Power staking and mining hash that is now live on Verus mainnet.


## The network upgrade activated the following features:
- Added support for season 4 Komodo notary node operators


- Coinbase shielding will no longer be required on any coinbases from the past that have not yet been shielded.

- Staking will now work on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds.


- A new “sendcurrency” API for the command line provides more control when sending from and to multiple addresses or identities.


- “updateidentity`  will now be able to change the case of characters in the name of a VerusID in the global locale.


- Revocation identity will now lose all control over an ID after revocation, including the ability to still change the revocation identity itself, which it used to retain. After revocation now, the recovery identity will have full control over the revoked ID.


- Staking and hashing consensus protocol updates with VerusHash 2.2

## New in v0.7.0-4
- Validate ID destination on `sendfrom`, `sendtoaddress`, `sendmany`, and `z_sendmany`

At block 1053660, the Verus Mainnet Protocol upgraded to the new Komodo Notary Nodes for Komodo dPoW notarization, season 4, and a number of new capabilities, as well as a change to the Verus Proof of Power staking and mining hash that is now live on Verus mainnet.

Although the network is running smoothly after the upgrade, an issue was identified and resolved in this release. In addition, a couple of user features, including restoring "-pubkey=hexpubkey" as a parameter for redirecting staking and mining rewards are included.

## The network upgrade activated the following features:
- Added support for season 4 Komodo notary node operators


- Coinbase shielding will no longer be required on any coinbases from the past that have not yet been shielded.

- Staking will now work on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds.


- A new �`sendcurrency` API for the command line provides more control when sending from and to multiple addresses or identities.


- `updateidentity`  will now be able to change the case of characters in the name of a VerusID in the global locale.


- Revocation identity will now lose all control over an ID after revocation, including the ability to still change the revocation identity itself, which it used to retain. After revocation now, the recovery identity will have full control over the revoked ID.


- Staking and hashing consensus protocol updates with VerusHash 2.2

This is a mainnet release with fix to prevent any recurrence of the recent minor fork at block 1002417 and integrated support for the new PBaaS testnet. This release is approved for use on mainnet nodes, and it is being released on Github prior to full GUI wallet release v0.6.5-2 to enable exchanges, pools, and infrastructure nodes to update immediately, as needed.

## Notable Changes:
- Added `getsaplingtree` API
- Added support for Verus Testnet with PBaaS Multi-currency Tokens
- Resolved multi-block reorg issue on mainnet that can prevent successful reorg in rare, otherwise valid cases

## Testnet Reset

# Verus PBaaS Multi-currency Tokens (TestNet only)

The testnet supports a completely new capability of token definitions and token launches (Kickstarter/Gofundme style, ICO, ITO, IPO, etc.). These tokens can be sent through the Verus protocol using the new 'sendcurrency' API, which works for all currencies in the Verus network. Tokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies as well. Token launches can accept multiple other coins or tokens for conversion to the new token with payment to the token ID. Each token can have a different conversion price for pre-launch participation as well as minimums and maximums of participation. If minimums are not met by the currency's startblock, all participation will be refunded, less a minimal transfer/network fee, which was already allocated to miners/stakers.

Tokens can be controlled by the blockchain and used for many purposes, including payment models, tickets, point systems, etc., or they can be partially blockchain controlled, centralized tokens, with currencies that are mintable at any time by the ID behind them. The controlling ID can also receive receive aggregated outgoing transactions to external systems that both burn coins and pass account data in the process. This will allow applications to control currency supplies on the public network, whether these applications are external, decentralized networks or centralized custodial systems, in many typical use cases of tokens, including club coins, game tokens, token launches, etc., no programming is required.

## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.
So, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,
that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocation":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":96, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"conversions":[0.01, 1.0],"minpreconversion":[1000,1000]}'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

that I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.
I also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, "my", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.
First, I could define the currency "gold" as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"gold","options":96,"currencies":["vrsctest"],"conversions":[0.01],"minpreconversion":[1000],"preallocation":[{"mike@":50000000.00000000}]}'
```
of course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to
initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.
all of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation
in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.
After it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
```
that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":96, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"conversions":[0.01, 1.0],"minpreconversion":[1000,1000]}'
```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
```

This release is intended for use in the VRSCTEST only. Mainnet approved testnet release is not yet available

# Verus Testnet PBaaS Multi-currency Tokens

The testnet supports a completely new capability of token definitions and token launches (Kickstarter/Gofundme style, ICO, ITO, IPO, etc.). These tokens can be sent through the Verus protocol using the new 'sendcurrency' API, which works for all currencies in the Verus network. Tokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies as well. Token launches can accept multiple other coins or tokens for conversion to the new token with payment to the token ID. Each token can have a different conversion price for pre-launch participation as well as minimums and maximums of participation. If minimums are not met by the currency's startblock, all participation will be refunded, less a minimal transfer/network fee, which was already allocated to miners/stakers.

Tokens can be controlled by the blockchain and used for many purposes, including payment models, tickets, point systems, etc., or they can be partially blockchain controlled, centralized tokens, with currencies that are mintable at any time by the ID behind them. The controlling ID can also receive receive aggregated outgoing transactions to external systems that both burn coins and pass account data in the process. This will allow applications to control currency supplies on the public network, whether these applications are external, decentralized networks or centralized custodial systems, in many typical use cases of tokens, including club coins, game tokens, token launches, etc., no programming is required.

## Defining a Currency

To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.

```
In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'

# Verus CLI v0.6.4-3

### Worldwide Verifiable Digital Signatures for All!
Verus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer the first worldwide verifiable, decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft.

Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.

Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables. It is also the foundation upon which many new applications and additional capabilities can be built.

For example, using Verus ID signatures, it’s possible for any journalist anywhere to sign photos, videos, and content, establish a reputation for authenticity, and counter the potential for deep-fakes to make the truth harder to find. Open source projects can now create their own identities and digitally sign their binary releases, ensuring that not only can a file be verified by hash as the one downloaded from a particular server, but by signature as the actual file initially signed by the developer or release engineer. Signatures also form the basis for any attestation of one party to the validity of another. In fact, there are so many applications for digital signatures, from things listed already, to physical entry systems, to workflow applications, to new earning opportunities that a full discussion of use cases would overwhelm these release notes.

In any case, we are happy to release digital signatures for all, and we hope you enjoy using this new, simple capability, maybe even think of a new use case you’d like to pursue yourself as a business opportunity on the Verus Network!


# Verus ID
Verus IDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. Verus IDs provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, Verus ID provides:

### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network
Verus IDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

### Fully Decentralized Protocol
Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:

- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.

- **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.

- **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.

# VerusHash 2.1
VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.

# Verus CLI v0.6.4

### Worldwide Verifiable Digital Signatures for All!
Verus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer the first worldwide verifiable, decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft.

Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.

Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables. It is also the foundation upon which many new applications and additional capabilities can be built.

For example, using Verus ID signatures, it’s possible for any journalist anywhere to sign photos, videos, and content, establish a reputation for authenticity, and counter the potential for deep-fakes to make the truth harder to find. Open source projects can now create their own identities and digitally sign their binary releases, ensuring that not only can a file be verified by hash as the one downloaded from a particular server, but by signature as the actual file initially signed by the developer or release engineer. Signatures also form the basis for any attestation of one party to the validity of another. In fact, there are so many applications for digital signatures, from things listed already, to physical entry systems, to workflow applications, to new earning opportunities that a full discussion of use cases would overwhelm these release notes.

In any case, we are happy to release digital signatures for all, and we hope you enjoy using this new, simple capability, maybe even think of a new use case you’d like to pursue yourself as a business opportunity on the Verus Network!


# Verus ID
Verus IDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. Verus IDs provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, Verus ID provides:

### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network
Verus IDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

### Fully Decentralized Protocol
Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:

- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.

- **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.

- **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.

# VerusHash 2.1
VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.

At block 800200, The Verus mainnet protocol was updated to include VerusID. This update is the latest for the upgraded Verus mainnet.

# Notable Changes
- Fix accretion of coinbases in mempool

# Verus ID
VerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. VerusIDs provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, VerusID provides:

### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network
VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

### Fully Decentralized Protocol
Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. VerusIDs are:

- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.

- **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.

- **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.

# Notable Changes
* This update fixes an issue which would ban nodes too aggressively, resulting in disconnection from the chain and potential to fork away from the main chain. This should be considered a mandatory update.
- Add cansign and canspend to getidentity

This release includes activation support for VerusID, and relative adjustment to the CPU and FPGA-equalizing VerusHash 2.1 Algorithm

**AT BLOCK 800200, THE VERUS MAINNET PROTOCOL HARDFORKED. THIS UPDATE IS MANDATORY TO REMAIN ON THE VERUS MAINNET.

# Verus ID
VerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. VerusIDs provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, VerusID provides:

### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network
VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

### Fully Decentralized Protocol
Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. VerusIDs are:

- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.

- **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.

- **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.
# VerusHash 2.1
VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.

# Notable Changes
- Set content hashes will be a key/value map instead of an array
- Improve invalid block and invalid transaction handling.

# Verus ID and VerusHash 2.1 Network Upgrade
This is the third release candidate (RC3) for the next major upgrade to the Verus network. It is considered fully ready for testing on both VRSCTEST testnet and VRSC mainnet. While this release is likely to work fine on mainnet through the coming activation, it is not yet an official release that you should expect to support mainnet activation. If you install this version, please make sure to upgrade to an official release before network activation, which will happen at block 800200, expected to be mined or staked on December 15th.
This release enables two technology upgrades, one that would be considered big news to most cryptocurrency projects, an improvement to the FPGA-equalizing hash algorithm, and a revolutionary, new decentralized identity technology, Verus IDs, that will disrupt today’s centralized systems with the most secure, quantum ready, fully decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity system in the world.
## Verus ID
Verus ID includes built-in privacy at the core through integration of zk-SNARKs, and provides a revolutionary improvement to blockchain address security, making it possible to actually recover your money after losing your keys, secure against identity and key theft, prove things about yourself without having to show more details than needed, and transfer assets to heirs as part of your estate.
This release also introduces a new smart transaction technology that is unique to the Verus network and replaces its use of Komodo compatible crypto-conditions. The Verus ID system was made possible through the use of Verus Smart Transactions, which will be available for everyone to use on their own blockchains in the upcoming PBaaS network upgrade. Verus Smart Transactions use standard Bitcoin style serialization rather than the ASN.1 used in crypto conditions, which makes support on lite or mobile wallets simpler to implement than the crypto-condition protocol, which is still used on the Verus network for Stake Guard.
## VerusHash 2.1
VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.

# Verus ID - A Better Blockchain Identity Technology
If you’ve been around crypto for even a little while, you’ll start to hear things like “not your keys, not your coins”, “lose your keys, lose your coins”. If you lose your keys, no one will ever be able to recover your money.

In fact, trading off decentralized, censorship resistant public systems for this risk to your cryptocurrency assets is such a fundamental issue in blockchain systems today that it is considered an acceptable price for having the benefit of full control over your own funds and blockchain assets.

Verus ID provides an elegant solution to these previously unsolved, fundamental problems, and also provides quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities that provide the following advantages over today’s blockchain systems:

1. Identity and currency address are one and the same. Your friendly name can be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer.
2. Each identity must have a set of addresses (1 or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. Each identity also refers to two additional identities that have authority over:
    - **Primary** - this is the self identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.
    - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.
    - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.
3. Identities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party’s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.
4. If an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using `z_getbalance identity@”`.
5. If later, a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure s added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well. That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.

## Making a new identity
Arguably, the hardest part of the new Verus identity technology is just making your first identity, especially without a GUI. Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ ‘[{“address”:”alice@”, “amount”:100}]’
```
or
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100
```
Making a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. To prevent this name “front running”, you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.

Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows:


- 20 VRSC to the referrer’s ID
- 20 VRSC to the referrer’s referrer’s ID
- 20 VRSC to the referrer’s referrer’s referrer’s ID
- 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined

100% of all funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.

## To create an identity:

Create your commitment with the following command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registernamecommitment Name youraddressorid referrerfriendlyname@
That will respond with something like:
{
  "txid": "377576f8ada1acc2aeb013ddf7a9ad86756cb990d4c5fc70b5a9a0fca43d727e",

You then wait for the commitment to be mined into a block, then use the information returned above as follows:
```

```
As long as you have enough funds and you are registering a new identity on the blockchain, you will be able to use your new identity in place of an address as soon as the transaction created by the registration command is mined into the blockchain.
You may list the identities in your wallet with the command `listidentities`, and you may display specific identities with the command `getidentity`. If you have the authority, or use identities under your control as revocation or recovery authorities for other identities, you may also revoke and recovery identities as well.

# Notable Changes
- Improved Identity synchronization
- Cleaned up debug log output
- Set block space limit for Identities

# Verus ID and VerusHash 2.1 Network Upgrade
This is the second release candidate (RC2) for the next major upgrade to the Verus network. It is considered fully ready for testing on both VRSCTEST testnet and VRSC mainnet. While this release is likely to work fine on mainnet through the coming activation, it is not yet an official release that you should expect to support mainnet activation. If you install this version, please make sure to upgrade to an official release before network activation, which will happen at block 800200, expected to be mined or staked on December 15th.
This release enables two technology upgrades, one that would be considered big news to most cryptocurrency projects, an improvement to the FPGA-equalizing hash algorithm, and a revolutionary, new decentralized identity technology, Verus IDs, that will disrupt today’s centralized systems with the most secure, quantum ready, fully decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity system in the world.
## Verus ID
Verus ID includes built-in privacy at the core through integration of zk-SNARKs, and provides a revolutionary improvement to blockchain address security, making it possible to actually recover your money after losing your keys, secure against identity and key theft, prove things about yourself without having to show more details than needed, and transfer assets to heirs as part of your estate.
This release also introduces a new smart transaction technology that is unique to the Verus network and replaces its use of Komodo compatible crypto-conditions. The Verus ID system was made possible through the use of Verus Smart Transactions, which will be available for everyone to use on their own blockchains in the upcoming PBaaS network upgrade. Verus Smart Transactions use standard Bitcoin style serialization rather than the ASN.1 used in crypto conditions, which makes support on lite or mobile wallets simpler to implement than the crypto-condition protocol, which is still used on the Verus network for Stake Guard.
## VerusHash 2.1
VerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.

# Verus ID - A Better Blockchain Identity Technology
If you’ve been around crypto for even a little while, you’ll start to hear things like “not your keys, not your coins”, “lose your keys, lose your coins”. If you lose your keys, no one will ever be able to recover your money.

In fact, trading off decentralized, censorship resistant public systems for this risk to your cryptocurrency assets is such a fundamental issue in blockchain systems today that it is considered an acceptable price for having the benefit of full control over your own funds and blockchain assets.

Verus ID provides an elegant solution to these previously unsolved, fundamental problems, and also provides quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities that provide the following advantages over today’s blockchain systems:

1. Identity and currency address are one and the same. Your friendly name can be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer.
2. Each identity must have a set of addresses (1 or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. Each identity also refers to two additional identities that have authority over:
    - **Primary** - this is the self identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.
    - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.
    - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.
3. Identities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party’s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.
4. If an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using `z_getbalance identity@”`.
5. If later, a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure s added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well. That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.

## Making a new identity
Arguably, the hardest part of the new Verus identity technology is just making your first identity, especially without a GUI. Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ ‘[{“address”:”alice@”, “amount”:100}]’
```
or
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100
```
Making a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. To prevent this name “front running”, you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.

Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows:


- 20 VRSC to the referrer’s ID
- 20 VRSC to the referrer’s referrer’s ID
- 20 VRSC to the referrer’s referrer’s referrer’s ID
- 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined

100% of all funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.

## To create an identity:

Create your commitment with the following command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registernamecommitment Name youraddressorid referrerfriendlyname@
That will respond with something like:
{
  "txid": "377576f8ada1acc2aeb013ddf7a9ad86756cb990d4c5fc70b5a9a0fca43d727e",
  "namereservation": {
    "name": "Name",
    "salt": "7b981f0a1ff2593167ef078150d0116335a7f329f9403b0abaeca30a42d8876a",
    "referral": "iSJLKp1hvn51Zg2Y6FBKjzLs9AAy7fomWN",
    "parent": "",
    "nameid": "iDXx9FPrAS5k2XCGss6FFmDQQMsts63uUg"
  }
}
```
You then wait for the commitment to be mined into a block, then use the information returned above as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registeridentity '{"txid":"377576f8ada1acc2aeb013ddf7a9ad86756cb990d4c5fc70b5a9a0fca43d727e", "namereservation": {
    "name": "Name", "salt": "7b981f0a1ff2593167ef078150d0116335a7f329f9403b0abaeca30a42d8876a", "referral":"referrerfriendlyname@"}, "identity":{"name":"Name", "primaryaddresses":["RKo5u8N1sStZu81fU8kaxhoDcFcJmNEwSp"], "minimumsignatures":1, "privateaddress":"zs14y0aa096em2as6n4fauyumqeywz45rfpze38c39fksgtjsac9vmms7fmstcylpaalm7rseu8838"}}'
```
As long as you have enough funds and you are registering a new identity on the blockchain, you will be able to use your new identity in place of an address as soon as the transaction created by the registration command is mined into the blockchain.
You may list the identities in your wallet with the command `listidentities`, and you may display specific identities with the command `getidentity`. If you have the authority, or use identities under your control as revocation or recovery authorities for other identities, you may also revoke and recovery identities as well.

If you’ve been around crypto for even a little while, you’ll start to hear things like “not your keys, not your coins”, “lose your keys, lose your coins”. If you lose your keys, no one will ever be able to recover your money.

In fact, trading off decentralized, censorship resistant public systems for this risk to your cryptocurrency assets is such a fundamental issue in blockchain systems today that it is considered an acceptable price for having the benefit of full control over your own funds and blockchain assets.

Verus ID provides an elegant solution to these previously unsolved, fundamental problems, and also provides quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities that provide the following advantages over today’s blockchain systems:

1. Identity and currency address are one and the same. Your friendly name can be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer.
2. Each identity must have a set of addresses (1 or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. Each identity also refers to two additional identities that have authority over:
    - **Primary** - this is the self identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.
    - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.
    - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.
3. Identities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party’s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.
4. If an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using “z_getbalance identity@”.
5. If later, a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure s added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well. That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.

## Making a new identity
Arguably, the hardest part of the new Verus identity technology is just making your first identity, especially without a GUI. Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ ‘[{“address”:”alice@”, “amount”:100}]’
```
or
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100
```
Making a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. To prevent this name “front running”, you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.

Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows:


- 20 VRSC to the referrer’s ID
- 20 VRSC to the referrer’s referrer’s ID
- 20 VRSC to the referrer’s referrer’s referrer’s ID
- 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined

100% of all funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.

## To create an identity:

Create your commitment with the following command:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registernamecommitment Name youraddressorid referrerfriendlyname@
That will respond with something like:
{
  "txid": "377576f8ada1acc2aeb013ddf7a9ad86756cb990d4c5fc70b5a9a0fca43d727e",
  "namereservation": {
    "name": "Name",
    "salt": "7b981f0a1ff2593167ef078150d0116335a7f329f9403b0abaeca30a42d8876a",
    "referral": "iSJLKp1hvn51Zg2Y6FBKjzLs9AAy7fomWN",
    "parent": "",
    "nameid": "iDXx9FPrAS5k2XCGss6FFmDQQMsts63uUg"
  }
}
```
You then wait for the commitment to be mined into a block, then use the information returned above as follows:
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registeridentity '{"txid":"377576f8ada1acc2aeb013ddf7a9ad86756cb990d4c5fc70b5a9a0fca43d727e", "namereservation": {
    "name": "Name", "salt": "7b981f0a1ff2593167ef078150d0116335a7f329f9403b0abaeca30a42d8876a", "referral":"referrerfriendlyname@"}, "identity":{"name":"Name", "primaryaddresses":["RKo5u8N1sStZu81fU8kaxhoDcFcJmNEwSp"], "minimumsignatures":1, "privateaddress":"zs14y0aa096em2as6n4fauyumqeywz45rfpze38c39fksgtjsac9vmms7fmstcylpaalm7rseu8838"}}'
```
As long as you have enough funds and you are registering a new identity on the blockchain, you will be able to use your new identity in place of an address as soon as the transaction created by the registration command is mined into the blockchain.
You may list the identities in your wallet with the command `listidentities`, and you may display specific identities with the command `getidentity`. If you have the authority, or use identities under your control as revocation or recovery authorities for other identities, you may also revoke and recovery identities as well.

# Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and Verus Reserve cross-chain currency conversion technology -- Technology Preview

The Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. Sending currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies is as easy as sending a cryptocurrency in less advanced systems today, except that the new Verus protocol enables you to include another blockchain as part of your destination and convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price along the way. All conversions are fully decentralized, require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network, and calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.

With no costs beyond public blockchain network fees, Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization of any size to make a fractional reserve currency of its own on an independent, uncluttered blockchain with cross-chain interoperability, and immediately useful for payments and conversion to other currencies from within the Verus wallet. 100% of the 0.01% fees for such conversions go directly to the miners and stakers of the organization's new chain, and those miners and stakers also have the option of merge mining up to 14 other blockchains and coins while mining their own project, improving efficiency, profitability, and shared liquidity for everyone involved. Each blockchain is independent and connected through the Verus Reserve protocol
.
**Launching the testnet:**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST
```

# Chain definition:

- Maximum of 3 eras
- Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations.
- Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.
VRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.

**Sample chain definition:**
```
./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{"name":"RESERVEWITHPREMINE","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM","premine":50000000000000,"initialcontribution":5000000000000,"conversion":100000000,"minpreconvert":45000000000000,"maxpreconvert":100000000000000,"launchfee":0,"billingperiod":14400,"notarizationreward":100000000000,"eras":[{"reward":5000000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0,"eraoptions":1}],"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"ipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"},
{"networkaddress":"2ndipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"}]}'
```

The example above defines a chain that emits a premine to the indicated address and also converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.

The initial price in reserve at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the early blocks that will come in as reserve currency. All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve. A currency with a reserve of 0.1 or 10% will rise or fall fairly quickly when converted to or from, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit.

**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:**
```
./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN
```
On first connection, a local config file is created, and  VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.

The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.


## Here are a few examples of cross-chain operations using the command line:

**Participating in a blockchain launch and converting from reserve before the chain has started (refund address is optional and will default to paymentaddress):**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{"name": "RESERVEWITHPREMINE", "paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "refundaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "preconvert": 1}'
```

**Sending unconverted VRSCTEST to an address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain for later conversion to/from the native coin.**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{"name": "RESERVEWITHPREMINE", "paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "refundaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000}'
```

**Sending reserve to another chain and converting a coin from reserve to that chain's native currency at the current market price.**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{"name": "RESERVEWITHPREMINE", "paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "refundaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "tonative": 1}'
```

**Sending reserve currency to an address on the current PBaaS reserve chain with no cross-chain operation, Reserve currency on a PBaaS chain is equivalent to and convertible between the native VRSCTEST currency, but may also be sent to and used on PBaaS reserve chains. It will arrive as reserve currency.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{"paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000}'
```

**Sending native currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting it to reserve currency at the same time at the current market price.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{"paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "toreserve": 1}'
```

**Sending reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting it to native currency at the same time at the current price. It will arrive as native currency.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{"paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "tonative": 1}'
```

**Getting the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate
```
**... a specific block.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum
```
**... a range with a specific period between**.
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep
```
**Refunding contributions made to a failed PbaaS chain launch**.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME
```

# Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and Verus Reserve cross-chain currency conversion technology -- Technology Preview

The Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. Sending currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies is as easy as sending a cryptocurrency in less advanced systems today, except that the new Verus protocol enables you to include another blockchain as part of your destination and convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price along the way. All conversions are fully decentralized, require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network, and calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.

With no costs beyond public blockchain network fees, Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization of any size to make a fractional reserve currency of its own on an independent, uncluttered blockchain with cross-chain interoperability, and immediately useful for payments and conversion to other currencies from within the Verus wallet. 100% of the 0.01% fees for such conversions go directly to the miners and stakers of the organization's new chain, and those miners and stakers also have the option of merge mining up to 14 other blockchains and coins while mining their own project, improving efficiency, profitability, and shared liquidity for everyone involved. Each blockchain is independent and connected through the Verus Reserve protocol
.
**Launching the testnet:**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST
```

# Chain definition:

- Maximum of 3 eras
- Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations.
- Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.
VRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.

**Sample chain definition:**
```
./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{"name":"RESERVEWITHPREMINE","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM","premine":50000000000000,"initialcontribution":5000000000000,"conversion":100000000,"minpreconvert":45000000000000,"maxpreconvert":100000000000000,"launchfee":0,"billingperiod":14400,"notarizationreward":100000000000,"eras":[{"reward":5000000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0,"eraoptions":1}],"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"ipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"},
{"networkaddress":"2ndipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"}]}'
```

The example above defines a chain that emits a premine to the indicated address and also converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.

The initial price in reserve at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the early blocks that will come in as reserve currency. All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve. A currency with a reserve of 0.1 or 10% will rise or fall fairly quickly when converted to or from, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit.

**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:**
```
./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN
```
On first connection, a local config file is created, and  VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.

The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.


## Here are a few examples of cross-chain operations using the command line:

**Participating in a blockchain launch and converting from reserve before the chain has started (refund address is optional and will default to paymentaddress):**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{"name": "RESERVEWITHPREMINE", "paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "refundaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "preconvert": 1}'
```

**Sending unconverted VRSCTEST to an address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain for later conversion to/from the native coin.**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{"name": "RESERVEWITHPREMINE", "paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "refundaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000}'
```

**Sending reserve to another chain and converting a coin from reserve to that chain's native currency at the current market price.**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{"name": "RESERVEWITHPREMINE", "paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "refundaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "tonative": 1}'
```

**Sending reserve currency to an address on the current PBaaS reserve chain with no cross-chain operation, Reserve currency on a PBaaS chain is equivalent to and convertible between the native VRSCTEST currency, but may also be sent to and used on PBaaS reserve chains. It will arrive as reserve currency.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{"paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000}'
```

**Sending native currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting it to reserve currency at the same time at the current market price.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{"paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "toreserve": 1}'
```

**Sending reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting it to native currency at the same time at the current price. It will arrive as native currency.**

# IMPORTANT SECURITY/PRIVACY UPDATE
This update incorporates a fix for the Zcash protocol issue described in: https://z.cash/support/security/announcements/security-announcement-2019-09-24/

In addition, this version also includes updates to Sapling functionality, including the Sprout to Sapling migration APIs added to the Zcash protocol up to and including version 2.0.7-3 of Zcash. The issue fixed by this update does not expose any funds to theft or counterfeit, but it does fix a vulnerability that an attacker may exploit to probe for information regarding a specific node's control over private keys. Since the issue resolved does not put funds directly at risk, this update is considered CRITICAL, not mandatory. We recommended that all users upgrade to this version of the Verus CLI or GUI wallet immediately and discontinue use of previous wallets.


# Notable Changes
- Integrated Zcash updates from Sapling release to 2.0.7-3
- Added Sprout to Sapling upgrade API
- Including support for PBaaS multi-chain test network with permissionless blockchain launches, reserve currency conversion protocols, merge mining, and easy cross-chain transactions.

# Testnet Reset
The testnet will be deleted and relaunched for this release. **IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY LAUNCHED VRSCTEST, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**

This release includes the ability to connect to and use the Verus Testnet with easy multi-chain network, cross-chain send, and in-wallet currency conversion capabilities that go beyond any blockchain system or cryptocurrency available today. Don't take our word for it. Just give it a try when you're not using the other mainstream wallet features

Try out cross-chain sends, create and exchange your own reserve currencies and merge mine up to 15 chains at once on the VerusCoin testnet!

# Notable Changes
- Added Testnet support for Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and Verus Reserve cross-chain currency conversion technology

# Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and Verus Reserve cross-chain currency conversion technology -- Technology Preview

The Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. Sending currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies is as easy as sending a cryptocurrency in less advanced systems today, except that the new Verus protocol enables you to include another blockchain as part of your destination and convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price along the way. All conversions are fully decentralized, require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network, and calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.

With no costs beyond public blockchain network fees, Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization of any size to make a fractional reserve currency of its own on an independent, uncluttered blockchain with cross-chain interoperability, and immediately useful for payments and conversion to other currencies from within the Verus wallet. 100% of the 0.01% fees for such conversions go directly to the miners and stakers of the organization's new chain, and those miners and stakers also have the option of merge mining up to 14 other blockchains and coins while mining their own project, improving efficiency, profitability, and shared liquidity for everyone involved. Each blockchain is independent and connected through the Verus Reserve protocol
.
**Launching the testnet:**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST
```

# Chain definition:

- Maximum of 3 eras
- Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations.
- Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.
VRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.

**Sample chain definition:**
```
./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{"name":"RESERVEWITHPREMINE","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM","premine":50000000000000,"initialcontribution":5000000000000,"conversion":100000000,"minpreconvert":45000000000000,"maxpreconvert":100000000000000,"launchfee":0,"billingperiod":14400,"notarizationreward":100000000000,"eras":[{"reward":5000000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0,"eraoptions":1}],"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"ipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"},
{"networkaddress":"2ndipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"}]}'
```

The example above defines a chain that emits a premine to the indicated address and also converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.

The initial price in reserve at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the early blocks that will come in as reserve currency. All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve. A currency with a reserve of 0.1 or 10% will rise or fall fairly quickly when converted to or from, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit.

**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:**
```
./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN
```
On first connection, a local config file is created, and  VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.

The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.


## Here are a few examples of cross-chain operations using the command line:

**Participating in a blockchain launch and converting from reserve before the chain has started (refund address is optional and will default to paymentaddress):**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{"name": "RESERVEWITHPREMINE", "paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "refundaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "preconvert": 1}'
```

**Sending unconverted VRSCTEST to an address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain for later conversion to/from the native coin.**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{"name": "RESERVEWITHPREMINE", "paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "refundaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000}'
```

**Sending reserve to another chain and converting a coin from reserve to that chain's native currency at the current market price.**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{"name": "RESERVEWITHPREMINE", "paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "refundaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "tonative": 1}'
```

**Sending reserve currency to an address on the current PBaaS reserve chain with no cross-chain operation, Reserve currency on a PBaaS chain is equivalent to and convertible between the native VRSCTEST currency, but may also be sent to and used on PBaaS reserve chains. It will arrive as reserve currency.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{"paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000}'
```

**Sending native currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting it to reserve currency at the same time at the current market price.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{"paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "toreserve": 1}'
```

**Sending reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting it to native currency at the same time at the current price. It will arrive as native currency.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{"paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "tonative": 1}'
```

**Getting the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block.**
```

```
**... a specific block.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum

# Notable Changes
- Fixed daemon output export error message on VRSCTEST
- Fixed fees bouncing back from a reserve send to Verus and allow exports to continue if done incorrectly
- Include currency state in chain definitions for both getchaindefinition and getdefinedchains

# Chain definition:

- Maximum of 3 eras
- Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations.
- Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.
VRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.

**Sample chain definition:**
```
./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{"name":"RESERVEWITHPREMINE","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM","premine":50000000000000,"initialcontribution":5000000000000,"conversion":100000000,"minpreconvert":45000000000000,"maxpreconvert":100000000000000,"launchfee":0,"billingperiod":14400,"notarizationreward":100000000000,"eras":[{"reward":5000000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0,"eraoptions":1}],"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"ipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"},

```

The example above defines a chain that emits a premine to the indicated address and also converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be.

A currency with a reserve of 0.1 or 10% will rise or fall fairly quickly when converted to or from, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit.

**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:**
```
./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN

On first connection, a local config file is created, and  VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.

The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.


## Here are a few examples of cross-chain operations using the command line:

**Participating in a blockchain launch and converting from reserve before the chain has started (refund address is optional and will default to paymentaddress):**
```

# Notable Changes
- Added command `refundfailedlaunch` to refund all contributions made to PBaaS chain to VRSCTEST after a failed chain start block.

- Fixed wallet scan issue that could prevent a wallet from recognizing reserve coins sent to it on a PBaaS chain. If you have such a wallet, a rescan with the new update should make your coins appear.

# Chain definition:

- Maximum of 3 eras
- Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations.
- Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.
VRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.

**Sample chain definition:**
```
./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{"name":"RESERVEWITHPREMINE","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM","premine":50000000000000,"initialcontribution":5000000000000,"conversion":100000000,"minpreconvert":45000000000000,"maxpreconvert":100000000000000,"launchfee":0,"billingperiod":14400,"notarizationreward":100000000000,"eras":[{"reward":5000000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0,"eraoptions":1}],"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"ipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"},
{"networkaddress":"2ndipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"}]}'
```

The example above defines a chain that emits a premine to the indicated address and also converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.

The initial price in reserve at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the early blocks that will come in as reserve currency. All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve. A currency with a reserve of 0.1 or 10% will rise or fall fairly quickly when converted to or from, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit.

**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:**
```
./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN
```
On first connection, a local config file is created, and  VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.

The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.


## Here are a few examples of cross-chain operations using the command line:

**Participating in a blockchain launch and converting from reserve before the chain has started (refund address is optional and will default to paymentaddress):**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{"name": "RESERVEWITHPREMINE", "paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "refundaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "preconvert": 1}'
```

**Sending unconverted VRSCTEST to an address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain for later conversion to/from the native coin.**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{"name": "RESERVEWITHPREMINE", "paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "refundaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000}'
```

**Sending reserve to another chain and converting a coin from reserve to that chain's native currency at the current market price.**
```
./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{"name": "RESERVEWITHPREMINE", "paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "refundaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "tonative": 1}'
```

**Sending reserve currency to an address on the current PBaaS reserve chain with no cross-chain operation, Reserve currency on a PBaaS chain is equivalent to and convertible between the native VRSCTEST currency, but may also be sent to and used on PBaaS reserve chains. It will arrive as reserve currency.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{"paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000}'
```

**Sending native currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting it to reserve currency at the same time at the current market price.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{"paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "toreserve": 1}'
```

**Sending reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting it to native currency at the same time at the current price. It will arrive as native currency.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{"paymentaddress": "R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM", "amount":5000, "tonative": 1}'
```

**Getting the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate
```
**... a specific block.**
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum
```
**... a range with a specific period between**.
```
./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep
```
**Refunding contributions made to a failed PbaaS chain launch**.
```
verus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME
```

Please note that this is a test release intended to use for testing and development with public blockchains as a service (PBaaS). THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED FOR USE ON MAINNET.

Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. Sending currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies is as easy as sending a cryptocurrency in less advanced systems today, except that the new Verus protocol enables you to include another blockchain as part of your destination and convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price along the way. All conversions are fully decentralized, require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network, and calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.

Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization of any size to make a currency with its own blockchain, support it in world class wallets, develop its own applications, and use it for payments worldwide that can be converted to the reserve currency without ever having to leave the blockchain network. Each blockchain is independent and connected through the Verus Reserve protocol.

**Sample chain definition**:
```
./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{"name":"RESERVEWITHPREMINE","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM","premine":50000000000000,"initialcontribution":5000000000000,"conversion":100000000,"minpreconvert":45000000000000,"maxpreconvert":100000000000000,"launchfee":0,"billingperiod":14400,"notarizationreward":100000000000,"eras":[{"reward":5000000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0,"eraoptions":1}],"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"ipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"},

# IMPORTANT: CRITICAL UPDATE -- UPGRADE IMMEDIATELY

****COMBINATION SECURITY FIX AND INITIAL PBaaS PREPARATION****

During an audit, a potential security issue was recently identified and fixed. This version both fixes the security issue in question immediately, and also uses this as an opportunity to include some early PBaaS functionality that while not fully enabled, will allow us to test future PBaaS functionality on the main Verus chain in the near future. There is no activation date for these fixes. They are important and immediate. There has been no exploitation of this issue yet, and to our knowledge, details are not known outside of core developers. We recommend immediate upgrade of all Verus wallets.

Increased number of outbound connections from 4 to 5.
Fixed CLI bug displaying 0 mega hashes done when it was hashing just fine.
Fixed zfunds calculation on coinsupply RPC
Fixed bug preventing Mac builds from mining with the enhancements introduced in v0.5.3


Linux and Windows only release, MacOS on the way, Mac users should remain on version 5.1
To upgrade your wallet, run the agama-upgrade script included and enter the directory of your Verus Enhanced Agama app
Fixed one not fully portable call in the portable code
# IMPORTANT

****THIS IS A MANDATORY UPDATE, AND IF YOU DO NOT UPDATE, YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE MAIN VERUS CHAIN AFTER BLOCK 310000.****
# VerusHash 2.0

New **VerusHash 2.0**, designed to close the performance gap between CPU, GPU, and FPGA.

# Verus Agama Improvements

Full support of any Komodo asset running natively alongside Verus Coin. This is done by separating out the daemon for Komodo, allowing both the Verus daemon and the Komodo daemon to run simultaneously.

https://medium.com/veruscoin/veruscoin-0-5-0-official-release-notes-6d371095dc7a
v0.4.0h fixes address indexes for the insight explorer and some APIs, as well as a rare segfault in network reorg edge cases from the cheatcatcher.
Version 0.4.0g includes all improvements in 0.4.0f and an expiry on stake transactions to allow deletion from wallets later
Version 0.4.0f includes all improvements in 0.4.0e.
In addition, it provides more detail about stake (winner of the contest) and mint (staked reward) transactions in Agama GUI as well as CLI listtransactions. It also introduces safeguards against any possibility of double staking behavior caused by forks and reorgs and the ability to set the maximum number of transparent and private transactions in Agama in settings->App config.
0.4.0e fixes issues and introduces a much cleaner view of staking transactions and minted coinbases in the Agama GUI. The following community reported issues are resolved:
1. Coinbase shielding problems to Sapling and sometimes to Sprout private addresses are resolved
2. Staking will again default to sending the coinbase to the address that staked the reward unless **-pubkey=66charpubkey** is set. The public key of an address where you would like the coinbases to go can be determined using **"validateaddress"** either in the CLI or GUI.
3. Agama GUI no longer shows ins and outs or multiple lines for a staking transaction. Instead, it now displays an easy to understand single line for each "stake" transaction and also easily distinguishes between mined and minted coinbases once they are mature.
## 0.4.0c - released 10/29/2018

- All versions of the Verus Coin wallet from **0.4.0** and later have support for **Sapling high performance zero knowledge transactions**, which will activate on the Verus Coin Network at block **227520**. In addition to basic Sapling support, 0.4.0c includes support for Sapling compatible, transparent mobile transactions. **For lite mode usage on the Verus Coin or Zcash networks, you will need Verus Enhanced Agama v 0.4.0c.**

- In addition to Sapling and support for Stake Guard transactions, which all versions **0.4.0** or later have, 0.4.0c also includes a powerful *“Cheat Catcher”* that can earn money as miners and stakers who use it protect the Verus Coin network by catching stakers who are staking for rewards in a selfish way that does not contribute to converging the network on one blockchain. **The new “Cheat Catcher” support requires a Sapling z-address, either passed in to the CLI wallet with the “-cheatcatcher=zaddress” option, or added in the Settings->App config of the enhanced Agama GUI.**

- Once your cheat catcher address has been set, a **full node wallet that is mining OR staking, will also be looking for forks where the same winning coins may be posted on two different forks, signed by the same person.** If this is ever discovered, the the mining or staking wallet will create a transaction that has cryptographic evidence of the cheating and submit it for shielding to the cheat catcher’s address. That means that while staking or mining, anyone who has a Sapling cheat catcher address set, may periodically find an additional shielded coinbase or two in their cheat catching address. **Earning cheat catching rewards does not new create coins, but actually takes them from cheaters, so DON’T CHEAT :) !** Earning a cheat catching reward can also occur whether or not you earn a block reward and is available equally across the network to all miners and stakers, more dependent on who happens to observe the cheating fork and catches the cheater than on staking or mining power.

## Version 0.4.0c also fixes the following issues reported in prior versions:
- Wallet balance can get out of sync with blockchain when staking
- Some non-Latin usernames cause failure to load
- When used to load KMD in GUI Agama, Komodo stops accruing interest after transfer
### IF YOUR WALLET IS OUT OF SYNC, YOU CAN RESCAN TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

## For CLI:
- Simply add the parameter **“-rescan”** when starting the daemon.
## For GUI:
- Close the application, wait for the GUI to close, then restart the GUI
- When restarting, select **“Activate Coin”**, not a dropdown shortcut
on the “Activate Coin” screen, select **“Verus”** and select **“Native mode”**
- Choose the **“daemon param: rescan”** option
click **“Activate Coin”**
## Fixes:
- Solves an issue where pool may exceed getblocktemplate's ability to keep up with work queue when network is under stress
- Fix to verus bash script to allow execution from external directories
## Fixed:
- Komodo compatibility





## Verus Coin 0.4.0 - Release Notes
# IMPORTANT
IF TWO OF YOUR MACHINES STAKE BLOCKS WITH THE SAME COINS, EACH ON A SEPARATE FORK, YOU CAN NOW LOSE YOUR BLOCK REWARD TO A CHEAT-CATCHER.

STAKING IS NOW OFF BY DEFAULT TO PREVENT MULTI-MACHINE STAKING OF THE SAME COINS OR ADDRESSES. YOU CAN EASILY ENABLE STAKING WITH THE “-mint” PARAMETER TO verusd, “setgenerate true 0” WITH “verus” CLI, OR THE STAKING BUTTON IN THE GUI.

ONLY STAKE ANY ADDRESS OR WALLET ON ONE COMPUTER AT A TIME, NOT MORE, UNLESS YOU CAN BE ABSOLUTELY SURE THEY ARE IN SYNC AND ON THE SAME CHAIN AT EVERY BLOCK. YOU CAN STILL MINE ON AS MANY MACHINES AS YOU’D LIKE.

### Sapling
Verus Coin 0.4.0 includes support for Sapling addresses and transactions, including memory usage reduction of near 98% and performance improvements over previous z-transactions typically 40-50x. As with Zcash Sapling upgrade rules, older “Sprout” addresses and “Sapling” addresses may not be mixed in the same transaction. That means if you have Verus Coin that you would like to move from an older Sprout z-address to a Sapling z-address, you must first send it to a transparent address, then to the Sapling z-address. Sapling addresses can be used for shielding coinbase transactions or other functions. Retrieving viewing keys for Sapling addresses, which is not required for normal transactions, is not yet supported, and will be included in the next Sapling technology update.

### Crypto-conditions and StakeGuard
Verus-enhanced, Komodo crypto-condition technology, enabling smart transactions and new types of on-chain functionalities. Verus has enhanced the original crypto-condition technology to make integration with standard transactions easier and enable things like StakeGuard, the Verus nothing-at-stake solution. In later releases, the same technology will enable PBaaS, voting, identity capabilities, and more.

### Cheat Catcher
In addition to Stake Guard, which supports the nothing at stake solution, this version of Verus includes an early, functional version of the Cheat Catcher, a system that enables every miner or staker to catch stake cheating, when someone stakes two blocks with the same coins on two or more forks. With this version, all known orphaned stake transactions are compared to successful stakes when they mature, and if the orphan was trying to stake the exact same coins but on a different fork and the real fork at the same time, the miner of the block that is 100 blocks later, when that coinbase matures, will mine or stake a spend transaction for that cheat into the block, and send it to a sapling address the miner or staker has set in their wallet. If your wallet catches and spends a cheat transaction the reward for that coinbase will be automatically shielded to your address at the same time as you win the block. The early Cheat Catcher does not broadcast cheating transactions, and it will not catch all possible cheats on the network. It will make it a statistically losing proposition to cheat. This means you should not stake the same addresses on more than one computer at a time. Doing so creates the possibility that you will stake on two forks with the same coins, which puts your earnings at risk. Future cheat catcher implementations will excel at catching cheats on the network.

### Stake Delegation
In the new Verus network protocol that activates at the same time as Sapling, you can now set the parameter -pubkey in the command line wallet, which will redirect both mining AND staking rewards to the public key of an address, which can be obtained from an address with the “validatekey” command.


- Timing improvements for more efficient staking
- Improved support for synchronizing with non-VRSC KMD-family coins
- Non-mandatory

This release should make a huge difference in global network synchronization, mining, and staking, which should provide a strong foundation as the network grows. In addition, it has significant efficiency improvements for both mining and staking. Here is a rundown of the improvements in this version:
New in both command line and GUI:
1. Reconfigured connection ratios, better seed node discovery built in. Default outgoing connections now 4, default incoming for full node 384. If your machine can handle it, you can help the network and broadcast your stakes more quickly to increase the number of connections in your VRSC.conf with "maxconnections=n", where n is the number you wish to use.
2. Improved lag detection. If your wallet detects a lag, it immediately stops attempting to mine or stake and devotes maximum resources to catching up. Rather than continuing to mine or stake, which may contribute to further lag, this action ensures mining and staking occurs on a viable tip of the chain.
3. Improved staking efficiency. This version raises the default priority of the staking thread, ensuring that the staking process is fast and efficient, even in cases where it would have also lagged with mining or other machine load.
4. All updates and improvements from Komodo Platform as of 1.5 weeks ago have been merged.
Preparing for unlocked era.
First release with verus-cli
Linux, Mac and Windows variants built and distributed for the VerusCoin Launch.
