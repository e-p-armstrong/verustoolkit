# Remarks on Windows command line formatting:

The CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS. On the native windows command prompt (`cmd.com`) the formatting is different.

 * For windows substitute the shown `'`-character with the `"`-character.
 * For windows substitute the shown `"`-character with the `\"`-characters.

Note: this only applies to giving commands from the windows command prompt. Verus Desktop will accept commands as listed.
