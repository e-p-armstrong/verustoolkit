            "Verus is a blockchain forked from Komodo, which is considered the world's most secure privacy blockchain. As a result, Verus inherits many of Komodo's security features, including dPoW (a form of Proof of Work that \"backs up\" the blockchain to the most secure blockchain in the world, currently Bitcoin) and zk-SNARK privacy, which is a high level of privacy built into its blockchain.\n\nVerus is unique in its use of VerusHash, the fastest cryptographic hash algorithm in the world, which makes it CPU mineable. This means that Verus can be mined on x64 CPUs, leveling the playing field with GPUs.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of Verus is its 50/50 split between PoW (Proof of Work) and PoS (Proof of Stake). This hybrid consensus algorithm allows for both mining and staking to occur, with half of the blocks being mined and the other half being staked. This approach provides an additional layer of security and decentralization to the network.\n\nIn summary, Verus is a secure, mineable, and decentralized cryptocurrency that utilizes its unique features, such as VerusHash, dPoW, zk-SNARK privacy, and a 50/50 split between PoW and PoS, to provide a robust and secure blockchain ecosystem.",

The Verus coin, VRSC, is a CPU Mineable coin which utilizes VerusHash, the fastest cryptographic hash algorithm in the world. It can be mined on x64 CPUs which has significantly leveled the playing field with GPUs.\nBecause Verus is a fork of Komodo, it comes with the same first in class security features, such as dPoW\u2026a form of Proof of Work that essentially \u201cbacks up\u201d the blockchain to the most secure blockchain in the world, presently Bitcoin. However, chains forked from Komodo can notarize to Komodo\u2019s blockchain. This allows them double the protection against attacks while giving them the effect of instant security, as if they were as mature as the blockchains they are backing up to (notarizing to).\nAlso a part of the package with Komodo comes zk-SNARK privacy. Komodo was a fork from ZCash and has the same level of privacy built into its blockchain. You can learn more about zk-SNARK and zCash here.\nUnlike Komodo, Verus implements a combination of PoW and PoS (Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, respectively). This is a 50/50 split in which half the blocks are mined by mining and the other half by staking. Mining and Staking is done using a modified version",
