            "How does Verus's cross-chain protocol, Verus VIP, ensure the security and integrity of cross-chain transactions, and what measures are in place to prevent malicious attacks from colluding notaries or stolen notary private keys?",
            "Verus VIP is a cross-chain protocol that ensures the security and integrity of cross-chain transactions through a unique consensus mechanism. Unlike common cross-chain protocols, Verus VIP does not rely on a single entity or identity holding custody over funds, making it more secure and resistant to malicious attacks.\n\nThe protocol works as follows:\n\n1. **Initial Notarization**: A validator, either a proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) validator, enters a notarization.\n2. **Second Validator Agreement**: Another validator, alternating between PoW and PoS, must agree to the notarization.\n3. **Notary Witness Signatures**: Only after the two validators agree, notary witnesses can apply their signatures to confirm the notarization candidate.\n\nThis mechanism ensures that notarizations are validated by multiple entities, making it more secure and resistant to malicious attacks.\n\nHowever, even with this mechanism in place, there is still a risk of malicious attacks if a majority of notaries are colluding or if their private keys are stolen. To mitigate this risk, Verus VIP has additional measures in place:\n\n1. **Honest Notary Majority**: If a majority of notaries are honest and operate according to the protocol, the security of the protocol is sufficient to prevent malicious attacks.\n2. **Mitigation Measures**: Verus VIP provides ways to respond to malicious notary attacks without risking loss of funds, even if a majority of notaries are colluding or their keys are stolen.\n\nTo successfully attack a PBaaS cross-chain connection, malicious notaries would need to collude and possess fake validators with more power than the honest validators. However, Verus VIP's design makes it difficult for malicious actors to succeed in such an attack.\n\nIn summary, Verus VIP's cross-chain protocol ensures the security and integrity of cross-chain transactions through a combination of validator agreements, notary witness signatures, and additional measures to prevent malicious attacks from colluding notaries or stolen notary private keys.",
            "rowing, actual chain with both proof of work and proof of stake with an eventual winner. NC still has the miners and stakers create and earn from earned notarizations, but it also must have agreement from specified notaries to finalize any notarization and cannot finalize cross-chain proof roots without that agreement.\nImprovement over common cross-chain protocols\nSince Verus VIP does not ever have any identity, multisig or otherwise, hold custody over any funds when crossing from one decentralized network to another, even in the context of the Verus Ethereum contracts, threats caused by malicious notaries or stolen keys to drain funds on decentralized bridges or currencies are simply not viable against the Verus VIP protocol.\nCross-chain notarizations must first be entered by an earning validator, either PoW or PoS, and must also be agreed to by another validator, alternating between work and stake in eligibility. Only after that happens can notary witnesses apply their signature and agree to make that a confirmed notarization candidate. Still, what happens if a majority of notaries are malicious and colluding, or if some entity was able to somehow steal a majority of the notary private keys?\nIf the majority of notary witnesses are honest and operate their witnessing nodes according to the protocol, the security of such a model should be sufficient for any level of cross-chain transaction proof. If, however, a majority of the notaries were colluding and malicious or if their keys were stolen, Verus VIP still provides ways to ensure that the protocol responds to such a situation without risk of loss. Although there are ways to mitigate such a form of attack, even if no mitigation were available, such malicious or fraudulent notary witnesses would need the following in order to attack a PBaaS cross-chain connection:\nColluding, malicious notaries\nFake validators with mo",
