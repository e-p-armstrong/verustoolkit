            "What are VerusIDs, and how do they work in terms of authorities and fund protection?",
            "VerusIDs are a powerful feature of the Verus ecosystem that can be used to send and receive funds, and also serve as fully self-sovereign identities. They are similar to email addresses, but with more functionality and security. A VerusID can be any combination of letters and numbers, as long as it ends with an '@' symbol.\n\nEach VerusID is controlled by one or more associated addresses, which means that if you send funds to an ID, they will be available to be spent by that ID and also by the associated addresses. This design allows for a lot of flexibility and customization.\n\nA key aspect of VerusIDs is the concept of authorities. Each ID has three authorities: primary authority, revocation authority, and recovery authority.\n\nThe primary authority allows an ID to perform various actions, such as:\n\n* Receive deposits\n* Spend funds\n* Sign\n* Stake\n* Modify ID information\n* Lock\n* Unlock\n\nThe revocation authority, typically assigned to another ID, has the power to revoke the primary authority. This means that if the revocation authority is used, the ID will no longer be able to spend or receive funds, stake, sign, etc. The revocation authority can only be changed by the ID that has been assigned this authority, not by the original ID.\n\nThe recovery authority can be used to recover a revoked primary authority. This means that if an ID's primary authority is revoked, the recovery authority can be used to restore it.\n\nIn summary, VerusIDs provide a robust and flexible way to manage funds and identities, with built-in security features such as authorities and revocation mechanisms.",
            "can use an address (with public and private keys) to send and receive funds. With Verus, however, you can also create a VerusID and use it to send and receive funds. This article is laser focused on features of the VerusID that you can use to protect your funds but VerusIDs are incredibly powerful and can be used as fully self sovereign identities.\nLike an email or web address, VerusIDs can include any combination of letters and numbers. They just have to end with an \u2018@\u2019 symbol. This document uses example addresses such as, Bob@, and Alice@\u2014 but Mogg@ could also be a VerusID, or BigCompany@, or BurgundySocksfortheHolidays@, or whatever.\nVerusIDs are controlled by one or more associated addresses. For example, if you send funds to an ID, they\u2019ll be available to be spent by that ID and also by associated addresses. As we\u2019ll see, this opens up a lot of design space.\nThe Three Authorities\nEach VerusID is created with three authorities. You can think of an authority as a bundle of specific powers.\nFirst is primary authority. Primary authority allows an ID to:\nreceive deposits,\nspend funds,\nsign,\nstake,\nmodify ID information,\nlock, and\nunlock.\n(We\u2019ll look more closely at those last two \u2014 lock and unlock \u2014 in a bit.)\nSecond is the revocation authority, typically assigned to another ID. The revocation authority revokes the primary authority. When used, it prevents an ID from spending or receiving funds, staking, signing, etc. For example, say you have two IDs, \u201cBob@\u201d and \u201cAlice@.\u201d If you assign Bob@\u2019s revocation authority to Alice@:\nAlice@ will be able to revoke Bob@\u2019s primary authority, making Bob@ unable to spend or receive funds, etc.\nOnly Alice@ will be able to change the revocation authority for Bob@; Bob@ will not be able to change it.\nFinally, there\u2019s the recovery authority. After it\u2019s assigned to an ID, the recovery authority can be used to recover a revoked primary a",
