            "To create a Digital Ocean Droplet for running a Verus node, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Select Ubuntu Image**\nChoose the Ubuntu image for your Droplet. Specifically, select the 16.04.4 x64 version of the Ubuntu Server Image.\n\n**Step 2: Choose Droplet Size**\nSelect a suitable size for your Droplet. For a Verus node, a Standard Droplet with 1GB of RAM, 1vCPU, and 25 GB of disk space is recommended.\n\n**Step 3: Choose a Region**\nSelect a region for your Droplet's data center. For Verus, it's recommended to choose a region close to the Verus nodes, such as Frankfurt, to minimize latency.\n\n**Step 4: Create a Hostname**\nCreate a hostname for your Droplet, which will be used internally. You can also set up tags to organize and manage multiple Droplets.\n\n**Step 5: Create the Droplet**\nClick \"Create\" to create your Droplet.\n\n**Managing Your Droplet**\nAfter creating your Droplet, you'll receive an email with the IP address and root password for accessing your new Droplet. You can also manage your Droplet from the Digital Ocean management screen by clicking on the Droplet and then clicking \"Console\" in the upper right corner. From the management screen, you can view your Droplet's status and access more management options.",
            "Step 2\nAt the next screen click the down arrow under the Ubuntu block and select 16.04.4 x64 to use the Ubuntu 16.04 Server ImageStep 3\nScroll down and under the \u201cChoose a size\u201d section, select the top size under Standard Droplets which includes 1GB of RAM, 1vCPU and 25 GB of disk spaceStep 4\nNext, choose a region for the data-center your droplet will be installed in. For Verus I recommend Frankfurt or a similar region that is close to the Verus nodes. A ping from Frankfurt to a node IP is 40ms when compared to SFO at about 180msStep 5\nNext create a hostname for your new droplet. This will be the hostname to the server itself internally. You can also setup Tags if you plan on having many Droplets down the road and want an easy way to organize and find the one you\u2019re looking to do maintenance on, etc.\nThen simply click Create!Step 6\nTo see and manage your Droplet(s), when you login simply click \u201cDroplets\u201d from the left menu bar under Manage. Your Droplets will show up to the right and you can see a quick status or click on one for more management optionsNow that you\u2019ve created a Droplet, you will receive an email from Digital Ocean containing the IP address and root password for accessing your new droplet. You can also access the Droplet from the Management screen in your Digital Ocean account by clicking the Droplet, then clicking Console in the upper",
