            "What are some potential drawbacks to traditional conversion systems, and how do these drawbacks impact users seeking to convert between different assets?",
            "Traditional conversion systems, such as those used on Ethereum, have several drawbacks that can negatively impact users seeking to convert between different assets.\n\nOne major issue is the high transaction costs associated with these conversions. These costs can come from various sources, including:\n\n1. **Basic network fees**: In the case of Ethereum, these fees are known as \"gas prices\" and are required to process transactions on the network. As the network becomes more crowded, these fees can increase significantly.\n2. **Conversion fees**: These fees are paid to \"yield farmers\" who provide liquidity to the conversion pools. These fees can add up quickly, especially for users who need to convert between multiple assets.\n3. **Predatory activity costs**: Unfortunately, traditional conversion systems can be vulnerable to predatory activity, such as time-bandit attacks and other exploits. These attacks can result in additional costs for users.\n4. **Inefficient serial transaction processing**: Traditional conversion systems often process transactions serially, which can lead to less efficient use of systemic liquidity and higher slippage rates. This can result in unseen costs for users.\n\nThese drawbacks can make it difficult and expensive for users to convert between different assets, which can limit the overall usability and adoption of these systems.",
            " consensus may arise when time-bandit attacks and additional exploits start to look enticing.\nHigh transaction costs \u2014 for users who seek to convert from one asset to another, transaction costs are many and growing, starting with the basic Ethereum gas prices, which are large and growing on the crowded network. Additional costs come from the conversion fees needed to pay the \u201cyield farmers\u201d who stock the liquidity pools. And finally, there is the cost from predatory activity as described above. There are also unseen costs that arise from the less efficient design of serial transaction processing. Parallel transaction processing (described below) allows for more optimal slippage rates and more efficient use of overall systemic liquidity.",
