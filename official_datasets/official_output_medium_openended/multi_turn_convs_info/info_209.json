            "What is the background and vision of the Verus project, and how does its lead developer's experience influence its development?",
            "The Verus project is a non-profit foundation that aims to create a decentralized, rent-free blockchain framework that enables chain interoperability and can scale to meet global demands. The project is led by Mike Toutonghi, a seasoned web veteran with a rich background in developing innovative technologies. Toutonghi's experience includes leading Kernel development on Microsoft 95, founding Microsoft's Java efforts and .Net, and architecting data systems for internet-scale advertising.\n\nToutonghi's vision for Verus is shaped by his understanding of the limitations of existing blockchain technologies. He recognized the need for different blockchain networks to communicate with each other, and the importance of developing more resilient consensus algorithms. To address these challenges, Toutonghi began by adding Custom Consensus (smart contracts) to Bitcoin script, and then modified the core consensus rules to create a more robust and scalable blockchain framework.\n\nToday, Toutonghi works alongside his son, Michael Jr., and a team of leading developers from around the world to push the boundaries of blockchain technology even further. The Verus project is built on the foundation of several existing blockchain platforms, including Komodo, Zcash, BTCD, and Bitcoin, and is currently testing its latest cutting-edge technology on the public Verus testnet.\n\nToutonghi's experience and expertise have been instrumental in shaping the direction and development of the Verus project. His ability to invent solutions, weave across layers, and build bridges has enabled the creation of a blockchain framework that is designed to be highly scalable, secure, and interoperable. The Verus project's focus on decentralized development and community engagement has also attracted a diverse team of developers and contributors who are working together to build a better blockchain infrastructure for the future.",
            "ent non-profit foundation that offers bounties and aids in the decentralized building of technology by the community. It is in rapid development and has already actualized many parts of its vision for a rent-free blockchain framework that provides chain interoperability and can scale to the world.\nThe Intergenerational Wisdom in the Architecture\nWhile many blockchain developers are still cutting their teeth on this technology, the lead developer of Verus has been around for a while. While Mike Toutonghi often shys from the limelight and shuns hype, it is worth telling that he is a seasoned web veteran who led Kernel development on Microsoft 95, and is also one of the founders of Microsoft\u2019s Java efforts and .Net. Much like his days at Microsoft, where he was adding threads to operating systems where there were none, starting platform efforts that are now used by millions, or architecting data systems for Internet scale advertising, he similarly felt needed to help build the world\u2019s future blockchain infrastructure.\nToutonghi saw that chains needed to talk to each other, that consensus algorithms were not resilient enough, and so began by adding Custom Consensus (smart contracts) to Bitcoin script. The development pioneer went on to modify the core consensus rules and now Toutonghi, alongside his son and dozens of leading developers around the world, are pushing the limits even further, mitigating some of the biggest vulnerabilities and innovating solutions by doing what Toutonghi does best \u2014 inventing solutions, weaving across layers, and building bridges.\nToutonghi and his son, Michael Jr., work with dozens of developers around the world building on Verus\nStealth Mode, Disengage\nVerus is an evolution of Komodo, Zcash, BTCD and Bitcoin, and is currently testing its latest cutting edge technology on the public Verus testnet.
