            "How do I set up staking on my Verus wallet and shield my mined or minted coins to prepare them for staking?",
            "To set up staking on your Verus wallet, you need to ensure that your Verus Coin (VRSC) balance is mature and in the form of a UTXO (unspent transaction output). A mature balance is one that has at least 150 block confirmations. If you have a newly mined or minted block, it will mature after 100 block confirmations. Once mature, you need to shield and unshield the coins to convert them into a UTXO.\n\nTo shield your coins, you'll need to generate a new shielded wallet address, also known as a \"zs\" address. To do this, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open Verus Agama and click on the \"Receive\" tab.\n2. Click on \"Get New Address\" and select \"Private Address (Sapling)\".\n3. You'll see a confirmation in the lower right corner that a new address has been generated.\n\nNext, copy the new \"zs\" address by clicking on the three vertical dots next to it and selecting \"Copy Pub Key\". It's a good idea to save this address to a text file for easy access in the future.\n\nOnce you have your shielded address, you can use it to shield and unshield your coins, preparing them for staking. Note that staking can be activated from the same Mining button in Agama, and you'll need to have a mature VRSC balance and Staking enabled on your wallet to participate.\n\nRemember, if your VRSC balance comes from someone else, a pool mining payout, or an exchange purchase, it's already in UTXO format and will begin staking within 150 block confirmations of coming into your wallet, as long as Staking is enabled.",
            "Success! Your Lite mode wallet address is now a part of your wallet.dat file.\nPart 4 \u2014 Earn More VRSC by Staking Verus Coin!\nYou can also participate in Staking using the Native mode of the Verus wallet, activating staking by having a VRSC mature balance and starting Staking from the same Mining button in Agama.\nStaking is a great way to keep earning VRSC on your mined rewards or any VRSC you purchased on an exchange. For a balance in Verus to actively stake on the blockchain, it needs to be \u201cmature\u201d , in the form of a UTXO(s) and have at least 150 block confirmations as such.\nA newly mined or minted (won from staking) block will mature after 100 block confirmations (about 100 min). After reaching maturity, because it came from the coinbase, it needs to first be shielded and unshielded, which results in a UTXO (unspent transaction output).\nIf the VRSC in your wallet balance comes from someone else, is paid out from your pool mining efforts, or is from an exchange buy, it\u2019s already in UTXO format and will begin staking within 150 block confirmations of coming into your wallet (as long as Staking is enabled on the wallet).\nLet\u2019s talk about how to shield coins you mined from solo mining or minted from staking!\nStep 1\nGenerate a new shielded wallet address. This is a 1 time step, once you\u2019ve generated it, you can keep using it for future shielding/unshielding. To create your \u201czs\u201d address, in Verus Agama first click Receive, then click \u201cGet New Address\u201d and select \u201cPrivate Address (Sapling)\u201d. You\u2019ll see a confirmation in the lower right that it generated a new address.Step 2\nNow copy the new \u201czs\u201d address you generated by clicking the 3 vertical dots next to it and selecting \u201ccopy pub key\u201d. For easy access in the future, you may want to save this to a text file.",
