            "How can I launch a new currency with the Verus Protocol, and what are the advantages of building with Verus?",
            "To launch a new currency with the Verus Protocol, you can use the command-line interface to define and create your currency. For example, to get information about a currency called \"MyBrand\" on the testnet, you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency \"MyBrand\"\n```\nHowever, before you can do this, you need to define your currency using the `definecurrency` command.\n\nThe Verus Protocol offers several advantages for building decentralized applications (DApps) and businesses. It allows you to focus on building the application layer, rather than spending time and money on developing and auditing smart contracts. With Verus, you can launch powerful currencies for your brand, business, community, or organization, and take advantage of its fast, cheap, and secure architecture.\n\nThe Verus Protocol provides a set of Layer 1 (L1) primitives that enable you to build your application layer on top of a robust and scalable foundation. This means you can build your DApp or business without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, and instead focus on creating value for your users.\n\nBy joining the Verus community and learning more about the protocol, you can get ahead of the game and start building with Verus today.",
            "\"MyBrand\"\nCommand-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency \"MyBrand\"\nNow you know everything to launch currencies! \ud83d\udc49 The worldwide community is happy to help on Discord!\nStart to Build\nFor all the builders out there, you can start to use the Verus Protocol right now for your Dapps or businesses. Building with Verus is better, faster, cheaper and more secure than anything else out there.\nFocus on building the application layer instead of spending giant amounts of time and money on Solidity developers and smart contract audits.\nLaunch powerful currencies for your brand, business, community and organization now.\nImage showing the L1 primitives of Verus, and how you only need to focus on the application layer when building your Dapp or business!\nJoin the community.
