            "What are the scripts and tasks that need to be done after Verus syncs, and how do they help with staking, wallet backups, and cheat catching?",
            "After Verus syncs, there are several scripts and tasks that can be set up to automate various processes and enhance the staking experience. These scripts and tasks include:\n\n**Script 1: Staking Status Script**\nThis script checks the staking status and sends an alert when a block is mined. The script uses the transaction count of the wallet info to determine when a block has been mined.\n\n**Script 2: Check Verus Script**\nThis script checks the Verus status and sends an alert if there are any issues.\n\n**Script 3: Wallet Backups Script (Optional)**\nThis script creates a backup of the wallet.dat file and sends it to an email address. This is an optional script, but it's recommended to create regular backups of the wallet to prevent loss of funds in case of a disaster.\n\n**Task 1: Setup Crontab for Scripts**\nTo run these scripts automatically, a cron job needs to be set up. This can be done by editing the crontab file using the command `crontab -e`. The scripts can be scheduled to run at specific intervals, such as every 5 minutes, hourly, or daily.\n\n**Task 2: Find Your New Transparent Address**\nTo find your new transparent address, use the command `./verus-cli/verus getaddressesbyaccount \"\"`. This will output your transparent wallet address.\n\n**Task 3: Generate a New zs Sapling Address**\nTo generate a new zs Sapling address, use the command `./verus-cli/verus z_getnewaddress sapling`. This will output a new zs address, which is a shielded address that begins with \"zs\". This address can be used for shielding and unshielding coinbases, as well as for collecting cheats caught by the Cheat Catcher.\n\n**Task 4: Enable Cheat Catcher on Verus Launch w/ Staking**\nTo enable the Cheat Catcher on Verus launch with staking, include the parameter `-cheatcatcher=zsaddr` when launching Verus, where `zsaddr` is your zs address. This will enable the Cheat Catcher to catch any cheats and collect them in your zs address.\n\nThese scripts and tasks can help automate various processes, such as staking, wallet backups, and cheat catching, making it easier to manage your Verus wallet and ensure the security of your funds.",
            "ill initiate, since it looks at tx count of the walletinfo. I\u2019m working on a better way to do this, so you may be alerts that a block is mined when it was you doing a shield or unshield for example.\nScript 3 \u2014 Wallet Backups\nThis script is optional, as mentioned before. For this script, create a file called backup.sh using nano and enter the code below. Be sure to change the file path /home/youruser to your username and of course the reverse IP, username, hostname, and protonmail to yours:\necho \"Attached Backup\" | mail -s \"YourHostName Backup\" -A /home/youruser/.komodo/VRSC/wallet.dat -a \"From: youruser@22.33.44.55.in-addr.arpa\" you@protonmail.com\nScripts to Create and Tasks to Take AFTER Verus Syncs\nAll tasks should be done from within your Home folder and this is where to store all your scripts as well.\nTask 1 \u2014 Setup Crontab for Above Scripts\nThe above scripts can run automatically and alert you, run backups, etc while your sever is mining. You can set your own cronjob schedule, but I\u2019ve put a suggested entry below.\nTo edit cron, issue the command: crontab -e\nThen at the bottom of the file put the following, changing the username to yours:\n*/5 * * * * /home/youruser/stakingstatus.sh\n0 * * * * /home/youruser/checkverus.sh\n0 12 * * * /home/youruser/backup.sh\nTask 2\u2014 Find Your New Transparent Address\n./verus-cli/verus getaddressesbyaccount \"\"\nThis will output your Transparent Wallet address. If you are importing a wallet, disregard.\nTask 3\u2014 Generate a New zs Sapling Address\n./verus-cli/verus z_getnewaddress sapling\nThis will output a new zs Address (Sapling type shielded address which begins with \u201czs\u201d) for use with Shielding and Unshielding your coinbases you mine, and for collecting any Cheats caught by the Cheat Catcher.\nTask 4 \u2014 How to Enable Cheat Catcher on Verus Launch w/ Staking\nYou must include the parameter -cheatcatcher=zsaddr (where zsaddr is your zs addres",
