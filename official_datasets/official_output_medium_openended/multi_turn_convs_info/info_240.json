            "There are several ways to get involved in the Verus community and help amplify important messages about Verus. One way is to join the Verus Twitter Army, which aims to amplify high-quality tweets that need more likes and retweets. To do this, you can join the Verus Discord server and assign yourself the 'Tweet & Share' role in the #welcome channel. This will allow you to receive notifications when there are important tweets that need more engagement.\n\nAnother way to get involved is to stay up-to-date with the latest news and developments in the Verus ecosystem. You can do this by subscribing to the Verus newsletter, which provides a bi-monthly recap of important updates and events.\n\nAdditionally, you can help spread the word about Verus by sharing marketing videos and other content that showcases the benefits and features of the Verus network. By getting involved in these ways, you can help contribute to the growth and success of the Verus community.",
