            "How do I finalize the creation of a blockchain on the Verus platform, including setting up initial nodes and confirming the chain's settings?",
            "To finalize the creation of a blockchain on the Verus platform, you need to complete the last two steps of the chain creation process. \n\n**Step 5: Provide Initial Nodes**\nAfter specifying your chain's settings, you need to provide two public nodes that will run your chain. You can either set up your own nodes or ask the Verus community for help in bootstrapping your chain. For now, this step requires manual input, but it will be automated in the future.\n\n**Step 6: Confirm Chain Settings**\nOnce you have provided the initial nodes, review your chain's settings to ensure everything is correct. If you're ready, press \"confirm\" to proceed. If the chain creation is successful, a green window will pop up, indicating that your chain has been created. If there are any errors, you will receive an error message explaining what went wrong.\n\n**Post-Creation**\nAfter the transaction that created your chain receives one confirmation, your chain will be visible to everyone connected to the test-net on the discover page or connect page. This means that your chain is now live and can be connected to by others.\n\nBy following these steps, you have successfully created a secure, publicly mineable and stakeable blockchain on the Verus platform, supporting zk-SNARKs and smart transactions, and resistant to 51% hash attacks. You can now mine and stake your own project, and even use the same hash power to mine and stake up to 14 other coins, earning cryptocurrency while supporting other projects.",
            "5 \u2013 Finish the create form (Steps 5 \u2013 6)\nAfter you\u2019ve finished specifying your chain to your needs, you\u2019ll need to provide it with two public nodes (that are going to run your chain) to start on. Setup your own first public nodes, or, ask the helpful community on the Verus discord to help you bootstrap your chain and give you some addresses to use. This step will be automated soon, but for now, you\u2019ll need to provide initial nodes manually.\nAfter you\u2019ve sorted that out, review your chain data, and press \u201cconfirm\u201d when you\u2019re ready!\nIf a little green window pops up in the corner of your screen, congratulations! You\u2019ve started a chain! Otherwise, you\u2019ll get a little error message telling you what\u2019s wrong.\n\nOnce the transaction that created your chain gets one confirmation (you can see this on your transactions screen), everyone connected to the test-net will be able to see your chain on the discover page, or search for it on the connect page, and connect to it!\nYou\u2019ve just launched a secure, zk-SNARK and smart transaction supporting, 51% hash attack resistant, publicly mineable and stakeable blockchain in 5 simple steps, on a decentralized platform, without requiring or relying on any centralized entity. What\u2019s even better is that you can mine and stake your own project and use the same hash power to mine and stake up to 14 other coins, earning cryptocurrency while helping other teams and realizing your own unique vision!",
