            "How do governments, particularly the US government, benefit from controlling a reserve currency, and what are the limitations and challenges of creating community currencies in the pre-blockchain era?",
            "Governments, particularly the US government, benefit significantly from controlling a reserve currency like the US dollar. As the master of the global reserve currency, the US government can run persistently high budget and trade deficits, and expand the money supply at will, while still maintaining a strong dollar. This allows the government to have enormous aggregate value, which can be used to its advantage. Additionally, powerful private forces, such as Wall Street and the Defense Industry, may also benefit from their proximity to the controller of the USD, potentially tapping into the Community Contributed Value.\n\nIn the pre-blockchain era, creating community currencies was challenging due to several reasons. Currency issuance in the paper money world was difficult to control and had huge security and moral hazard issues, such as counterfeiting and over-issuance. These currencies could not be made transparent or auditable, and the funds could not be reasonably saved or protected in banks. Furthermore, it was not plausible to have readily available conversion at market rates between the community currency and the USD, nor was it possible to keep a local currency at a stable and predictable value. For users, using community currency was hard, and for communities, making community currency was hard. As a result, most community currency efforts failed.\n\nIn contrast, the blockchain era has brought new possibilities for community currencies, with the ability to create auditable, transparent tokens at will, such as ERC-20s. This has revived interest in community currencies, offering new solutions to the challenges faced in the pre-blockchain era.",
            "he US government. In the fiat period, as the master of the global reserve currency, the US government has proven that this aggregate value is enormous, allowing the government and country to run persistently high budget and trade deficits, and expand the money supply at will, while still maintaining a strong dollar.\nIn addition, although specific research is hard to find on this issue, it does seem as if powerful private forces that are adjacent to the United States Government, such as Wall Street and the Defense Industry, are conferred certain advantages through their proximity to the controller of the USD. Connected and powerful people and corporations may be, directly or indirectly, tapping into this Community Contributed Value.\nSolutions \u2014 pre-Blockchain\nAll of this is obvious enough to have given rise to a long history of efforts to start local community currencies, to keep some of this contributed value in the community. Prior to the development of the blockchain, these efforts really seem to have been doomed from the start. Currency issuance in the paper money world is difficult to control and has huge security and moral hazard issues (counterfeit, over-issuance, etc). These currencies cannot easily be made transparent, or auditable. The funds can\u2019t be reasonably saved or protected in banks. There is no plausible way to have readily available conversion at market rates between the community currency and the USD, nor is it plausible to keep a local currency at a stable and predictable value. For users, using community currency was hard, and for communities, making community currency was hard \u2014 and so, except for a handful (or less), every effort ran aground.\nSolutions \u2014 in the Dawn of the Blockchain Era\nInterest in community currencies perked up in the blockchain era, as it became clear that auditable, transparent tokens could be created at will (eg. ERC-20s), a",
