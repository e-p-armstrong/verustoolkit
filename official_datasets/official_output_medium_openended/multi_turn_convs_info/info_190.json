            "What are the challenges and limitations that creators face when trying to create social tokens on existing platforms, and how do these limitations hinder innovation and the emergence of new modes of organization and value creation?",
            "When creators want to create social tokens on existing platforms, they face several challenges and limitations. On platforms like Roll and Rally, creators have to go through a detailed application process and wait for approval, which can be a barrier to entry. Additionally, these platforms take a portion of the creator's token, which can be a significant cost. Even for creators who want to \"do it themselves,\" the process of setting up a social token can be arduous and limiting, requiring significant technical expertise.\n\nThese limitations hinder innovation and the emergence of new modes of organization and value creation in several ways. Firstly, the requirement for technical expertise limits the pool of potential creators, making it difficult for non-technical creators to participate. Secondly, the approval process and token fees can create a significant barrier to entry, making it difficult for creators to experiment with social tokens without significant upfront costs. Finally, the lack of ease of use and high costs of creating social tokens limits the possibility of permissionless experiments, making it difficult for unexpected modes of organization and value creation to emerge.\n\nOverall, these limitations mean that social tokens have yet to fulfill their promise, and creators are not able to easily experiment with social tokens in a low-cost, low-risk way. This limits the potential for innovation and the emergence of new modes of organization and value creation.",
            "interested in creating a social token is met with an odd reality in the \u201cdecentralized\u201d blockchain world. Both Roll and Rally, the social token leaders, require creators to go through a detailed application process, and then wait for approval. The Rally website says they\u2019re looking for: \u201c1) Evidence of a significant community size, \u2026 2) Evidence of current transaction activity within your community \u2026 3) Evidence that you have strongly considered the role that a social token economy would play in your ongoing projects.\u201d Creators then wait for a review before being approved. Roll\u2019s business model is to take a portion of the creator\u2019s token for themselves. Rally\u2019s is a little more sophisticated, attempting to have value created in their own token and sidechain in the process.\nThis makes sense for Roll and Rally because there is significant engineering and other work required to get the contracts up and running that define the social token and provide it liquidity. Creators who want to \u201cdo it themselves\u201d are met with an arduous and limiting process \u2014 essentially, they need to be decent developers to get their tokens going. And to do all that for a one-dimensional token that can only be sent back and forth or placed in an AMM seems to be an unattractive proposition.\nThe result is that social tokens have yet to fulfill their promise. There\u2019s no easy way for just anyone to do permissionless experiments at little cost, and little risk. And, when they do experiment, there is only the hope that by tying real world activities to their token, they might generate some value there, at least while they continue to offer those activities. This purported value is difficult to measure, and tough to capture, and exhausting to maintain. So there\u2019s no real innovation and no \u201clong tail\u201d that allows unexpected modes of organization and value creation to emerge.\nNew Capabilities\nWhat would i",
