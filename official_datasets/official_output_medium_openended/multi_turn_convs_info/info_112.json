            "What are the main differences between the first and second generations of tBTC, and how can I add and bridge tBTC ERC-20 to the Verus blockchain using Verus Mobile and the Verus-Ethereum Bridge?",
            "The main differences between the first and second generations of tBTC are related to decentralization and scalability. The first generation of tBTC is a centralized model that requires trust in a third party and is susceptible to censorship, which goes against the principles of Bitcoin as a sovereign, secure, and permissionless digital asset. On the other hand, the second generation of tBTC, also known as tBTC v2, is a truly decentralized and scalable bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing Bitcoin holders with secure and open access to the broader DeFi ecosystem.\n\nTo add tBTC ERC-20 to Verus Mobile, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open Verus Mobile and press the plus button in the bottom-right corner.\n2. Press \"Add ERC-20 Token\".\n3. Select the checkmark to \"Find using mapped PBaaS currency\" and fill in \"tbtc.veth\", then press Continue.\n4. Press OK when a warning screen pops up.\n\nAfter adding tBTC ERC-20 to Verus Mobile, you can bridge it to the Verus blockchain using the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge. Here's how:\n\n**Bridging with MetaMask and the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website:**\n\n1. Connect MetaMask with the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website: https://eth.verusbridge.io/.\n2. Enter the address where you want the tBTC to end up on the Verus blockchain.\n3. Select \"[tBTC v2] as tBTC.vETH\" as the token.\n4. Choose the destination as \"[tBTC v2] as tBTC.vETH on VRSC\".\n5. Choose the amount you want to bridge over.\n\n**Bridging with Verus Mobile:**\n\nThe process of bridging with Verus Mobile is similar to the one with MetaMask, but you will use the Verus Mobile app instead of MetaMask. The steps are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but it is implied that you can use Verus Mobile to bridge tBTC ERC-20 to the Verus blockchain.\n\nIn summary, tBTC v2 is a decentralized and scalable bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum, and you can add and bridge tBTC ERC-20 to the Verus blockchain using Verus Mobile and the Verus-Ethereum Bridge.",
