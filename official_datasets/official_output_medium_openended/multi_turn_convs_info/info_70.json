            "How does Verus approach smart transactions, and what benefits do its decentralized backend and identity management system provide for developers building dApps?",
            "Verus takes a unique approach to smart transactions, which sets it apart from traditional blockchain-based systems. In Verus, smart transactions are natively supported by the protocol, allowing for an unlimited number of friendly name currencies and blockchains to be launched, sent, converted, or operated across chains. This means that developers can create dApps that can interact with multiple currencies and blockchains seamlessly, without the need for additional layers of complexity.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Verus's approach is its decentralized backend, which is based on the Internet of Value. This allows dApps to communicate with the backend via a standard RPC API, without the need for a centralized authority or intermediary. This decentralization enables unlimited scalability, as well as the ability to connect multiple systems and chains.\n\nAnother significant advantage of Verus is its identity management system. Identities are a first-class concept in Verus, and are fully supported by the protocol. This means that developers can create dApps that utilize decentralized, user-controlled authentication and authorization protocols, which are enabled by QR codes or deep links. These protocols can be bridged to OAuth or OpenID Connect, but can also be used natively, without the need for a service provider.\n\nVerus identities are multisig, meaning that they can be controlled by multiple parties, and have revocation and recovery capabilities. They are also transferable, and can have rights bound into them in a provable manner via the contentmultimap. This provides a high degree of flexibility and security for developers building dApps.\n\nOverall, Verus's approach to smart transactions and identity management provides a powerful and flexible platform for developers to build dApps that can interact with multiple currencies and blockchains, while also providing a high degree of decentralization, security, and scalability.",
            "g unexpected behaviors, and everyone must create their version of these contracts to build a dApp.\nVerus Smart Transactions\nIn Verus, it\u2019s a new model as follows:\nYour dApp can run on a client or on a broad range of resource types, and it communicates via the same RPC API as the CLI commands (optionally without wallet or control functions) with a fully functional, decentralized backend, which is the Internet of Value, including all its unlimited scale, connected systems and chains.\nUnlike a single currency blockchain, Verus smart transactions natively support an unlimited number of friendly name currencies directly via protocol and an unlimited number of blockchains for currency launches, simple sends, currency conversions, or cross-chain operations. All inputs, outputs, cross-chain imports, and even conversions are validated and in/out values of all currencies accounted for by consensus, just as native currency ins and outs are on single-currency blockchains.\nIdentities are a first class concept in the primitives available for dApps. They all support fully available, open, decentralized, user controlled authentication and authorization protocols, enabled by QR code or deep links and supportive of permission granting, ID provisioning/sale by the dApp, private/attested KYC and other services. These protocols can easily be bridged to OAuth or OpenID Connect via servers like Hydra, but used natively, they require no service provider between the service actually authenticating the user and the user themselves.\nEvery identity is multisig and has revocation and recovery capabilities. They are also transferable and can have rights bound into them in a provable manner via the contentmultimap. All of this is supported as primitives in the core RPC/CLI api/command line and in the core protocol.\nIDs enable their holders to launch like-named currencies, blockchains, and single NF",
