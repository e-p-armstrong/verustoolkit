            "What are the key benefits of the Verus Protocol, and how does it address major issues with Ethereum and other VM-centric networks?",
            "The Verus Protocol is an innovative solution that tackles several major issues present in Ethereum and other VM-centric networks. By using smart transactions instead of smart contracts, the Verus Protocol offers a more straightforward, secure, and scalable way to develop decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nOne of the primary advantages of the Verus Protocol is its ability to solve the problem of gas fees. Unlike traditional VM-centric networks, Verus enables unlimited scale without the need for expensive gas fees. Additionally, the Verus Protocol is not vulnerable to smart contract hacks and bugs, ensuring a more secure environment for users.\n\nAnother significant benefit of the Verus Protocol is its built-in identity model, known as VerusID. This allows applications to leverage and profit from the identity model, providing a more comprehensive and integrated solution. Furthermore, the Verus Protocol includes provable cross-chain and multichain support, enabling seamless interactions between different blockchain networks.\n\nThe Verus Protocol also addresses the issue of Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) at the protocol level, ensuring a more fair and transparent environment for all users. Moreover, the protocol eliminates the need for insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms, providing a more secure and user-friendly experience.\n\nIn contrast to traditional VM-centric networks, which require expensive Solidity developers, the Verus Protocol does not require specialized knowledge of Solidity unless the application also needs to interact with Ethereum. This makes it more accessible and easier to use for developers.\n\nOverall, the Verus Protocol offers a more capable, secure, and scalable solution for developing decentralized applications, making it an attractive alternative to traditional VM-centric networks like Ethereum.",

The global event for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovations this year. Here, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency enthusiasts gather to explore the newest advancements in the industry.The L0/1 Verus Protocol Solves Major Issues with Ethereum and Other VM-centric Networks\nDeveloping dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions. The Verus Protocol solves issues with gas fees, enables unlimited scale, is not vulnerable to smart contract hacks and bugs, addresses MEV at the protocol level, provides an identity model (VerusID) that applications can leverage and profit from, includes provable cross-chain and multichain support, does away with insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms, and does not require expensive Solidity developers for applications, unless they must also have an Ethereum component to them.\nAll these issues are solved with the L0/1 Verus Protocol. Verus does not use smart contracts \u2014 it uses smart transactions. Verus smart transactions [read more] are much easier to use (no programming needed) in practice to achieve most capabilities, if not all, compared to VM-protocols that use smart contracts. Yet Verus is still fully interoperable with Ethereum through the non-custodial, trustless and decentralized Verus-Ethereum Bridge with liquidity pool currency [more on the Bridge].\nShowcasing Verus Ap",
