            "When launching a blockchain network or gateway, there are security considerations to take into account when deciding between auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options. These options differ in their approach to establishing a proof root, which is a critical component of cross-chain transactions.\n\nIn auto-notarization, the proof root determination is enhanced, but not dependent on the multisig agreement of notary witnesses. This approach allows for a permissionless model, where anyone can import cross-chain transaction bundles without requiring the participation of notary witnesses. However, this approach may compromise on security, as it relies on the integrity of the proof root determination process.\n\nOn the other hand, notary-confirm notarization requires the honest participation of a majority of notary witnesses to establish a cross-network cryptographic proof root. This approach provides an additional layer of security, as it ensures that the proof root is validated by multiple parties. This approach also allows for further decentralization, as notary witnesses can be represented by revocable and recoverable IDs.\n\nWhen choosing between these options, it is essential to consider the security demands of the network. Factors to consider include the number of notaries required, the structure of witness IDs, and additional safeguards to enhance security. Understanding the resulting security profile from each set of choices is crucial to ensure the integrity and security of the network.\n\nIn general, auto-notarization may be suitable for networks that prioritize permissionless operations and speed, while notary-confirm notarization may be more suitable for networks that prioritize security and decentralization. Ultimately, the choice between these options depends on the specific needs and goals of the network.",
            "ions as part of the merge mining or staking process, confirm other notarizations entered by past validators, and a majority of notaries sign and witness their recognition of those events, a proof root that can be used by anyone to prove committed bundles of cross-chain transactions is established on both systems for the other. As the protocol ensures via cryptographic proof validation that the cross-chain bundles are the exact bundles in the order they were packaged on the source system, importing cross-chain transaction bundles is a permissionless operation that anyone, usually a validator, can perform, which relies on the proof established in relation to a confirmed, notarized proof root.\nDo auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options have different security considerations?\nYes. Proper planning and selection of options and witness ID structure during the launch of a blockchain network or gateway can ensure that security levels meet network demands. There are security tradeoffs between auto-notarization and notary-confirm options, which basically are a tradeoff between a permissionless model where proof root determination is enhanced, but not dependent upon multisig agreement of notary witnesses, auto-notarization vs. a model where establishing any cross-network cryptographic proof root requires the honest participation of a majority of the notary witnesses, which can be represented by revocable and recoverable IDs, allowing for further decentralization, even while requiring participation of a quorum.\nDetermining which option to choose, how many and what notaries to choose, what other safeguards can further enhance security, and then understanding the resulting security profile from each set of choices, is important when launching a blockchain or gateway. The following outlines the current high-level security considerations when configuring a new chain ",
