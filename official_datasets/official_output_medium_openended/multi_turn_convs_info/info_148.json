            "What is the Verus Protocol, and how did it receive recognition from Fidelity's Center for Applied Technology?",
            "The Verus Protocol is a decentralized, people-powered protocol designed to enable collaboration worldwide in ways that haven't been possible before. It's a public infrastructure protocol that can be used by individuals, communities, organizations, or governments to power their economies as part of a larger worldwide network of economies.\n\nThe Verus Protocol was recognized by Fidelity's Center for Applied Technology with its 'Inspiration Award' at the Future Horizons event in Ireland. This event, hosted by Dogpatch and FCAT, aimed to ignite emerging ideas and propel Fidelity into the future. The Verus Protocol was selected as one of the 7 finalists out of over 200 disruptors from across Europe, under the themes of 'Future Money & Assets', 'Web3', 'Post-Pandemic Impacts', and 'Zero Interfaces'.\n\nMichael Toutonghi, the lead developer of the Verus Protocol, presented an overview of the protocol and its capabilities, highlighting its potential to create a truly decentralized and people-powered economy. The Verus community was excited to receive this recognition, which acknowledges the innovation and efforts of the community-driven protocol.\n\nThe Verus Protocol is currently focused on its Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) upgrade, which will enable even more functionality and features for its users. This recognition from Fidelity's Center for Applied Technology is a testament to the potential of the Verus Protocol to shape the future of economies and collaboration worldwide.",
