    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about blockchain voting, but I'm not really sure how it works or what the challenges are. Can you explain what the challenges of implementing blockchain voting are, and how Verus Coin addresses these challenges by providing a secure, scalable, and trustless voting system, alongside a secure identification system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBlockchain voting is indeed a complex and fascinating topic. Implementing blockchain voting is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple factors, including privacy, transparency, and security. One of the primary challenges is achieving true anonymity while still verifying identities. This is difficult because traditional methods of ensuring privacy, such as knowledge proofs, ring transactions, and encryption methods, each have their own benefits, drawbacks, and technical challenges.\n\nIn addition to these technical challenges, there are also broader concerns about the impact of big data on individual privacy and power dynamics. Big data often collects vast amounts of personal information about individuals, but its own operations are opaque, leading to a lack of transparency. This can result in a loss of individual and collective identity, as well as an imbalance of power between governments, corporations, and ordinary individuals.\n\nVerus Coin addresses these challenges by providing a secure, scalable, and trustless voting system that can be used in various electoral models. This system is designed to allow everyone in a governed society, corporation, or group to have a fair opportunity to contribute to their community and have their opinion represented without worrying about corruption or fraud.\n\nFurthermore, Verus Coin's secure identification system ensures that individuals can verify their identities without compromising their privacy. This combination of secure voting and identification systems enables a more democratic and participatory process, where everyone can have a voice and be represented without fear of manipulation or exploitation.\n\nIn essence, Verus Coin's solution provides a way to promote transparency, accountability, and individual empowerment, while also protecting privacy and preventing the abuse of power.\n\nDo you have any further questions about blockchain voting, or how Verus Coin's system addresses these challenges?",

True anonymity at the same time as verified identity is the big challenge of blockchain voting.\n- How Blockchain Voting Works & Why We Need It\nPrivacy has to be default because privacy is a limit on government power, as well as the power of private sector companies.\nThe transparency paradox: big data collects all kinds of personal data about individuals, but its own operations are completely opaque.\nThe identity paradox: big data seeks to identify at the expense of individual and collective identity.\nThe power paradox: while seen as useful for public interest, big data privileges governments and corporate entities at the expense of ordinary individuals.\n- HOW BIG DATA CAN BE USED AGAINST YOU\nRemember the story about how Target figured out a teen girl was pregnant before her Father did?\nIf we send someone a catalog and say, \u2018Congratulations on your first child!\u2019 and they\u2019ve never told us they\u2019re pregnant, that\u2019s going to make some people uncomfortable,\u201d Pole told me. \u201cWe are very conservative about compliance with all privacy laws. But even if you\u2019re following the law, you can do things where people get queasy.\n- HOW COMPANIES LEARN YOUR SECRETS\nIf you ask an expert what Verus Coin is, you might hear this\u2026\nThe biggest asset we see Verus creating in today\u2019s modern world is a secure, scalable, trustless voting system, able to be used in all different kinds of electoral models, in parallel with a secure, scalable identification system. This combination would allow everyone in either a governed society, corporation, or any group to have a chance to fairly contribute to their community, and have their opinion represented without having to worry about corruption, or fraud. \u2014 Mike Toutonghi\nRemember the claims of fake news that surrounded the USA a",
