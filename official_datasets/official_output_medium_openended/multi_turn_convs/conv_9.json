How do I secure my wallet and what steps do I need to take to import my \"Lite mode\" wallet to Agama Native?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSecuring your Verus wallet is a top priority to protect your assets. Don't worry, I've got you covered.\n\n**Securing Your Wallet:**\nTo secure your Verus wallet, make sure to store it in a safe location, either physically or digitally. It's essential to keep your `wallet.dat` file secure and regularly back it up. Note that the entire VRSC folder is quite large, so it's impractical to backup the whole folder.

Here's how:\n\n1. **Access the Import Key Button:** In the upper left corner of Verus Agama in Native mode, you'll find an \"Import key\" button. Click on it, and a modal will appear.\n2. **Enter Your Seed:** Simply enter the Seed used to create your \"Lite mode\" wallet and click Import.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to secure your Verus wallet and import your \"Lite mode\" wallet to Agama Native, ensuring a smooth transition and protecting your assets.\n\nDo you have any further questions about securing your wallet or the import process?",
