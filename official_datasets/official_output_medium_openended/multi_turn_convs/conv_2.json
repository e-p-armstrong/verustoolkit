Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n**Verus Desktop:**\n\n1. Click the \"Convert Currencies\" button and then go to the \"Advanced\" tab.\n2. Choose the amount you want to send and fill in the \"From Currency\" and \"To Currency\" fields with the desired currencies (e.g., DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH, EURC.vETH, VRSC).\n3. Fill in the \"Via Currency\" field with Switch.\n4. Enter the destination address where you want to receive the currency (R-/i-address or VerusID).\n5. Click \"Convert Currencies\" and wait between 1 and 5 blocks for the transaction to be processed.\n\nIf you want to convert to Switch, simply fill in \"To Currency\" with Switch and leave out the \"Via Currency\" field.\n\n**Verus Mobile:**\n\n1. Press the currency you want to convert (e.g., DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH, EURC.vETH, VRSC).\n2. Press \"Send\" and then \"Convert or cross-chain\".\n3. Press \"Convert currency\".\n4.

Press \"Send\" and confirm, and wait between 1 and 5 blocks for the transaction to be processed.\n\nAs for the benefits of using Verus, there are several that set it apart from other cryptocurrency protocols. Some of these benefits include:\n\n* **Scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security**: Verus solves the scalability problem by neither sacrificing decentralization nor security.\n* **Non-custodial and trustless Verus-Ethereum Bridge**: The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is a decentralized bridge that allows for seamless interactions between the Verus and Ethereum networks.\n* **Launch currencies without coding**: Verus allows users to launch their own currencies without needing to write any code.\n* **Launch fully interoperable, independent, and customizable PBaaS-blockchains**: Verus enables users to launch their own independent and customizable blockchains that are fully interoperable with other Verus-based blockchains.\n* **VerusID: self-sovereign identities**: VerusID is a decentralized identity system that allows users to have full control over their identities and data.\n* **Verus DeFi: simple, low-cost, MEV-resistant**: Verus DeFi is a decentralized finance platform that offers simple, low-cost, and MEV-resistant (miner extractable value-resistant) transactions.\n\nOverall, Verus offers a unique set of features and benefits that make it an attractive option for those looking to explore the world of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance.\n\nDo you have any more questions about converting currencies on Verus, or would you like to know more about any of these benefits?",
