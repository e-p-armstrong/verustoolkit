    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get started with staking on Verus, but I'm not sure what the requirements are or how to enable it in the desktop wallet. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo stake with Verus, your wallet must meet certain requirements. First, your wallet must hold funds in one or more transparent addresses or VerusIDs. Second, your wallet must be running, online, and synced to the Verus blockchain on a system with an accurate system clock. Finally, staking must be enabled in the wallet software.\n\nBy default, staking is disabled to prevent unintentional staking from multiple computers or creating problems with accounting for staked funds when they\u2019re not expected. It's important to note that addresses or wallets should only be staked from a single computer.\n\nTo enable staking in the Verus Desktop wallet, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Verus Desktop wallet.\n2. Go to the Mining tab.\n3. On the mining dashboard, click the icon of the dollar sign with a slash through it to enable staking.\n\nBy following these steps, you can enable staking in the Verus Desktop wallet and start participating in the Verus network. Do you have any further questions about staking with Verus, or would you like more information on how it works?",
