    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about creating a currency on the Verus network. Can you walk me through the process of defining a currency, and how it works with VerusID namespace and multi-signature setup?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDefining a currency on the Verus network involves a few steps, and I'd be happy to explain it in detail. Let's go through an example of creating a currency for a fictional company called \"Very Good Gold\" (VGG).\n\n**VerusID Namespace:**\nBefore defining the currency, we need to register a VerusID, which is the namespace for currencies and PBaaS-blockchains, among other things. In this case, we registered the VerusID `VGG@`, which cost us 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 when using a referral). These costs are distributed to the block producers and can vary depending on which PBaaS-blockchain we create a VerusID.\n\n**Multi-Signature Setup:**\nIn this example, we have a 2 of 2 signature setup, which means the identity is controlled by two primary addresses, with always two signatures needed to do any action (like launching the currency, minting, burning, and sending). This ensures that no single entity has full control over the currency.\n\n**Defining the Currency:**\nDefining a currency on the Verus network involves two commands. The first command defines the currency, and the second command launches it. The cost of defining a currency is 200 VRSCTEST, which can change depending on the network conditions. Once the currency is successfully launched, it can flow around within the protocol and outside of the protocol.\n\n**Currency Launch:**\nAfter defining the currency, we can launch it on the Verus network. The launch process involves minting and burning capabilities, which need to be approved by two signers in this 2 of 2 signature setup. This ensures that the issuer of the token does not have full control over the currency.\n\nOverall, defining a currency on the Verus network involves registering a VerusID, setting up a multi-signature setup, defining the currency, and launching it on the network. The Verus network provides a secure and decentralized way to create and manage currencies, with features like multi-signature setup and PBaaS-blockchain integration.\n\nDo you have any further questions about defining a currency on the Verus network, or would you like more information on any of the steps involved?",

            "\ud83d\udcdd Note that this walkthrough is for the Verus Testnet blockchain, which already has the functionalities that the PBaaS-upgrade (Public Blockchains as a Service) will bring to mainnet. Also, the commands are for macOS and Linux, as Windows works a bit differently. We use the CLI wallet for Verus. Download here \ud83d\udd17 You can also use Verus Desktop with its incorporated terminal.\nFictional Company \u201cVery Good Gold\u201d\nIn this technological showcase, we have a fictional company that is an issuer of a centralized token with 1:1 backing of gold. With a starting supply of 0. The issuer of this token has full control of minting and burning capabilities.\nThe mint and burn process however needs to be approved by two signers, making sure one entity doesn\u2019t have full control. For this example we use a 2 of 2 signature setup. Any signature setup is possible (with a maximum of 13 of 25), depending on different use cases.\nDefining a Currency\nDefining a currency on the Verus network is simple, just two commands. When the currency is successfully launched it can flow around within the protocol, and outside of the protocol (learn how to export a currency as an ERC-20 to Ethereum \ud83d\udd17). Let\u2019s get started.\nVerusID NamespaceBefore defining the currency, we already registered the VerusID VGG@. This cost us 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 when using a referral), which were distributed to the block producers.
