    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and I'm curious about Stake Guard. Can you explain what it is, and how it solves the \"nothing at stake\" problem in Proof of Stake (PoS) transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"nothing at stake\" problem is a well-known issue in Proof of Stake (PoS) transactions, and Stake Guard is a Crypto Condition (CC) developed by Verus to address it. \n\nStake Guard is a Crypto Condition (CC) developed by Verus to address the \"nothing at stake\" problem in Proof of Stake (PoS) transactions. This problem arises when a staker can attempt to stake on multiple forks at the same block height without penalty, allowing them to potentially cheat the system.\n\nTo solve this issue, Stake Guard works in conjunction with a modified signing script when staking and spending a reward. This results in a blockchain-level Crypto Condition that handles all staking transaction spends. The Stake Guard ensures that only legitimate stake rewards can be spent when proven, preventing double spending and cheating.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nWhen staking a new block, a new format of transaction called a Staking Transaction is generated. This transaction format is enforced and utilizes the Stake Guard at the minting of the new block. It contains additional metadata, such as:\n\n1. The public key of the staker who signed it\n2. The UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)\n3. The block height\n4. The previous block height\n\nIf a cheater attempts to stake on more forks at the same block height, the cheat attempt is recorded and made visible to anyone scanning the blockchain. The data is immutable and cannot be manipulated, ensuring that the cheat attempt is verifiable.\n\nStake Guard is a powerful tool that extends the flexibility and power of the Verus blockchain, preparing it for future services and PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) capabilities.\n\nDo you have any more questions about Stake Guard or how it solves the \"nothing at stake\" problem?",

With the modified CCs Verus is able to implement powerful functionality that extends the flexibility and resultant power of the Verus blockchain in preparation for PBaaS and the services which will be able to be coded into blockchains in the future.\nStake Guard is the first Verus Crypto Condition to be released and it\u2019s what solves the \u201cnothing at stake\u201d problem and performs the \u201cmagic\u201d.\nStake Guard \u2014 The Proof of Stake Crypto Condition\nThis new CC which Verus has developed and is adding to the blockchain, works in conjunction with a newly modified signing script when staking and spending a reward.\nThe result is a blockchain-level Crypto Condition which handles all staking transaction spends, either processing them as usual for normal shakers, or allowing any cheated stake transaction containing its stake block reward to be spent by anyone who can prove its indeed a cheaters stake. No double spending occurs at any point, to cheat the cheater had a real stake plus additional cheat attempts at any given block. Only the legitimate stake reward can be spent when proven.\nHere\u2019s how it works.\nWhen staking a new block, a new format of transaction called a Staking Transaction is generated. This transaction format is enforced and utilizes the Stake Guard at the minting of the new block. It contains more meta data, such as the public key of the staker who signed it, the UTXO, the block height, and previous block height.\nIf a cheater has tried to stake on more forks at the same block height, that cheat attempt is also recorded. Anyone scanning the blockchain can see it and verify that it\u2019s indeed a cheat attempt, as the data is there immutably and without the ability to manipulate things like UTXO or information about the blockchain at the time of the stake.\nFor the community, this is an opportunity of 100 blocks to loo",
