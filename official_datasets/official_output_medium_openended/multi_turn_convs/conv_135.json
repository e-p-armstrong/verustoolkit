    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the process of cross-chain transactions between Verus and Ethereum. Can you walk me through how it works, and how these transactions are confirmed and rewarded?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe process of cross-chain transactions between Verus and Ethereum involves several steps. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:\n\n**Step 1: Rolling up transactions into a CCE**\nCross-chain transactions are rolled up into a single unit called a Cross-Chain Export (CCE). This CCE is then added to a block by a miner or staker, who receives a fee for doing so.\n\n**Step 2: Adding CCE to the blockchain**\nThe CCE is officially part of the blockchain once it's added to a block, and it's linked to the \"stateroot\" (Merkle Mountain Range), which is an unchangeable overall summary of the blockchain at that block, and anything preceding it.\n\n**Step 3: Notarizations**\nAs the transactions (CCE) are being mined (or staked) in, the notarizations are also being mined or staked in, confirmed by miners and stakers, and only then, signed by the notary witnesses. Notarizations can occur as often as every 10 blocks, depending on how many miners and stakers are running Bridgekeeper.\n\n**Step 4: Confirming notarizations**\nBefore a notarization is used as proof, it has to be on the blockchain for 10 blocks, confirmed by another notarization, and also signed by at least 8 of 15 notary witnesses worldwide.\n\n**Step 5: Sending notarization to Ethereum**\nOnce the notarization is confirmed on Verus, it's sent over to Ethereum, where it becomes pending. Once confirmed on Ethereum by receiving another notarization, the transactions (CCE) in that block are sent over to the Ethereum smart contract, along with the Merkle Mountain Range proof.\n\n**Step 6: Validating and sending assets**\nIf the proof is valid, the assets are sent to the user's Ethereum wallet.\n\n**Rewards and incentives**\nAnyone can roll up the transactions into a CCE and mine it in to get a reward. Additionally, the notary witnesses who pay the ETH fees to send it to Ethereum get a share of the fees to subsidize their transaction costs. If there is no traffic from Verus to Ethereum, the notarizations are continued to be mined in on Verus, but do not need to be sent to Ethereum, minimizing costs.\n\nThe process is slightly different for transactions going from Ethereum to Verus, but the overall concept of rolling up transactions, notarizing, and confirming them remains the same.\n\nDo you have any further questions about cross-chain transactions between Verus and Ethereum, or would you like me to clarify any of these steps?",

            "assed, these cross-chain transactions are rolled up into something called a \u2018CCE\u2019 (cross-chain export). This CCE is then added to a block by a miner or staker and they are rewarded a fee for doing so. The CCE is now officially part of the blockchain, and is linked to the \u201cstateroot\u201d (Merkle Mountain Range, which is an unchangeable overall summary of the blockchain at that block, and anything preceding it).\nMeanwhile, as the transactions (CCE) are being mined (or staked) in, the notarizations are also being mined or staked in, confirmed by miners and stakers, and only then, signed by the notary witnesses. The notarizations can occur as often as every 10 blocks, depending on how many miners and stakers are running Bridgekeeper. Before a notarization is used as proof, it has to be on the blockchain for 10 blocks, confirmed by another notarization, and also signed by at least 8 of 15 notary witnesses worldwide.\nThen when the notarization is confirmed on Verus, it\u2019s sent over to Ethereum and becomes pending on Ethereum. Once confirmed on Ethereum by receiving another notarization, the transactions (CCE) in that block are sent over to the Ethereum smart contract, along with the Merkle Mountain Range proof. If valid the assets are sent to the users Ethereum wallet.\nAnyone can roll up the transactions into a CCE and mine it in to get a reward, but also the notary witnesses paying the ETH fees to send it to Ethereum get a share of the fees to subsidize their transaction costs.\nIf there is no traffic from Verus to Ethereum, the notarizations are continued to be mined in on Verus but do not need to be sent to Ethereum, so when the traffic is light, there is minimal cost.\nEthereum \u27a1\ufe0f Verus\nThe above part explains going from Verus to Ethereum, but the other way around is actually a little bit different. It is not the notary witnesses that send the group of transactions over, but a",
