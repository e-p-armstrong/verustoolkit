    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've finally set up my Verus wallet! What happens next, and are there any ways to engage with the Verus community?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCongratulations on setting up your Verus wallet! Now that you've got your wallet up and running, you can return to the Transactions screen to verify your new transparent balance and see the confirmations coming in. Once you have 150 confirmations, your mature transparent balance will be in UTXO form and will start staking, allowing you to earn VRSC rewards for helping to secure the Verus blockchain.\n\nBut that's not all! Verus is a community-driven project, and we'd love for you to get involved. To further engage with the Verus community, you can join the official Verus Discord, which is a great platform to connect with other community members, get help with any questions you may have, and find ways to contribute to the project. The Discord community is active and thriving, and by joining, you can stay updated on the latest developments, innovations, and community initiatives.\n\nYou can also reach out to community members, such as John Westbrook, for guidance and support. They're always happy to help and offer their expertise. Overall, the Verus community is a great resource for learning more about the project, getting involved, and earning more Verus rewards. By joining the community and participating in discussions, you can help shape the future of Verus and be a part of its growth and development.\n\nDo you have any questions about getting started with the Discord community or how to get involved with Verus?",
