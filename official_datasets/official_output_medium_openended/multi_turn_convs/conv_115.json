    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been wondering about social tokens and their liquidity. What are the limitations of social tokens and their liquidity, and how do they rely on creators' ongoing efforts to maintain their value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSocial tokens, which are a type of cryptocurrency, have several limitations that affect their value and liquidity. One major issue is the difficulty in maintaining liquidity through automated market makers, as liquidity providers take on high risks, including impermanent loss risk, which can approach 100%. This makes liquidity provision a largely altruistic activity or one that is undertaken by those unaware of the risks.\n\nAs a result, social tokens often have minimal liquidity provision, leading to little market depth and unstable value. Furthermore, the value of a social token is closely tied to the creator's ongoing efforts to provide experiences, events, or products that drive continuous demand for the currency. There are no automated economic activities that can sustain the token's value, so if the creator's activity slows down or stops, the token's value will rapidly decline.\n\nThis means that social tokens require constant effort and activity from creators to maintain their value, which can be a significant challenge. If creators are unable to sustain this effort, their tokens may lose value and eventually become inactive, a common fate for many social tokens. In summary, social tokens face significant challenges in maintaining liquidity and value, and their success is heavily dependent on the ongoing efforts of their creators.\n\nDo you have any further questions about social tokens or their limitations?",

            "kill\nautomated market making \u2014 they help set up Uniswap-like liquidity provision, but to gain actual liquidity creators must, in the words of the Roll website: \u201cencourage their communities to contribute liquidity\u201d\nhanding creators a roadmap and examples to \u201cbuild value\u201d \u2014 this generally involves activities, services or products that creators will offer to their fans so that they can get their communities to buy the token and then trade the token for these goods \u2014 the idea is to generate real-world demand for the tokens\nOn the roll website, this last concept is pitched as: \u201cAfter minting, you determine all the ways your token will be distributed and used across platforms, closing the loop that gives your social token its own independent value and starts your social token economy.\u201d. But, as described in this article, \u201cI discovered that it\u2019s just a sh**tload of work to keep a token going\u201d.\nThe end result is that value in social tokens remains fleeting or aspirational. Liquidity through liquidity provision in automated market makers can be a big problem. For a liquidity provider, risks are high, probably untenable since impermanent loss risk in an AMM with a fragile token approaches 100%. It turns out that liquidity provision in this context is a wholly altruistic activity, or worse, done by people who are unaware of the enormous risks. WIth minimal liquidity provision comes little market depth and unstable value.\nAlso, value for the token is tightly locked to a creator\u2019s ongoing real world efforts to provide experiences, or events, or products, in order to drive continuous demand for the currency. There are no automated economic activities. If the creator\u2019s activity stalls, or dries up, the token will lose value rapidly. Predictably, the vast bulk of these currencies peter out, and are forgotten, living on as zombie ERC-20s on ethereum.\nNo Long Tail\nAnyone that\u2019s really ",
