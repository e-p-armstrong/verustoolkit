    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the state of innovation in open blockchain technology. What are the barriers to innovation in this space, and how does Verus address these barriers to enable entrepreneurs to bootstrap their ideas?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the author, the barriers to innovation in open blockchain technology stem from the fact that established companies are often hesitant to adopt new, open, borderless, neutral, and censorship-resistant blockchain technology. This is because they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo and may lose more than they gain by changing it.\n\nInnovative entrepreneurship, on the other hand, is driven by individuals and small groups who are willing to take risks and push the boundaries of what is possible. However, these individuals often face barriers to entry, such as lack of resources, expertise, and infrastructure.\n\nVerus addresses these barriers by providing a platform that enables entrepreneurs to bootstrap their ideas and create their own blockchains and coins. This allows them to innovate and experiment without being held back by established interests or technical limitations.\n\nThe author envisions a future where every business and project, no matter how big or small, will have its own blockchain and coin, all working together through seamless interoperability or bridging capabilities. Verus enables this vision by providing a decentralized, open, and flexible platform that allows entrepreneurs to create and deploy their own blockchain-based solutions.\n\nBy removing the barriers to innovation, Verus empowers entrepreneurs to create new and innovative products and services that can help bring people on board the crypto revolution. The author believes that this is the key to driving adoption and growth in the cryptocurrency space, and that Verus is well-positioned to enable this innovation.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the barriers to innovation in open blockchain technology, or how Verus addresses these barriers?",

This is about my perspective on what these barriers are and how Verus fixes them, without getting into all the technicalities.The Lay of the Land\nFirst, let me say this open, borderless, neutral and censorship-resistant stuff is only interesting because of exactly those qualities. It is innovation in its purest form. I can find a market, create a product, and it\u2019s there forever as long as the market exists. Not held back by anyone or anything with opposing vested interests. It\u2019s a beautiful thing.\nInnovation always comes from the bottom-up, never top-down. We are that bottom, we have that power. It may sting, hurt or annoy at first, but eventually, it is accepted and normalized. And so this (still) cowboy cryptocurrency stuff is not any different.\nAnd let\u2019s be clear, innovative entrepreneurship is what this is all about. Contrary to what many people might believe, we can not expect innovation from already established companies. We can not expect them to adopt blockchain technology that is open, borderless, neutral and censorship-resistant. They have everything to gain with keeping the status quo, and more to lose by changing it.\nThe future of cryptocurrency will be single-purpose blockchains. Every idea for a business and project, no matter how big or small, will be created with their own blockchain and thus coin. All working collectively through seamless interoperability or bridging capabilities.\nWe are at the beginning of this very young technology, we haven\u2019t seen anythi",
