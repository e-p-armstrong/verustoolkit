    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've heard about this thing called Stake Guard in Verus, but I'm not really sure what it's all about. Can you explain what Stake Guard is, and how I can enable it to catch cheaters and earn cheat rewards?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nStake Guard is a powerful feature in Verus that helps maintain the integrity of the network. I'd be happy to explain it in detail.\n\nStake Guard is a functionality in Verus that allows miners and stakers to detect and counter cheating on the network. When a cheater attempts to fork the blockchain, they create an identifiable fork that can be detected by other nodes on the network. Stake Guard enables honest miners and stakers to \"catch\" these cheaters by spending the single \"legitimate\" coinbase from the block height at which they cheated, sending it to a designated zs-address before the cheater can spend it.\n\nNow, let's talk about how to enable Stake Guard in Verus. It's a relatively simple process that involves generating a new Sapling-type zs-address and starting the Verus daemon with the `-cheatcatcher` parameter set to that address.\n\nFor users with a CLI wallet, here are the steps:\n\n**For CLI Wallet:**\n\n1. Generate a new Sapling-type zs-address using the command `./verus-cli/verus z_getnewaddress sapling`. This will echo back your new zs-address.\n2. Start your Verus daemon with the parameter `-cheatcatcher=zsaddr`, where \"zsaddr\" is your new zs-address. For example, to start the daemon staking and with Stake Guard enabled, you would run `./verus-cli/verusd -mint -cheatcatcher=zsaddr`.\n\nAnd for users with a GUI wallet:\n\n**For GUI Wallet:**\n\n1. Generate a new Sapling-type zs-address from the Send section by choosing \"Private Address (Sapling)\" from the Get New Address dropdown.\n2. Set the `-cheatcatcher` parameter to the generated zs-address in the GUI wallet settings.\n\nBy enabling Stake Guard, you not only help to maintain the integrity of the Verus network but also earn a cheat reward when you detect a cheating attempt. Additionally, Stake Guard serves as a reminder to ensure that you are not inadvertently cheating by staking on the same wallet across multiple computers, which can result in lost staked rewards.\n\nDo you have any more questions about Stake Guard or how to enable it?",

            "d to spend the coinbase in question.\nAny miner or staker who sets the \u201ccheatcatcher\u201d zs-address parameter may find an additional shielded coinbase in their cheat catching address! Again, this is not new coins being created, it\u2019s literally spending the cheaters single \u201clegitimate\u201d coinbase from the block height at which they cheated, sending it to your zs-address before they can spend it.\nMiners and stakers may also earn a cheat reward from Stake Guard when they don\u2019t earn a normal block reward as it is an equally fair functionality (when enabled) across the entire network of miners and stakers, not weighted by staking or mining power, rather dependent on which wallet \u201csees\u201d the identifiable cheated fork.\nBeyond setting your wallet up to catch cheaters, another important implication of this advancement is to also ensure you are not inadvertently cheating. If you stake on the same wallet across multiple computers, you will most likely lose your staked rewards. You should only stake from one wallet per computer at any time. While you can open the same wallet on two computers, make sure only one of those is staking and the other is not to avoid losing your coinbase rewards!\nHow to Enable Stake Guard:\nEnabling Stake Guard is simple. Following are steps for both CLI and GUI.\nFor CLI Wallet:\nFirst generate a new Sapling-type zs-address with command: \n ./verus-cli/verus z_getnewaddress sapling which will echo back your new zs-address.\nStart your Verus daemon with the parameter -cheatcatcher=zsaddr where \u201czsaddr\u201d is your new zs-address.\nFor example, to start the daemon staking and with Stake Guard enabled, you would run: ./verus-cli/verusd -mint -cheatcatcher=zsaddr\nFor GUI Wallet:\nFirst generate a new Sapling-type zs-address from the Send section by choosing \u201cPrivate Address (Sapling)\u201d from the Get New Address drop down:",
