    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in building decentralized applications, and I've been looking into the Verus network. Can you tell me more about the key features and benefits of building on Verus, and how it differs from traditional smart contract applications?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network offers a unique set of features and benefits for building decentralized applications, making it an attractive platform for developers. Here are some of the key advantages of building on Verus:\n\nThe Verus network offers a unique set of features and benefits for building decentralized applications, making it an attractive platform for developers. Here are some of the key advantages of building on Verus:\n\n1. **Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 0 (L0) protocol**: Verus is a protocol-level platform, allowing for composable and powerful multi-chain core primitives, such as identities, currencies, and liquidity baskets.\n\n2. **Decentralized and scalable**: The Verus network is fully decentralized, unlimited in scale, and secured by the 50% proof-of-stake / 50% proof-of-work, 51% hash attack resistant Verus Proof of Power (PoP) consensus.\n\n3. **Accessible from mobile clients or cloud-based web-applications**: Developers can access the Verus network securely from mobile clients or cloud-based web-applications, using QR-codes and deep-links to a client-side wallet under user control or talking directly to data-indexed, blockchain nodes.\n\n4. **Unlimited identities and databases**: The Verus network provides fast access to an unlimited number of user identities and their unlimited Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF) indexable key-value database, offering provable, optionally private, worldwide resolvable data at unlimited scale over an unlimited number of blockchains.\n\n5. **Inherent eCommerce and markets**: The Verus network includes inherent eCommerce and markets of all types, usable by applications, allowing developers to create complex and powerful decentralized applications.\n\n6. **Application-owned data stays under application control**: Unlike traditional smart contract applications, application-owned data remains under the control of the application, while user-owned data stays under user control and subject to voluntary, provable disclosure, protected by zero-knowledge privacy.\n\n7. **Flexible development**: Developers can write applications in their favorite framework, using their preferred languages, and connect to the decentralized Internet of Value through links and RPC calls.\n\nIn contrast to traditional smart contract applications, the Verus network offers a more decentralized, scalable, and secure platform for building decentralized applications. It eliminates the need for complex smart contracts, server-side APIs, and phishing-prone web interfaces, providing a more streamlined and secure development experience.\n\nDo you have any further questions about building on the Verus network, or would you like more information on any of these features?",

            "p-Development Opportunities at Consensus 2024\nGet ready for a new era of decentralized application development. Unlike today\u2019s complex smart contract applications, requiring VM-based smart contracts that talk to user facing applications through server-side APIs and phishing-prone web-interfaces using public key hashes or rented names as identity, the Verus network is a Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 0 (L0) protocol with composable and powerful multi-chain core primitives, including identities, currencies, MEV-resistant liquidity baskets, updateable, even transferable ID-bound databases that can comprise NFTs and real world assets, all on a 100% fully decentralized, unlimited scale backbone, secured by the 50% proof-of-stake / 50% proof-of-work, 51% hash attack resistant Verus Proof of Power (PoP) consensus and accessible securely from mobile clients or cloud-based web-applications.\nBuild applications in your favorite framework for clients and access the Verus network either through QR-codes and deep-links to a client-side wallet under user control or talk directly to data-indexed, blockchain nodes, capable of providing fast access to an unlimited number of user identities and their unlimited Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF) indexable key-value database providing provable, optionally private, worldwide resolvable data at unlimited scale over an unlimited number of blockchains. All of this power, including inherent eCommerce and markets of all types are usable by applications, and unlike yesterday\u2019s Internet, application-owned data stays under application control, while user-owned data remains under user control and subject to voluntary, provable disclosure, protected by zero knowledge privacy, as it should always have been.\nWrite applications your way, your client frameworks, your languages, with links and RPC calls to the decentralized Internet of Value.
