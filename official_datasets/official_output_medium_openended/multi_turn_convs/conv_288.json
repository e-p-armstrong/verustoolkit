    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to import some data into Verus, but I'm not really sure what's happening during the process. Can you explain what happens during the import process in Verus, and how do I know when it's complete?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you initiate the import process in Verus, you will be notified of its progress through messages displayed in the lower right corner of the interface. As the import begins, you will see a message indicating that the process has started. This message serves as a confirmation that the import is underway. \n\nOnce the import has successfully completed, you will receive another message in the same location, notifying you that the process is finished. This second message indicates that the import has been completed successfully, and you can proceed with using the imported data in Verus.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the import process or how to use the imported data in Verus?",
