    "How does Verus's currency conversion work, and what are the benefits of its decentralized fractional reserve currencies?",
    "Verus's currency conversion is a built-in feature of the blockchain protocol that allows for automatic and decentralized conversions between Verus and native fractional reserve currencies. This conversion process is similar to the Bancor reserve model, which is explained in detail in the Bancor whitepaper.\n\nHere's how it works: when you want to convert Verus to another currency, you don't need a buyer or seller on the other side of the transaction. Instead, the conversion is done through a protocol-level process that adjusts the currency conversion rate (price) according to proven, market-based mathematical formulas. This means that converting to a currency will cause the price to rise, while converting from it will cause the price to fall.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Verus's fractional reserve currencies is that they ensure liquidity across the ecosystem. Since the order books are always the entire supply and reserve of the currency, there can never be a shortage of liquidity. Additionally, currency can be sent automatically from the Verus blockchain to a PBaaS reserve blockchain, arriving at the specified address as either Verus Reserve Tokens or auto-converted to the native currency of the destination chain at the current market price.\n\nAnother advantage of Verus's currency conversion is its simplicity and ease of use. Unlike complex APIs that make cross-chain operations difficult for the average user, Verus's protocol makes it as easy to send from one chain to another as it is to send a simple transaction.\n\nOverall, Verus's decentralized fractional reserve currencies offer a range of benefits, including automatic and decentralized conversions, liquidity guarantees, and ease of use. These features make it an attractive solution for users who need to convert between different currencies within the Verus ecosystem.",
    "ve currency conversion is built into the blockchain protocol, charges no centralized fees, addresses the infamous front-running problem, and can be mined and staked while emitting new coins in the process, the model is very similar to Bancor reserves. The Bancor whitepaper is a good place to start if you want an introduction into cryptographic fractional reserve currencies and how conversions work. At any time and for virtually any volume, Verus will be convertible in a fully automatic way between Verus and native fractional reserve currencies through simple transactions and PBaaS reserve protocols.\nImportantly, conversion is not a buy or a sell from or to another individual, it is a protocol conversion. To convert any amount, you need no buyer on the other side of a \u201csell\u201d and no seller in order to buy. Converting to a currency will cause the currency conversion rate (price) to rise, according to proven, market-based mathematical formulas, and converting from will have the opposite effect.\nWith PBaaS reserve currencies, there cannot be a shortage of liquidity across the ecosystem, since the order books are always the entire supply and reserve of the currency. In addition, currency can be sent automatically from the Verus blockchain to a PBaaS reserve blockchain, arriving to the specified address as either Verus Reserve Tokens, or auto-converted at the current market price (causing the price to rise slightly according to the reserve currency formulas) to the native currency of the destination chain. Unlike complex APIs that make cross-chain operations difficult for the average user, the latest big advance in this area is a protocol that makes it as easy to send from one chain to another as it is today to send a simple transaction.\nVerus fractional reserve currencies will have decentralized capabilities and benefits that are fundamentally new both to crypto and also to",
