Note that the currency is not case-sensitive.\n\n**Step 3: Select the To Currency**\nEnter Bridge.vETH as the currency you want to convert to. Again, the currency is not case-sensitive.\n\n**Step 4: Enter the Destination Address**\nProvide the address where you want to receive the Bridge.vETH. This can be a R-address, i-address, or VerusID.\n\n**Step 5: Check \"Send as pre-convert\"**\nMake sure to check the \"Send as pre-convert\" option to enable preconversion.\n\n**Step 6: Enter the Refund Address**\nProvide an address where your funds will be refunded in case the preconversion fails.

    "You only need to fill in the highlighted parts of the form. See below:\nAmount: how much of vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH you want to convert to Bridge.vETH\nFrom Currency: Fill in vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH (not case sensitive)\nTo Currency: Fill in Bridge.vETH (not case sensitive)\nDestination Address: Fill in where you want to receive the Bridge.vETH (on Fri 20 Oct).

For example, when the minimum preconversion amount is not met, and thus the currency not launched, you will receive your funds back. In this case there isn\u2019t a minimum or maximum but you still need to fill it in. Can be the same as your Destination Address.\nNow click on \u201cConvert Currencies\u201d and confirm the transaction.
