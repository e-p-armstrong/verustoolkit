    "What is the vision of the Verus Coin project, and how does its innovative consensus algorithm, Proof of Power, and quantum secure hash algorithm, VerusHash 2.0, contribute to the development of decentralized applications and a marketplace of public blockchains as a service?",
    "The Verus Coin project envisions a marketplace of provisioned public blockchains as a service (PBaaS) that can be used to run public applications, including polls and voting. This vision is inspired by the original idea of bitcoin as more than just digital cash, but as a foundation for decentralized applications. The goal of Verus is to create a platform where decentralized applications can provision and use public blockchains automatically, paying Verus miners, stakers, and service providers for provisioning and services.\n\nTo achieve this vision, Verus introduces a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Power, which is a 50% proof of work / 50% proof of stake algorithm. This consensus protocol solves theoretical weaknesses in other PoS systems and is provably immune to 51% hash attacks, making Verus one of the most double-spend resistant public blockchains.\n\nAdditionally, Verus uses a unique hash algorithm, VerusHash 2.0, which is a quantum secure hash algorithm. This means that Verus is prepared for the potential threats of quantum computing and can ensure the security of its platform even in a post-quantum world. VerusHash 2.0 is also designed to be near-equally mineable on various types of hardware, making it a fair and accessible platform for miners.\n\nOverall, the Verus Coin project aims to create a decentralized platform that enables the creation of public applications and services on provisioned public blockchains, with a focus on security, fairness, and accessibility.",
    "just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org\nWhen I stumbled upon this email around the new year, it struck me how accurate these predictions have manifested. I also had to stop and look a little deeper and ask what more might Satoshi have envisioned than simply \u201cdigital cash.\u201d Although bitcoin was originally used as digital money, I believe Satoshi saw it as much, much more\u2026and believe this email eludes to it.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Blockchain?\nIt occurred to me that the simple application of money in the bitcoin, was only the beginning of progress and what is possible to expand from this original use case. Particularly the underlying theme of blockchain services is an innovative progression of the invention of bitcoin.\nThe Verus Coin\u2019s project vision is a marketplace of provisioned public blockchains as a service (PBaaS) that are used to run public applications, including polls and voting. The goal is ultimately decentralized applications that provision and use these chains automatically, paying Verus miners, stakers, and service providers for provisioning and services.\nVerus is a 100% fairly launched, no-ICO, no-pre-mine community project and introduces a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Power, a 50% proof of work / 50% proof of stake algorithm, which solves theoretical weaknesses in other PoS systems and is provably immune to 51% hash attacks, making Verus one of, if not the most double-spend resistant public blockchain(s) running.\nWith its groundbreaking consensus protocol, Verus also uses a unique hash algorithm, VerusHash 2.0, a quantum secure hash algorithm that is near-equally mineable on",
