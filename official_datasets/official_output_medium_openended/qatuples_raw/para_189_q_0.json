    "What steps has the Verus community taken to ensure the security of their Discord server, and how can users verify the authenticity of messages and files using VerusID?",
    "The Verus community has taken steps to harden their Discord server security to prevent future attacks. They have also explored ways to leverage VerusID to enhance security in meaningful ways. Specifically, they are looking for people with experience in writing Discord bots and securing servers to help with this effort.\n\nIn addition, the Verus community has developed a way to verify the authenticity of messages and files using VerusID. This is done by signing the message or file with a unique signature that can be verified on any Verus node or lite mode API. Users can copy the message or file, enter the ID and signature, and check if the signature is valid. This ensures that the message or file has not been tampered with and is indeed from the claimed sender.\n\nThe Verus website also provides an interface to verify signed files, messages, and hashes, making it easy for users to check the authenticity of messages and files. This feature is an example of how VerusID can be used to provide an additional layer of security and trust in online communications.",
    " we still haven\u2019t found a more suitable engagement platform for the way the community works, a number of people have worked to create and secure a new community Discord Server, and we welcome all Verus Community members and well meaning interested people to join.\nThough we are still hoping to have a conversation with Discord about the hack and how they could improve their security to prevent this for all of their user communities in the future, we have taken steps independently to harden the Verus Discord community in a way that would prevent such an attack in the future, even if the link click session hijack exploit is not resolved. We also have even better security thoughts for the future around leveraging VerusID in easy, meaningful ways. If you have experience writing Discord bots and especially secure servers, please get in touch.
