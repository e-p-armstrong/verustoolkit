    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    How does the Bridge.vETH currency work on the Verus blockchain, and what benefits
    does it provide to users?


    **ANSWER:**

    The Bridge.vETH currency is a dynamic supply currency that plays a crucial role
    in bridging assets between different blockchains on the Verus ecosystem. Here''s
    how it works and the benefits it provides to users:


    **Dynamic Supply:** The supply of Bridge.vETH is dynamic, meaning it can change
    based on the number of conversions happening on the platform. When users convert
    their assets from VRSC, vETH, DAI.vETH, or MKR.vETH to Bridge.vETH, new Bridge.vETH
    tokens are minted. Conversely, when users convert out of Bridge.vETH, tokens are
    burned, reducing the supply.


    **Cross-Chain Fees:** One of the significant benefits of using Bridge.vETH is
    that cross-chain fees are subsidized. When users move their ETH, DAI, and MKR
    to the Verus blockchain before the bridge is launched, around 5000 VRSC is used
    to subsidize the fees on the Verus side. Any remaining VRSC is put into reserves
    once the bridge currency is launched.


    **MEV-Resistance:** Verus DeFi is MEV-resistant, meaning there is no front-running
    or back-running since all conversions are simultaneously solved within a block.
    This ensures a secure and fair conversion process for users.


    **Conversion Flexibility:** After the bridge currency is launched, users can convert
    in any direction, making it easy to move assets between different blockchains.


    **Fee Accrual:** The bridge currency accrues fees from cross-chain functions,
    conversions, and .vETH VerusID registrations, making it more valuable with increased
    usage.


    **DAI Savings Rate:** DAI holders benefit from a 5% interest rate (subject to
    change by MakerDAO) when holding DAI in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. This
    savings rate is passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH.


    **Use Cases:** The Bridge.vETH currency enables several use cases, including:


    1. Converting into any direction after the currency is launched and out of preconversion
    mode.

    2. Exporting launched currencies on Verus as an ERC-20.

    3. Launching currencies on Verus that are 1:1 mapped to any ERC-20.

    4. Sending currencies, tokens, and liquidity pools cross-chain.

    5. Sending ERC-721 & ERC-1155 NFTs to Verus and exporting tokenized ID currencies.


    Overall, the Bridge.vETH currency provides a seamless and cost-effective way to
    bridge assets between different blockchains on the Verus ecosystem, making it
    an attractive solution for users looking to move assets across chains.'
