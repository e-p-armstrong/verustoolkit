    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    What are the basics of staking on the Verus network, and how does the Proof-of-Power
    (PoP) consensus mechanism work to secure the network and reward stakers?


    **ANSWER:**

    Staking on the Verus network is a straightforward process that allows users to
    earn rewards while maintaining full control over their Verus coins. Unlike some
    other staking systems, Verus does not lock up or restrict access to staked coins
    in any way. To start staking, users simply need to enable staking in their wallet,
    and their Verus coins will remain accessible and available for spending at all
    times.


    Verus uses a unique consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Power (PoP), which is
    a hybrid of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This means that the
    network is secured and transactions are processed through a combination of mining
    and staking. Half of the blocks on the Verus network are mined using VerusHash,
    while the other half are "minted" through staking. This hybrid approach provides
    added security to the network, as attackers would need to control both a significant
    portion of the mining hash rate and a large amount of Verus coins to launch a
    successful attack.


    Every block on the Verus network has a chance of being won by staking, and over
    time, it averages out that half of the blocks are solved by mining and half by
    staking. The average block time on Verus is 1 minute, and if a user stakes a block,
    they will receive the block reward and any transaction fees paid by users to have
    their transactions processed. The block reward is proportional to the amount of
    Verus being staked, and there is no minimum amount of Verus required to stake.
    Any funds kept in a transparent address or a VerusID that have been there for
    at least 150 blocks (about 150 minutes) may be used to stake.


    To stake, users must have their wallet running and connected to the internet.
    The chances of staking and receiving a block reward for any given block are proportional
    to the amount of Verus being staked. This means that users with larger amounts
    of Verus staked have a higher chance of winning a block reward, but even users
    with smaller amounts of Verus can participate in staking and earn rewards.'
