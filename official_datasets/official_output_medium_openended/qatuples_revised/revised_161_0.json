    "How do fractional currencies work in the Verus ecosystem, and what are the implications of different backing percentages on the price vs supply curve? Additionally, how can users convert between currencies using fractional currencies?",
    "In the Verus ecosystem, users can create fractional currencies that are either 100% backed by a reserve currency or partially backed by a fraction between 5% and 95%. The fraction of backing is determined by market forces before the currency is launched. The level of backing affects the price vs supply curve of the fractional currency, with higher backing percentages resulting in a different curve.\n\nFractional currencies have adaptive supplies, which means that their supply adjusts according to market demand. The backing percentage of a fractional currency determines the relationship between its price and supply. For example, a currency backed by 10% of its reserves will have a different price vs supply curve than one backed by 50% or 100%.\n\nIn addition to converting between a fractional currency and its reserve currencies, users can also convert between different reserve currencies using a fractional currency as an intermediate step. This is known as converting through the fractional currency. For instance, if a user owns VRSC and wants to convert it to ETH, they can do so through a fractional currency like NewCurrency, which has both VRSC and ETH in its reserves. The Verus protocol will search for the best price for the conversion and facilitate the transaction.\n\nThe possibility of converting in every direction using fractional currencies provides users with greater flexibility and options for managing their assets in the Verus ecosystem.",
    "backed 100%. In the Verus ecosystem, we can have fractional currencies that are partially, fractionally, backed by a number between 5 and 95%, see image 5.\nImage 5: Two examples of fractional currencies that are partially backed by its reserves\nHow one creates 100% backed or partially backed fractional currencies differs. A user can create a currency and define that the currency is 100% backed. A user can not define the fraction between 5 and 95%. The number of backing by a fractional currency is dependent upon market forces before the currency is launched.\nOne can ask, what is the consequence that a currency is backed by 10, 50, 80 or 100%? The difference is the curve of price vs supply. And remember, the fractional currencies have adaptive supplies. See image 6 for a simplified illustration.\nImage 6: Different backing percentage means different price vs supply curve\nConverting From Reserve to Reserve\nWe have explained how one can always convert to a fractional currency with its reserve currencies. Or back to a reserve currency with the fractional currency. In the Verus ecosystem there is another way to convert currencies.\nWe call this converting through the fractional currency. One doesn\u2019t acquire the fractional currency, but converts through the fractional currency to a reserve currency. To simplify: one converts one reserve currency to another reserve currency. See image 7 for the different conversion possibilities within our NewCurrency example. Remember that all the currencies (fractional & reserves) have a value relative to each other.\nImage 7: Possibility to convert in every direction\nFor example, if one owns VRSC, they can convert it to ETH through NewCurrency. In the Verus DeFi ecosystem, if one wants to convert VRSC to ETH, the protocol searches through all the fractional currencies with both VRSC and ETH in its reserves, presenting you the best price for c",
