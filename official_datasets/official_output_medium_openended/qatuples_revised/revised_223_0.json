    "How do Verus's basket currencies and simple token currencies work, and what benefits do they offer?",
    "Verus offers two types of currencies: basket currencies and simple token currencies. Each has its own unique characteristics and benefits.\n\n**Basket Currencies:**\nBasket currencies are a type of currency that is backed by a reserve of other currencies. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to the reserves it holds and the reserve ratio. The reserve ratio determines how volatile the currency is when converting into or out of the basket currency. A lower reserve ratio means the currency is more volatile.\n\nThe owner of the root ID of a basket currency has control over the minting and burning of currencies, which affects the reserve ratio. Anyone can burn the currency, but only the owner can mint new currencies or burn them to raise the reserve ratio.\n\nOne of the key benefits of basket currencies is their low conversion fees. Converting to and from a basket currency costs only 0.025%, while converting from reserve to reserve currency costs 0.05%. These fees go directly to the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol or are accrued into the reserves, making the basket currency more valuable.\n\nAnother advantage of basket currencies is that they are MEV-free, meaning that all currency conversions are solved simultaneously inside a block, giving all participants the same price. This eliminates the problems associated with EVM-like account-based systems.\n\n**Simple Token Currencies:**\nSimple token currencies, on the other hand, are currencies without reserves. While they may not be as exciting as basket currencies, they still offer significant value. They can be customized with various parameters, sub-IDs, and decentralized crowdfunding mechanisms, making them suitable for a wide range of use cases.\n\nIn summary, Verus's basket currencies and simple token currencies offer a high degree of flexibility, customization, and value creation opportunities. Anyone can launch these currencies without requiring programming knowledge, making them accessible to a broad range of users.",
    "ratio, or the weight. The lower the reserve ratio, the more volatile the currency is when people are converting into or out of the basket currency. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to what is in the reserves and what the reserve ratio is.\nWhen a centralized version of this currency is created, the owner of the rootID can mint currencies into existence, while automatically lowering the reserve ratio. Or they can burn currencies and automatically raise the reserve ratio. Anyone can also just burn the currency at will without raising the reserve ratio.\nThe conversion fees are incredibly low, 0.025% when converting to and from a basket currency, and 0.05% when converting from reserve to reserve currency. These fees go directly to the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, and/or they are accrued into the reserves making the basket currency worth more.\nBecause all currency conversions are solved simultaneously inside a block, giving all participants the same price, the protocol is MEV-free. The protocol doesn\u2019t have any of the problems EVM-like account-based systems have. Verus DeFi is fair, cheap and has no rent-seekers.\nEvery(!) currency on the Verus network (also mapped ERC-20s!), can be used as reserves for basket currencies. As you might start to understand now \u2014 basket currencies are unique currencies that can not be found anywhere else and offer an enormous amount of opportunities for value creation. And anyone can launch them without needing any programming knowledge!\nSimple Token Currencies\nSimple token currencies are just currencies without any reserves. They are not as exciting as the basket currencies, yet still offer much value. With all the parameters that can be added, subIDs created and decentralized crowdfund mechanism, these currencies can support a lot of use cases that are difficult to do with alternative protocols.
