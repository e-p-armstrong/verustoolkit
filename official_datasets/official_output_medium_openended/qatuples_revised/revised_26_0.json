    "What is Switch, and how does it work?",
    "Switch is a decentralized currency on the Verus blockchain, fully backed by its reserves. It allows for low-cost, MEV-resistant DeFi conversions between various stablecoins, including VRSC, DAI, USDC, and EURC, with a maximum fee of 0.05%.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* Switch's initial supply is 20,000 Switch, and its reserves are weighted as follows: VRSC (16%), DAI (21%), USDC (21%), and EURC (42%).\n* This means that the amount of Switch received when converting from one of these stablecoins depends on the weight of that stablecoin in the reserves. For example, converting EURC to Switch will result in more Switch than converting VRSC to Switch.\n* Switch is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) that allows for conversions between any of the reserves, making it a convenient and cost-effective way to exchange between different stablecoins.\n* When someone converts to Switch, the conversion fees are split: 50% goes to the Switch reserves, increasing the value of Switch, and the other 50% goes to the miners and stakers of Verus.\n* There is a risk to holding Switch, as USDC and EURC are distributed by the centralized company Circle.\n* The supply of Switch is dynamic, meaning it can increase or decrease based on conversions to and from the reserves. When someone converts to Switch, new Switch is minted, and when someone converts back to the reserves, Switch is burned.\n\nOverall, Switch provides a decentralized and efficient way to convert between different stablecoins, with low fees and a dynamic supply.",

Or type in /switch in the #trading channel in the community Discord.\n\ud83d\udcda Learn in this article how to convert the stables with each other, and how to convert to and from Switch. Also you learn how to bridge EURC or USDC to the Verus network.\nWhat is Switch?\nSwitch is a decentralized currency on the Verus blockchain. It is fully (100%) backed by its reserves. Its initial supply is 20,000 Switch.\nIts reserves are weighted as follows: VRSC (16%), DAI DAI.vETH (21%), USDC vUSDC.vETH (21%) & EURC EURC.vETH (42%). What does this mean? E.g. when you put EURC in the reserves you get more Switch after preconversion than when you put VRSC in.\nUse Switch to convert between any of the reserves for a max. fee of 0.05%. Switch is a MEV-resistant AMM.

Switch gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETHor EURC.vETH, and get burned when people convert back to the reserves.",
