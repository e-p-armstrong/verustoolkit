    "What are the recommended steps to configure a Digital Ocean Droplet as a Verus staking server, including setting up a new root password, configuring SSH, and creating a new secure user account?",
    "When setting up a Digital Ocean Droplet as a Verus staking server, there are several important steps to follow to ensure security and proper configuration. Here's a detailed guide on how to do it:\n\n**Step 1: Set a New Root Password**\nThe first step is to set a new root password for your Droplet. To do this, log in to your Digital Ocean account and access your Droplet's console. You will be prompted to reset your password, which was emailed to you when you created the Droplet. Choose a highly secure and complex password that you don't use elsewhere.\n\n**Step 2: Configure SSH**\nNext, you need to set up SSH to use your SSH key for logging into your Droplet instead of password authentication. If you're not familiar with this process, you can follow a guide on how to add SSH keys to your Droplet.\n\n**Step 3: Create a New Secure User Account**\nCreate a new user account in your Droplet that will run Verus and serve as your access to the system. This is important because you shouldn't use the root account for access. To create the new user account, use the command `adduser username`, replacing \"username\" with the username you want to use. You'll be prompted to enter a full name and other information, but the only important thing is to set a secure password for this account.\n\n**Giving Sudo Privileges and Testing**\nAfter creating the new user account, give it sudo privileges by running the command `usermod -aG sudo username`. Then, log off the server and test that you can SSH into the Droplet using the new user account. If everything goes well, you'll be able to log in successfully.\n\n**Disabling Root SSH Privilege**\nFinally, to add an extra layer of security, you can disable root SSH privilege. To do this, open the `sshd_config` file as sudo using the command `sudo nano`, and make the necessary changes.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a properly configured Digital Ocean Droplet for use as a Verus staking server. Remember to use secure passwords and follow best practices for SSH configuration to ensure the security of your server.",
    " right. This opens a new console window, which looks just like a terminal window.\nPart Three \u2014 Configure The Droplet\nNow that the droplet is setup and online, you\u2019ll want to configure it for use as your Verus staking server. Following are my recommendations and in my opinion, the best practices.\nStep 1 \u2014 New Root Password\nSet a new root password straight away! To do this, login to your new droplet using the Console from the Management within your Digital Ocean account using the root password emailed to you. Your droplet will prompt you to reset your password (create a new one). Use a highly secure and complex password that you do not use elsewhere.\nStep 2 \u2014 Setup SSH\nNext, setup SSH to use your SSH Key for logging into your Droplet (instead of password authentication). If you don\u2019t know how, follow this guide: How to Add SSH Keys to Your Droplet.\nBefore removing root SSH privilege, follow the next step to create a new account in your Droplet.\nStep 3 \u2014 Setup New Secure User Account\nNext, you need to setup a new user account in the Droplet which will run Verus and be your access to the system, so root is not used for access.\nHere are the steps to create a new user account, give it \u201csudo\u201d privileges, test it and disable root SSH:\nYou\u2019ll create the new user account with: adduser username make sure to change username to the username you want to use for this account. You\u2019ll have prompts for Full Name, etc\u2026but the only important thing is setting the secure password for this account. Make it as secure as your root password!\nAfter the user account is created, give it sudo privileges with: \nusermod -aG sudo username again, replace username with the username you created.\nNext, log off the server and test that you can SSH using the new user account.\nIf it went well, it will login fine and you can now remove root SSH privilege:\n- Open the sshd_config file as sudo to edit:\nsudo nan",
