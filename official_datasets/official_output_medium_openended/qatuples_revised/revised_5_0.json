    "How does the notarization process work in Verus, and what are the key differences between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization?",
    "The notarization process in Verus is a multi-step process that ensures the integrity and security of the blockchain. Here's an overview of how it works:\n\n**Step 1: Earned Notarization**\nA new notarization is earned and entered on the notary chain as an \"accepted\" notarization. This notarization agrees with a prior accepted notarization and includes proof of the agreement. If the prior accepted notarization is not yet confirmed, it may be considered newly confirmed.\n\n**Step 2: Agreement and Signatures**\nOnce an earned notarization has been agreed to by a new earned notarization, notary witnesses sign to signify their agreement with the notarization. This process alternates between PoW and PoS blocks to further decentralize the requirements for agreement. Notary witnesses can disagree with a signature, and no signature is also a valid way to disagree.\n\n**Step 3: Confirmation**\nAfter validators and notary witnesses have agreed, or in the case of auto-notarization, a longer validation period with more agreement has passed, the prior notarization agreed with by a new notarization that has passed all necessary agreement is confirmed. Once confirmed, the blockchain is considered final up to the point of that confirmation and will resist reorganizations to any point behind.\n\n**Notary Confirm Notarization vs Auto-Notarization**\nThe primary difference between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization is the amount and type of evidence required to enter a potentially confirmed notarization. Notary confirm notarization always requires a quorum of signatures from the specified notaries, whereas auto-notarization requires more multi-stage evidence in the face of randomized proof selection, potential fraud proofs, and disagreements. Fully centralized gateways still operate on cryptographic proofs, but they only need notaries to agree on the cryptographic roots in order to consider them true and do not need cryptographic proof to establish the notarization proof root.\n\nIn summary, notarization in Verus is a secure and decentralized process that ensures the integrity of the blockchain. The key differences between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization lie in the amount and type of evidence required to enter a potentially confirmed notarization.",
    ", which are typically present. The new, confirmed, earned notarization is entered on the notary chain as an \u201caccepted\u201d notarization, and is entered as \u201cagreeing\u201d with a prior accepted notarization along with proof of the agreement. If the prior accepted notarization it agrees with is not yet confirmed, then it may be considered newly confirmed.\n2. Once an earned notarization has been agreed to by a new earned notarization, alternating between PoW and PoS blocks to help further decentralized requirements for agreement, and by following all notarization rules, notary witnesses may sign signifying they agree with the notarization as well. Although they can disagree with a signature, no signature is also a valid way to disagree.\n3. After validators and notary witnesses have agreed, or in the case of auto-notarization, a longer validation period with more agreement has passed, the prior notarization agreed with by a new notarization that has passed all necessary agreement, is confirmed. Once that happens, the blockchain is considered final up to the point of that confirmation and will resist reorganizations to any point behind.\nThe primary difference between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization is the amount and type of evidence required to enter a potentially confirmed notarization. Most notably, \u201cnotary confirm\u201d always requires a quorum of signatures from the specified notaries, whereas auto-notarization requires more multi-stage evidence in the face of randomized proof selection, potential fraud proofs and disagreements. Fully centralized gateways still operate on cryptographic proofs, but they only need notaries to agree on the cryptographic roots in order to consider them true and do not need cryptographic proof to establish the notarization proof root.\nOnce a proof root has been established by notarization, this root is used to cryptographically prove bu",
