    "What are the key differences between Verus Smart Transactions and Smart Contracts, and how do they approach application programming and decentralized capabilities?",
    "To understand the differences between Verus Smart Transactions and Smart Contracts, it's essential to look at the application programming model and how each of them works in context.\n\n**Smart Contracts:**\nIn the current Ethereum model, smart contracts are executable programs that run on a blockchain where the only currency with enforced accounting is ETH. To create a token, account abstraction, or any other form of currency or identity-like structure (such as NFTs or liquidity pools), developers write a contract according to accepted conventions. However, there are no actual checks to ensure that the contract follows math accuracy, interface adherence, or accounting rules. These contracts, similar to stored procedures in a database, carry the database schema and interface, and their differentiation lies in their implementation of accepted conventions.\n\nThe Ethereum network achieves consensus by ensuring that the shared, serialized, worldwide computer (EVM) executes its low-level instructions accurately, without accounting for currencies, exchanges, efficient IDs, zk-privacy, and other features. The currencies running above the single native security currency (ETH) operate by arbitrary rules, which are often opaque or contain inconsistencies.\n\n**Verus Smart Transactions:**\nIn contrast, Verus Smart Transactions are designed to be much easier to use in practice to achieve most capabilities in a decentralized fashion. They do not require writing executable programs or contracts, and instead, focus on enabling decentralized capabilities through a more straightforward and secure approach. Verus Smart Transactions are built to ensure accuracy, interface adherence, and accounting rules, providing a more reliable and efficient way to achieve decentralized applications.\n\nWhile there is no 1:1 correlation between smart transactions and smart contracts, Verus Smart Transactions offer a more practical and user-friendly way to achieve decentralized capabilities, making them a more attractive option for developers and users alike.",

To launch, or materialize a token, an account abstraction, or any other form of currency or identity-like structure (NFTs, liquidity pools, etc), you write an executable program/contract, according to accepted conventions, but with no actual checks that you follow any form of math accuracy, interface adherence, or accounting rules whatsoever.\nThe differentiation of these contracts, which are akin to stored procedures in a database, but carry with them the DB schema as well as the interface, is in the way they enable differences of implementation of those accepted conventions.\nConsensus across all of Ethereum is applied to ensuring that the shared, serialized, worldwide computer that is the EVM executes its low level instructions accurately, with no accounting of currencies, exchanges, enablement of efficient, actual IDs, zk-privacy, etc. The currencies that run above the single native security currency, run by arbitrary rules, often opaque or containin",
