    "How do I start solo mining on Verus, and what are some important security considerations I should keep in mind when doing so?",
    "To start solo mining on Verus, you can follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Sync the Chain**\nFirst, you need to wait for the Verus chain to sync on your computer. You can see the progress of the sync in the blue loading bar, which will show a percentage complete. Once the sync is complete, you'll see a Mining button appear below \"Transactions History\".\n\n**Step 2: Configure Mining**\nExpand the Mining button and set the number of CPU threads you want to use for solo mining. Then, click \"Start mining\" to begin the mining process.\n\n**Step 3: Optional - Start Staking**\nIf you have a VRSC balance, you can also choose to start staking. However, be careful not to activate staking on multiple solo mining computers using the same wallet.dat file, as this can cause you to lose staked rewards. Only activate staking once per wallet, or use a separate wallet for each solo mining computer.\n\n**Step 4: Monitor Your Mining Activity**\nYou can view your hash rate and stop the miner at any time using the buttons in Agama. Note that Verus Agama must remain open and online to actively mine or stake.\n\n**Security Considerations**\nWhen solo mining on Verus, it's essential to keep your wallet.dat file secure and backed up regularly. This file is located in a hidden VRSC folder on your computer, and its location varies depending on your operating system. Make sure to keep your solo miner secure at all times, and avoid using a computer that is prone to malware or other security issues for mining.",
    "Step 2\nWait for the chain to sync (you\u2019ll see a percentage in the blue loading bar) to 100%. Once synced up, a Mining button will appear just below \u201cTransactions History\u201d. Expand it and set the number of CPU threads you want to Solo mine with, then click \u201cStart mining\u201d:Step 3 (optional)\nYou can also click \u201cStart Staking\u201d if you\u2019d like to stake any VRSC balance. Keep in mind that if you make a copy of your wallet.dat file and use it on multiple Solo mining computers, you should only activate Staking on ONE of these iterations. If every Solo miner uses it\u2019s own, individual wallet, you can stake on each.\nBottom line: Only activate Staking ONCE PER WALLET or you will risk losing staked rewards, because Verus has solved the Nothing at Stake problem at the blockchain level, using Stake Guard and the decentralization of the network.

You can view your hash rate and stop the miner at any time using the buttons in Agama:\nScreenshot \u201cslightly\u201d modified for effect!\nNOTE: Verus Agama MUST REMAIN OPEN AND ONLINE to actively mine or stake\nStep 5\nVerus (Native Agama and CLI) creates a wallet.dat which is located in a hidden VRSC folder. This file should be kept SECURE and you should regularly BACK IT UP.\nThe wallet.dat file for VRSC is located in the following locations for various OS\u2019s:\nOn Windows: %AppData%\\Komodo\\VRSC \nOn Mac: ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Komodo/VRSC \nOn Linux: ~/.komodo/VRSC\nThis means your solo miner should be kept secure at all times. If you have a lot of trouble with managing your browsing activity, getting malware often, etc., you should NOT use that computer to mine. Make sure your mining rig is password ",
