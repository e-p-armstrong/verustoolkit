Once added, you can use Verus Mobile, Verus Desktop, or MetaMask with the bridge website to bridge and preconvert these tokens to Switch, a MEV-resistant AMM (Automated Market Maker) on the Verus blockchain.\n\nThe benefits of using Verus for these conversions include:\n\n* Low transaction fees: Verus scales to everyone worldwide and auto-converts payments from your favorite currency for always low transaction fees.\n* 0.05% conversion fee: Verus charges a small conversion fee of 0.05% for converting between currencies.\n* Decentralized and trustless: The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is non-custodial and trustless, meaning that you maintain control of your assets throughout the conversion process.\n* MEV-resistant AMM: Switch, the MEV-resistant AMM on the Verus blockchain, ensures that conversions are fair and resistant to manipulation.\n\nAdditionally, Verus Pay allows you to use your converted currencies to make everyday purchases, such as buying coffee, by scanning a QR code.
