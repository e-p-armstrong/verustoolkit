    "What are some of the key parameters that can be used when defining currencies in Verus, and how do they affect the behavior of the currency?",
    "When defining currencies in Verus, there are several parameters that can be used to customize the behavior of the currency. Some of these parameters include:\n\n1. **\"startblock\"**: This parameter is used to define the block height when the currency is launched. When omitted, it defaults to a 20-block preconversion time frame before the currency is launched. The preconversion time frame is always at least 20 blocks and cannot be less.\n\n2. **\"endblock\"**: This parameter is used to signal the end of a centralized currency's lifespan, at which point it becomes decentralized. It has no effect on basket currencies.\n\n3. **\"idregistrationfees\"**: This parameter is used to change the costs of registering subIDs under the rootID. The default registration fee is 100. When the currency is decentralized, the fees are burned, and when it's centralized, the fees go to the rootID.\n\n4. **\"idreferrallevels\"**: This parameter is used to change the levels of referrals used when registering subIDs. The default is 3 levels.\n\n5. **\"nativecurrencyid\"**: This parameter is used for mapped ERC-20 tokens and includes the Ethereum contract address for the ERC-20.\n\n6. **\"options\":8**: This parameter is used to enable discounts when using referrals.\n\nThese parameters can be combined in various ways to create powerful currencies and tokens that suit different use cases. The Verus community is always available to help with defining and launching currencies.",
    " BusinessBrand and DiscountBrand.\n\u201cstartblock\u201d\nUse this parameter to define the block height when the currency is launched. There is a preconversion time frame before the currency is launched. When omitting this parameter it uses a 20 block preconversion time frame before the currency is launched.\nThe preconversion time frame is always 20 blocks, this can not be less.\n\u201cendblock\u201d\nEndblock can not be defined on basket currencies. It does nothing. It could be set as a signal to software that might use the basket currency.\nIt can be set on centralized (proofprotcol:2) simple token currencies. When the endblock is reached, it turns the centralized currency into a decentralized one.\n\u201cidregistrationfees\u201d\nUse this parameter to change the costs of registering subIDs under the rootID. The default registration fee is 100.\nWhen it\u2019s a decentralized currency the fees are burned, when it\u2019s centralized the fees go to the rootID.\nTo enable discounts when using referrals, add \"options\":8 to the currency definition.\n\u201cidreferrallevels\u201d\nUse this parameter to change the levels of referrals used when registering subIDs. The default is 3 levels.\n\u201cnativecurrencyid\u201d\nUse this parameter for mapped ERC-20 tokens. The parameter includes the Ethereum contract address for the ERC-20. Read here for more information.\nThese were all the parameters to use when defining currencies. There are many, and combining them in the right ways make powerful currencies and tokens. The community is always ready to help when defining and launching currencies for your use cases! Please go to Discord and ask away.\nThe next chapter explains how to exactly launch these currencies.\nHow to Launch the Currencies\nLaunching these currencies is quite easy. Launch with the command-line interface, or Verus Desktop for Windows, Linux or macOS. Download here.\nIn the chapter before many examples of currency definitions are given. ",
