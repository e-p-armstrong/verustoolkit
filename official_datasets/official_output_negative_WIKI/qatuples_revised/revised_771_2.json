    "When creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent, do I need to specify a referrer address?",
    "No, that's not correct. You can leave the referrer field blank by using quotes `\"\"`. The `registernamecommitment` command allows this, and an example is specifying a parent currency (vrsc-btc) without a referrer.",

We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration",
