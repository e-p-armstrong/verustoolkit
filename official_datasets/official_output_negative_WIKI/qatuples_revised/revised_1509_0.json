    "Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag Verus software as malware?",
    "The antivirus software Avast and Kaspersky do not flag Verus software as malware. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software includes mining capabilities that could be exploited by third parties to use your PC for mining without your consent. This is not a malware detection, but rather a warning about the potential risks associated with mining software.",
