    "Is it normal to encounter the error message `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` or `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory` when running `./verusd` on a Linux distro, because all dependencies are installed by default?",
    "No, it's not normal to encounter this error message because all dependencies are installed by default. In fact, the error occurs because not all dependencies may be installed by default, and you need to install the libgomp1 and zlib1g-dev libraries to fix the issue.",
