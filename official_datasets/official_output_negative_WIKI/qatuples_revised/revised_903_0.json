    "How do I access the Ethereum bridge on the mainnet?",
    "The Ethereum bridge is not currently available on the mainnet. It is expected to be available on the new Verus testnet within the next day or two, and can be accessed at https://ethtest.verus.services. To use the bridge, you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.",
    "## Ethereum Bridge\nAlthough its deployment has been delayed, we expect the Ethereum bridge to be brought back up on the new Verus testnet within the next day or two. When it is up, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services, and use your metamask to convert or send cross-chain to the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the #pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for mainnet release in the next couple weeks and start building your vision today!## Verus PBaaS and DeFi RC5 - BUG BOUNTIES\nAt this time, we are not aware of any bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross chain protocols on this version of testnet. We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all of the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release. While we don\u2019t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people (7 still unclaimed) who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended. If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.",
