    "How do I manually calculate the exact date when an immature block will mature, without using any scripts or automation tools?",
    "Unfortunately, it's not possible to manually calculate the exact date when an immature block will mature without using any scripts or automation tools. The provided script is necessary to automate the calculation, as it takes into account the varying number of blocks per day (which is not always exactly 1440) to estimate the date. Without the script, you would need to constantly monitor the blockchain and perform complex calculations to estimate the maturity date.",
    "# How do I know when an immature block will \"unlock\" (mature)?\n\nYou can use the following scripts to automate it (prints, for each block, how many blocks remaining and the estimated date).\nKeep in mind that the actual number of blocks per day is not always exactly 1440. It varies and the estimated dates may change slightly over time. Below you will find the Linux script that will calculate the extimated time for you:\n\n## Script:\n\n```bash\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#Config\nverus_path=\"/XXXX/verus-cli/\"\nverus_cli=\"verus\"\n\nget_transactions=( $($verus_path$verus_cli listtransactions \"\" 1000 0|grep blockstomaturity|sed 's/.e: //;s/,//g'|awk '{ print $2 }'|sort -n) )\ncur_block=( $($verus_path$verus_cli getmininginfo|grep blocks\":|sed 's/.e: //;s/,//g'|awk '{ print $2 }') )\narr_idx=\"0\"\n\nfor i in \"${get_transactions[@]}\"\ndo\n    days_to_mature=$(( ($i )/1440 ))\n    mature_to_date=$(date +\"%m-%d-%Y\" -d \"+$days_to_mature days\")\n    echo \"\"Block #\" $arr_idx \"will mature in approximately\"$days_to_mature \"days\" \"(\" $mature_to_date \")\" \"\n    ((arr_idx++))\ndone\n```\n\nYou'll need to enter the correct path to your verus directory and you will need to have the verus daemon running in order to sucessfully run this script.\n\n(submitted by @TexWiller, edited by @bigtom, reviewed by @Englal)\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-04-24.",
