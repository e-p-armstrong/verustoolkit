    "Can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have a market with only one currency, such as BTC?",
    "No, the `getcurrencyconverters` API requires at least two currencies to be specified, such as BTC and ETH. It returns all currencies that have markets with both of the specified currencies at or above the liquidity threshold.",
    "ueries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n  ```\n  Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
