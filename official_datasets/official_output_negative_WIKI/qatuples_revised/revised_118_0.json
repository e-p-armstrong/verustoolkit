    "When defining a new currency, why is it recommended to set the `proofprotocol` to 1, which is PROOF_WORK?",
    "Actually, when defining a new currency, it's not recommended to set the `proofprotocol` to 1, which is PROOF_WORK. In the given example, `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
