    "How do I list all currencies that have a market with exactly one reserve currency using the Verus command-line tool?",
    "The question is based on a flawed premise. The `getcurrencyconverters` command is used to list all currencies that have markets at or above a certain liquidity threshold, not to list currencies with a specific number of reserve currencies. To list currencies that have markets with both BTC and ETH, you can use the command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have markets with both BTC and ETH.",
    "o, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nWill return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
