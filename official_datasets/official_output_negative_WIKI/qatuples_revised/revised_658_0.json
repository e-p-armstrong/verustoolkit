    "# Welcome to Verus## The Future Is NowHere is a collection of information meant to span several platforms and services in order to keep all of us more informed on what\u2019s happening across the growing, world-wide community. It will also help to connect us, allowing us to discuss what\u2019s being worked on, what can be done to help and as a way to look ahead in a more involved way.Verus, latin for \u201cTrue\u201d, combines all of the features we believe are important in a cryptocurrency, and provides a foundation for future development. Verus is a fork of Zcash and Komodo that leverages the Komodo platform, and we appreciate the contributions and support from those teams as well as the Bitcoin developers that created a foundation for us to launch new capabilities **in a system that supports Bitcoin and Zcash compatible transaction types as well as Komodo cross chain swaps** and dPoW security enhancements.1.

We\u2019ve all had them and we know quite well that when unscrupulous projects abuse words like decentralization, interoperability, or protocol level solutions, it can have a *\u201cboy who cried wolf\u201d* effect.",
