    "Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky consider the Verus software to be a threat?",
    "Actually, Avast and Kaspersky do not consider the Verus software to be a threat. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is a mining application that could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and you can verify the authenticity of the download by checking the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, which are included in a txt file with each download.",
