    "Why do I need to install the libgomp2 and zlib2g-dev libraries to fix the error message `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` or `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory` when running `./verusd` on a Linux distro?",
    "The libraries you need to install to fix the error are actually libgomp1 and zlib1g-dev, not libgomp2 and zlib2g-dev. The correct command to run is `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.",
