    "To reset your testnet, do you need to delete the entire Verus directory, including the executable files?",
    "No, to reset your testnet, you only need to delete specific directories, which vary depending on your operating system. On Linux, you need to delete `~/.Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`. On Mac OS, you need to delete `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`. On Windows 10, you need to delete `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\VRSC\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`. You don't need to delete the entire Verus directory, including the executable files.",
