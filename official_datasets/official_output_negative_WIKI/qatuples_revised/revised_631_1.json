    "Are Verus digital signatures limited to single public/private key pairs, just like Bitcoin?",
    "No, Verus digital signatures are not limited to single public/private key pairs like Bitcoin. Verus ID enables decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft. This means that Verus digital signatures offer more advanced capabilities than just a single public/private key pair.",
    "# Worldwide Verifiable Digital Signatures for All!Verus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer the first worldwide verifiable, decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft.Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables. It is also the foundation upon which many new applications and additional capabilities can be built.",
