    "Can you explain why VerusIDs cannot be used to create Ethereum NFT mapped currencies?",
    "Actually, VerusIDs can be used to create Ethereum NFT mapped currencies. These currencies enable NFTs, such as Cryptopunks or Ethrocks, to not only be sent to Verus, but also to be permanently upleveled with ID powers, being cryptographically bound as an ID's permanent control token that can be sent to any chain or to Ethereum and back.",
    "th or IDs with root names on the Verus blockchain can be used to create Ethereum NFT mapped currencies, which enable a Cryptopunk, Ethrock, or whatever other NFT you\u2019d like to not only be sent to Verus, held on a revocable/recoverable ID, and also permanently upleveled with ID powers, being cryptographically bound as an ID\u2019s permanent control token that can be sent to any chain or to Ethereum and back.\n This unique Verus-only technology and VerusIDs enable new models of complex, atomic and fully decentralized transactions. By using exported IDs across any number of networks and an ID control token, ownership of an unlimited array of assets across an unlimited number of networks can for the first time ever, have ownership transferred in one transaction.\n- While NFT mapped tokens are supported on the RC2 PBaaS protocol, they have not yet been implemented in the Ethereum contracts. You will not be able to send NFTs from Ethereum to Verus or PBaaS chains until that work is complete, which we do not expect to take a great deal of time.\n- Liquidity currencies now support new methods to burn currency with the following results:\n - `burnweight` - available to centralized currencies only and enables burning the primary currency to raise the reserve ratio weights of all reserves.\n - `burn` for reserve currencies - in prior releases, burn was only used for primary currencies and would reduce the supply of a currency relative to its reserves, increasing the on-chain value of the primary currency. In v0.9.4, you can now also \u201cburn\u201d reserve currencies in a liquidity basket currency, which simply donates that amount of reserve into the currency\u2019s reserves without taking any new supply in exchange. This is available to decentralized or centralized currencies.",
