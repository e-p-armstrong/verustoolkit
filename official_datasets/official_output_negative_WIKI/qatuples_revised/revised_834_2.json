    "Can I fix the error message `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` or `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory` by reinstalling `./verusd`?",
    "No, reinstalling `./verusd` will not fix the error message. The error is caused by missing dependencies, specifically libgomp1 and zlib1g-dev, which need to be installed separately using `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.",
    "# error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory\n# error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory\n\nWhen running `./verusd` on a Linux distro (eg Debian or Devuan), not all dependencies may be installed by default, resulting in the errormessage `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` or `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory`.\n\nTo solve this you need to install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries:\n`sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`\n\nSolution supplied by: Oink.vrsc@\n\nNote: revision date 2021-12-01.",
