    "Is it true that the Verus software is a virus or malware?",
    "No, the Verus software is not a virus or malware. Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), but this is because the software includes mining capabilities, which may be used by third parties to exploit users' PCs. The software itself is not malicious and is intended for testing and development purposes.",

THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED FOR USE ON MAINNET.***The Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. Sending currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies is as easy as sending a cryptocurrency in less advanced systems today, except that the new Verus protocol enables you to include another blockchain as part of your destination and convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price along the way. All conversions are fully decentralized, require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network, and calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.",
