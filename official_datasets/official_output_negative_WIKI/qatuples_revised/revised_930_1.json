    "Can I use `getchaintips` to get the statistics about the total number and rate of transactions in the chain?",
    "No, `getchaintips` is not used to get statistics about transactions. It's actually used to get information about the chain tips, including the height, hash, branch length, and status of each tip. If you want to get statistics about transactions, you should use the `getchaintxstats` method instead.",
    "#### Result:\n```json\n[\n {\n  \"height\": xxxx,     (numeric) height of the chain tip\n  \"hash\": \"xxxx\",     (string) block hash of the tip\n  \"branchlen\": 0     (numeric) zero for main chain\n  \"status\": \"active\"   (string) \"active\" for the main chain\n },\n {\n  \"height\": xxxx,\n  \"hash\": \"xxxx\",\n  \"branchlen\": 1     (numeric) length of branch connecting the tip to the main chain\n  \"status\": \"xxxx\"    (string) status of the chain (active, valid-fork, valid-headers, headers-only, invalid)\n }\n]\n```\nPossible values for status:\n1. \"invalid\"        This branch contains at least one invalid block\n2. \"headers-only\"     Not all blocks for this branch are available, but the headers are valid\n3. \"valid-headers\"     All blocks are available for this branch, but they were never fully validated\n4. \"valid-fork\"      This branch is not part of the active chain, but is fully validated\n5. \"active\"        This is the tip of the active main chain, which is certainly validExamples:\n```bash\n> verus getchaintips\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getchaintips\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```### `getchaintxstats`Compute statistics about the total number and rate of transactions in the chain.#### Arguments:\n1. nblocks  (numeric, optional) Number of blocks in averaging window.\n2. blockhash (string, optional) The hash of the block which ends the window.",
