    "Can anyone mint new coins in \"mycoin\" after it's been defined?",
    "No, only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins in \"mycoin\" after it's been defined. This is because the `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID, giving the controller of the chain ID the ability to mint new coins.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
