    "Is mining VRSC with Verushash only profitable with a high-end GPU?",
    "No, mining VRSC with Verushash is not only profitable with a high-end GPU. In fact, a fairly modern CPU with AES and AVX instructions can be one of the most profitable ways to mine VRSC. GPUs can also be used, but they will perform worse than modern CPUs. Additionally, FPGAs can be used, and some stronger ones can outperform CPUs, although they require a lot of power to do so.",
    "# Is mining profitable?\n#### Necessary files:\nLink 1: [Verush Hashrates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrSYJDV0Mjj3X-myMC3aQDGkcipivxHsD7ZxJ3r5f_A/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Answer:\nMining VRSC with Verushash is at this time one of the most profitable coins to mine with your CPU.\nIf you want to know how profitable it is, you need to know a few important details about your own conditions.\n1. What hardware will I use to mine with?\n 1. CPU - If that is a fairly modern CPU with AES and AVX instructions built in.\n This will be true if your processor is produced in 2013 or later. For processors between 2008 and 2012 you need to check the specifications.\n Older processors can still mine, but they will not perform well.\n 2. GPU - It is possible to mine with fairly modern Nvidia GPU's, but since Verushash uses specific functions from the\n mentioned AES and AVX instruction sets, they will perform better than old CPUs, but worse than modern CPUs.\n 3. FPGA - Many of these semi-specialized machines can be reprogrammed to mine VRSC. They don't have the same power per processor as a CPU, but they often have multiple processors running parrallel. The stronger ones can outperform a CPU easily, but need a lot of power to do so.\n\n2. What is my energy price?\n\n3. Do I use existing hardware or do I buy?\n\nIf you know the answer to the hardware, you can look op a comparable one in the Spreadsheat from Link 1, to give you an\nidea of the performance.\n\nIf you know your energy price also, you can [calculate](#!faq-allos/faq-allos02_average_time_to_find_a_block_manual_calculation.md) an estimation of how much your hardware can earn you at this moment.\n\nIf you have to get new hardware just to mine, think about it for a moment: would you have bought new hardware anyway? If so,\nyou can use this information to get an idea what kind of hardware you want to buy.\n\nCreated by Oink.vrsc@",
