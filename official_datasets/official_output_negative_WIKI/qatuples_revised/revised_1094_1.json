    "What is the purpose of the `definecurrency` command?",
    "The `definecurrency` command is used to define a blockchain currency, either as an independent blockchain or as a token on this blockchain. It does not do something entirely unrelated, like managing user accounts or setting up network connections.",
    "#### Arguments:\n```\n1. \"hexdata\"           (string, required) the hex-encoded, complete, unsolved block data to add. nTime, and nSolution are replaced.\n2. \"name\"            (string, required) chain name symbol\n3. \"rpchost\"           (string, required) host address for RPC connection\n4. \"rpcport\"           (int,  required) port address for RPC connection\n5. \"userpass\"          (string, required) credentials for login to RPC\n```\n#### Result:\n```\n\"deserialize-invalid\" - block could not be deserialized and was rejected as invalid\n\"blocksfull\"     - block did not exceed others in estimated ROI, and there was no room for an additional merge mined block\n```\nExamples:\n```bash\n> verus addmergedblock \"hexdata\" '{\"currencyid\" : \"hexstring\", \"rpchost\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"rpcport\" : portnum}'\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"addmergedblock\", \"params\": [\"hexdata\" '{\"currencyid\" : \"hexstring\", \"rpchost\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"rpcport\" : portnum, \"estimatedroi\" : (verusreward/hashrate)}'] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```### `definecurrency '{\"name\": \"coinortokenname\", ..., \"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"identity\"},..]}' '({\"name\": \"fractionalgatewayname\", ..., })' ({\"name\": \"reserveonename\", ..., }) ...`\nThis defines a blockchain currency, either as an independent blockchain, or as a token on this blockchain. It also spends the identity after which this currency is named and sets a bit indicating that it has a currently active blockchain in its name.",
