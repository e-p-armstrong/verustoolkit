    "What happens when a customer submits an order using the VerusPay gateway?",
    "When a customer submits an order using the VerusPay gateway, the order is placed \"on-hold\" while awaiting payment from the customer. The store monitors the wallet/address to confirm payment received before releasing the order and redirecting the customer to the Thank You page.",
    "This plugin extends *WooCommerce* on *Wordpress*, adding the ability to accept cryptocurrency payments in Verus Coin (VRSC) using either an on-store wallet daemon (best for VPS or dedicated hosting stores) or manually configured VRSC addresses (best for shared hosting stores).When an order is submitted via the VerusPay gateway, the order will be placed \"on-hold\" while awaiting payment from the customer. The customer has a limited time wherein to send the payment and the store monitors the wallet/address to confirm payment received before releasing the order and redirecting the customer to the Thank You page.VerusPay uses limited API functionality for Manual Mode, to communicate with the blockchain explorer in verifying payments and with the veruspay.io API to get up-to-date price data. These API's do not receive any private data either about the store owner, store, or customer. The only data sent to the block explorer API is the public/transparent blockchain transaction and address used. For VerusPay.io API price data, only the store-set currency is sent to retrieve the current fiat exchange rate for Verus Coin.[*VerusPay installation instructions*](https://github.com/monkins1010/VerusPay/wiki)## Be a part of it allFocus on Verus\u2019 social media presence has picked up with new, fresh looking Facebook and YouTube channels so check them out and feel free to post something or simply explore the content.
