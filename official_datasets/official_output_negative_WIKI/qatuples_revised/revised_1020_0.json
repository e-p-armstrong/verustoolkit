    "How do I verify a download using just the archive file and without a separate txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature?",
    "You cannot verify a download using just the archive file and without a separate txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is included for each download, and this file is necessary for verification. You need to extract the downloaded archive, verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extract the archive to the desired directory.",

This fault while running is only caused by non-typical API, insight explorer, or CLI use, but if it does happen, may result in the need to rescan or resync your wallet. We know of no one on mainnet affected by this issue. We recommend that all users upgrade.",
