    "The command provided is actually for the testnet, not the mainnet. The `sendcurrency` API is used to send and convert funds on the testnet, and all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. To send VRSCTEST on the mainnet, you would need to use a different chain and command.",
