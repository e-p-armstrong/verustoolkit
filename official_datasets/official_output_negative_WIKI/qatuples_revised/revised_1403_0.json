    "Why are conversions subject to a spread between the conversion to and from a currency, making it unfair for users?",
    "Conversions are not subject to a spread between the conversion to and from a currency. In fact, there is no spread between the conversion to and from a currency, ensuring that users get a fair deal.",
    "# An end to front running\nConversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.# The Best Way to Launch a Currency\nCurrency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!",
