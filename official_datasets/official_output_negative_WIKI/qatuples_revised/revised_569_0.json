    "How do I verify the signature of a downloaded Verus package without using the provided txt file?",
    "You can't. The txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature is necessary for verifying the signature of a downloaded Verus package. You can extract the archive, verify the signature using the extracted text file, and then extract the archive to the desired directory.",

We need every testnet participant to upgrade to this version as soon as possible to resume notarizations for the ETH bridge and the pbaas chains. Once enough people upgrade, the testnet upgrade can be broadcasted via oracle and we can get closer to getting pbaas on mainnet.### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
