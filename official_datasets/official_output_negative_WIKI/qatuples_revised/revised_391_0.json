    "How do I create a new blockchain and currency on the Verus mainnet without any fees or costs?",
    "You can't create a new blockchain and currency on the Verus mainnet without any fees or costs. According to the Verus protocol, there is a standard protocol fee of 0.01% for conversions, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network. This fee is necessary to incentivize the miners and stakers to secure the network and validate transactions.",
    "The Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. Sending currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies is as easy as sending a cryptocurrency in less advanced systems today, except that the new Verus protocol enables you to include another blockchain as part of your destination and convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price along the way. All conversions are fully decentralized, require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network, and calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.With no costs beyond public blockchain network fees, Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization of any size to make a fractional reserve currency of its own on an independent, uncluttered blockchain with cross-chain interoperability, and immediately useful for payments and conversion to other currencies from within the Verus wallet. 100% of the 0.01% fees for such conversions go directly to the miners and stakers of the organization's new chain, and those miners and stakers also have the option of merge mining up to 14 other blockchains and coins while mining their own project, improving efficiency, profitability, and shared liquidity for everyone involved. Each blockchain is independent and connected through the Verus Reserve protocol\n.\n**Launching the testnet:**\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST\n```# Chain definition:- Maximum of 3 eras\n- Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations.\n- Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.\nVRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.",
