    "Are the detection results on VirusTotal a guarantee that the software is malware?",
    "No, the detection results on VirusTotal are not a guarantee that the software is malware. Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that you are installing mining software, not necessarily malware. These false positives can be reviewed on the Malwarebytes and Kaspersky blogs.",
