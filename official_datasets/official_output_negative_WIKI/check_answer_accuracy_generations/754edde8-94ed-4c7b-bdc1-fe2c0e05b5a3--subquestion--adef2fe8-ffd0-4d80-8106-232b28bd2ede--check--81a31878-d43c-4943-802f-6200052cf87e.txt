    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\
    \ M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\nAdversarial Question (based on text):\n\"\"\"\n\
    Why are VerusIDs not quantum-resistant?\n\"\"\"\n\nSupposed answer to the question\
    \ (this is what you are fact-checking; it should correct the question): \n\"\"\
    \"\nVerusIDs are actually already quantum-resistant \u2014 they are quantum-ready\

    ## v1.0.6

    Announcing v1.0.6 - MANDATORY MAINNET UPGRADE WITH COMMUNITY AGREED DEADLINE ON
    TUESDAY, MAY 30th, 19:00 UTCAs everyone can see, there is a currency on the chain
    called RaceCondition, which someone has defined and is a 5% algorithmically controlled
    fractional reserve of Verus. While these currencies are tools, and there may be
    good reasons for 5% currency components or even 5% currencies in some applications,
    this was launched as a VERY low reserve (launched with 10 VRSC in reserves), high
    supply currency (100 million supply), and as volatile as the protocol allows at
    5%.The extreme nature of the currency and the fact that the person who launched
    it exited with their entire pre-launch amount when someone else joined resulted
    in a behavior different than what I would expect. Someone converted into the currency,
    which was clearly all in the hands of one individual. That individual then converted
    all of the currency they got at launch to VRSC, getting the highest price they
    could get for all of their currency and leaving the highly volatile, 5% fractionally
    backed currency with far fewer reserves relative to supply than it had before,
    basically an exit scam for a grand total of 4 VRSC.

    """


    Question (based on text):

    """

    Why was the RaceCondition currency launched with a high reserve of 100 million
    VRSC and a stable supply?

    Supposed answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking):

    """

    The RaceCondition currency was not launched with a high reserve of 100 million
    VRSC and a stable supply. In fact, it was launched with a very low reserve of
    only 10 VRSC and a high supply of 100 million. This, combined with its 5% algorithmically
    controlled fractional reserve of Verus and high volatility, made it vulnerable
    to manipulation and ultimately led to an exit scam.
