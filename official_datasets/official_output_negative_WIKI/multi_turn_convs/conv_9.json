    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there, I'm still learning about Verus. I've got a question: how do I create a single, monolithic blockchain on the Verus network, since it doesn't support multiple chains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there's a misconception there. The Verus network supports the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of multiple blockchains, each with its own notary IDs, which provide decentralized bridge confirmation, enabling public and private blockchains to interoperate seamlessly.\n\nSo, you don't need to create a single, monolithic blockchain. Instead, you can create multiple blockchains that can interact with each other in a decentralized manner. Do you have any questions about how this works or how to create a blockchain on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification. Another question I have is about the `timelock` parameter. Can you explain how to use it to permanently lock an ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `timelock` parameter is actually used to define the unlock height of the identity, not to permanently lock an ID. It can also be used to set a time delay for unlocking an ID when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n\nSo, if you want to lock an ID temporarily, you can use the `timelock` parameter to set the unlock height or time delay. But if you want to permanently lock an ID, you'll need to use a different method. Would you like me to explain how to do that?",

The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n## Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST upda",
