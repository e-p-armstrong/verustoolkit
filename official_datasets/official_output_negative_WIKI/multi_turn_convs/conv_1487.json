    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to initiate a token launch with the command `dcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'`. Can you walk me through how this works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misunderstanding. The command `dcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'` is not actually used to initiate a token launch. Instead, it's used to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to GOLD until the GOLD token launches. This command doesn't trigger the launch of the GOLD token.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. So what if I want to create a new token that can only be converted to with VRSCTEST, using the command `dcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'`? Would that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. The command `dcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'` is not related to creating a new token. To create a new token, you would need to use a different command, such as `definecurrency`. The command `dcurrency` is specifically used for parking conversions, not creating new tokens. If you want to create a new token, I'd be happy to help you with the correct command and process!",
