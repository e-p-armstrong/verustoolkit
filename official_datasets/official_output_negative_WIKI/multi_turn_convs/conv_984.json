    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST coins from a single address to multiple recipients, while also converting them to a different currency. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I have to clarify that the `sendcurrency` API can only be used to send and convert funds, but the examples provided show that it can only be used to send VRSCTEST coins from a single address to a single recipient, or from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, but without converting them to a different currency. There is no example or indication that it can be used to convert coins to a different currency. Unfortunately, it's not possible to achieve what you're trying to do with the `sendcurrency` API.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a bit disappointing. I've been playing around with VRSCTEST coins on the testnet. Are they valuable and permanent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, testnet coins/currencies, like VRSCTEST, have no value and will disappear whenever the VRSCTEST network is reset. They're meant for testing and development purposes only, so you shouldn't worry about losing any real value. Just remember to use them for testing and experimenting with the Verus protocol, and don't rely on them for any real-world transactions.",
