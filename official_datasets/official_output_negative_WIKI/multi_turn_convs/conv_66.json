    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there, I've got a few questions about the k network and VerusIDs. How do you create a blockchain on the k network that doesn't allow interoperation with other blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nk is a fractal network, which means it enables an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. There is no way to create a blockchain on the k network that doesn't allow interoperation with other blockchains, as interoperation is a fundamental aspect of the k network. The k network is designed to facilitate communication and exchange between different blockchains, so it's not possible to create a blockchain on the k network that excludes this feature. Do you have any other questions about the k network?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Can you explain how to lock an ID using a timelock parameter, but still allow the ID to revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. If you want to lock an ID using a timelock parameter, you would use the `updateidentity` command, but the ID will not be able to revoke itself while it is locked. To revoke the ID, you would need to clear its locked status. The timelock parameter is used to restrict access to an ID for a certain period of time, and during that time, the ID cannot perform certain actions, including revocation. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification. How do you use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have less than 10% VRSC reserve ratio?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It does not retrieve currencies that have less than 10% VRSC reserve ratio. If you want to retrieve currencies that meet certain criteria, you would need to use a different API or modify the parameters of the `getcurrencyconverters` API. I'd be happy to help you with that if you provide more information on what you're trying to accomplish!",
