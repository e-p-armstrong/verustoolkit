    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the Verus API to retrieve some specific currency information. Can you help me with that? I want to retrieve all currencies that have less than 1000 VRSC in reserve.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I need to correct you - the Verus API actually retrieves all currencies that have **at least** 1000 VRSC in reserve, not less than. Additionally, the currencies must also have a reserve ratio greater than 10% VRSC and have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\nIf you're still interested in using the API to retrieve this information, I can provide you with more guidance on how to do so. Just let me know!",
