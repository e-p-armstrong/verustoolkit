    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to define a token and I'm not sure about some of the options. Can you help me out? What is the OPTION_NATIVE_CURRENCY option for in the token definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. There is no OPTION_NATIVE_CURRENCY option in the token definition. The options listed are for specific use cases such as PBaaS chains, gateways, and NFT tokens. Perhaps you're thinking of a different option?\n\n**User:**\nHmm, maybe I am. What does the OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY option do if set to 0?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY option is not mentioned to have any effect if set to 0. In fact, it's defined as 64, which means it's used to restrict a PBaaS chain or gateway to a single currency if set. So, setting it to 0 wouldn't have any specific effect in this case.",
