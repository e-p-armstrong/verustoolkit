    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to export my wallet using the `z_exportwallet` command, but I'm not sure how to specify the filename. Can I specify a filename with a file extension for the `z_exportwallet` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't specify a filename with a file extension for the `z_exportwallet` command. The filename you replace `<mywalletexport>` with can only contain letters and figures, no other characters, which means it cannot have a file extension. Just use a simple filename without an extension.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, if I want to export my wallet, I can just type `z_exportwallet <mywalletexport>` in the CLI section of Agama, right?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot quite. You need to select VRSC in the CLI section of Agama first, then type `z_exportwallet <mywalletexport>` and click the button below to run it. Make sure you select the correct coin (VRSC) before running the command.",
