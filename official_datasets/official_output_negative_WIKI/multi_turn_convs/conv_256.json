    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about creating new tokens on Verus. Is it possible to create a new token without converting any VRSCTEST to the new token?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, that's not possible. To create a new token, you need to have a certain amount of VRSCTEST preconverted to the new token. For example, to launch GOLD, you need 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD. This is part of the mining process, where mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new token.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But I was wondering if there's a way around that. Can I create a new token without having to convert VRSCTEST to it, using a decentralized issuance option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, after a token launches, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. There is no decentralized issuance option.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So what happens if I try to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you try to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, your conversion will be parked until the token launches. Once the token launches, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. You can use the following command to park your conversion:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nNote that this command will park your conversion, and it will be processed once the GOLD token launches.",
