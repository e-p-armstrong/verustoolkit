    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm creating a new currency on Verus and I was wondering, what are the benefits of using an i-address as the name of an ID when creating a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I'd advise against using an i-address as the name of an ID when creating a currency. This is because it can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used, and it won't be supported for creating currencies. The protocol doesn't prevent making an ID with an i-address as its name, but it's not advised due to potential user confusion.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. I've been using Verus for a while now, and I've generally had a good experience. But I was wondering, is the Verus software fully tested and guaranteed to work without any issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. The Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and it's used at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the software is provided without any guarantees or promises of reliability. We're constantly working to improve and stabilize the software, but it's still a work in progress.",

            "Actually, it's not recommended to use an i-address as the name of an ID when creating a currency.

            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2.
