    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have some questions about PBaaS chains. Can you explain how to set a token to be a native currency in a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to help. However, I need to clarify that it is not possible to set a token as a native currency in a PBaaS chain. The options provided are for specific use cases such as restricting to a single currency, routing external currencies, or defining a PBaaS chain, but there is no option to set a token as a native currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I was also wondering about the OPTION_MULTICURRENCY flag in a PBaaS chain definition. What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there is no OPTION_MULTICURRENCY flag in a PBaaS chain definition. The text does not mention such an option. It does mention OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY, which is used to restrict a PBaaS chain or gateway to a single currency, but there is no option specifically for multiple currencies. I hope that clears things up!",
