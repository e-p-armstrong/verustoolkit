    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring the features of VerusIDs, and I was wondering, are there any limitations to their self-sovereignty, revocability, and recoverability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, VerusID enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. There are no limitations in these aspects. VerusIDs are designed to provide users with complete control over their digital identity, data, and assets, while also allowing for revocation and recovery in case of loss or compromise.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I've also been looking into Verus Vault, and I was wondering, can it be used for staking without time locking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault is specifically designed for staking-capable time locking and theft prevention. It enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. The time locking feature is an essential part of Verus Vault's design, and it's not possible to use it for staking without time locking.",
