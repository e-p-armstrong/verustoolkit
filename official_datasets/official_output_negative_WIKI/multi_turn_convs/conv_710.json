    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've tried creating a new identity using the `registeridentity` command, but I'm not sure why I can't use it right away. Can you explain why it's not possible to use a newly created identity immediately after running the `registeridentity` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can use your new identity as soon as the transaction created by the `registeridentity` command is mined into the blockchain. You don't need to wait for any additional steps or confirmations. It's just a matter of waiting for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks! I was worried I'd have to wait a while. But what if I don't have enough funds to register a new identity? Is there a way to register an identity on the blockchain without enough funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't register an identity on the blockchain without enough funds. You need to have enough funds to register a new identity on the blockchain. There's no way to bypass this requirement, as it's a necessary part of the process.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I've also been wondering about revoking and recovering identities. Is it possible to revoke or recover an identity without having the authority to do so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible to revoke or recover an identity without having the authority to do so. You need to have the authority to revoke and recover identities, or use identities under your control as revocation or recovery authorities for other identities. Without the proper authority, you won't be able to perform these actions.",
