    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got some questions about VerusCoin. What is the mining algorithm used by VerusCoin, and is it vulnerable to 51% attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe mining algorithm used by VerusCoin is VerusHash 2.1, which is a PoW/PoS 50/50 algorithm. This algorithm is designed to be CPU targeted, non-discriminatory, and CPU/FPGA equalizing. Moreover, it's **Proof of Power**, which makes it 51% attack resistant.\n\n**User:**\nThat's reassuring. I've also heard some rumors about pre-mining during the ICO. How many VerusCoins were pre-mined during the ICO?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere was no pre-mine or ICO for VerusCoin. The total supply is 83,540,184 VRSC, and all coins were mined through the Proof of Work and Proof of Stake mechanisms. So, there were no pre-mined coins, and the distribution of coins is fair and transparent.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about VerusID. Is VerusID just a simple ID system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusID is not just a simple ID system. It's a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides plenty of opportunities for identity applications. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. VerusID offers a lot more than just a simple ID system, and it's a key part of the Verus ecosystem.",
