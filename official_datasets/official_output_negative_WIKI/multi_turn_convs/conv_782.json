    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still a bit unclear about the capabilities of different types of IDs on the Verus blockchain. Can any ID, regardless of whether it's native or not, launch currencies on the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not all IDs can launch currencies on the Verus blockchain. Only Native IDs, which are registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, can launch currencies on that blockchain. IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies. Does that clarify things for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about *.veth gateway IDs? Do they require permission from a central authority to register and create Ethereum mapped currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, *.veth gateway IDs do not require permission from a central authority to register and create Ethereum mapped currencies. They are available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter. This allows for a more open and accessible system.\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering, are IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies completely useless on the Verus blockchain? Since they can't launch currencies, I wasn't sure if they had any other purpose.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies are not completely useless on the Verus blockchain. While they cannot launch currencies, they can still be valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs, as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features, for proofs, for brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login, and will have the ability to cross-prove common ownership with other IDs as well. They still have a range of useful applications, even if they can't launch currencies.",
