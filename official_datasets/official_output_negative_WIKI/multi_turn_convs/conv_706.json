    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been having some issues with signature verification, and I was wondering if you could help me out. What does it mean when the result of a signature verification is `false`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that! According to the documentation, when the result of a signature verification is `false`, it's not explicitly stated what that means. However, it does specify that the result will be `true` if the signature is valid. So, in this case, it's likely that the signature is not valid, but without more information, it's hard to say for sure. Would you like some help troubleshooting the issue?\n\n**User:**\nThat's a bit unclear, but I think I can figure it out. I also had a question about upgrading to v1.0.1. Is the upgrade to v1.0.1 optional for continued mainnet and testnet use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the upgrade to v1.0.1 or later is actually MANDATORY for continued mainnet and testnet use after May 21, 2023, expected block #2546600. So, if you want to continue using the mainnet and testnet, you'll need to upgrade to v1.0.1 or later by that date.",
