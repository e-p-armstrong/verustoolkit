    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to create a new token on Verus and I have a few questions. How do I specify the maximum supply of a token in the \"initialsupply\" field?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can't specify the maximum supply of a token in the \"initialsupply\" field. The \"initialsupply\" field specifies the supply after conversion of contributions, before preallocation, not the maximum supply. You'll need to look into other fields or configurations to set the maximum supply for your token.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. I also had a question about the \"prelaunchcarveout\" field. Is it mandatory to specify this field when creating a new token?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not mandatory to specify the \"prelaunchcarveout\" field. It's an optional field that specifies the percentage of pre-converted amounts from each reserve currency. You can choose to include it or not, depending on your token's specific needs. If you're unsure about how to configure this field or others, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to help!",
