    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got another question, I'm trying to sign transactions from a single-signature ID on the Verus testnet. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that process isn't applicable to single-signature IDs. To sign transactions from a multi-signature ID, you need to create a transaction, get the raw transaction data, take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs, sign the raw transaction, and then broadcast the signed transaction on the network. But since you're using a single-signature ID, you don't need to go through that process. Would you like to know more about using multi-signature IDs or is there something else I can help you with?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks. I've also been wondering, is the Verus testnet a fully centralized blockchain platform?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus testnet is not a fully centralized blockchain platform. It is an \"intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform\" with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. This means that it is a decentralized platform, not a centralized one. Does that clarify things for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks for the clarification. One more thing, do I need programming knowledge to use the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need programming knowledge to use the Verus testnet. You can create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming, using the easy GUI for basic operations or the command line for more advanced functions. So, feel free to explore and experiment with the testnet without worrying about needing to write code!",
