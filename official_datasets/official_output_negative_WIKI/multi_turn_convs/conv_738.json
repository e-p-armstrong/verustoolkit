    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about VerusIDs and I'm impressed. But I have a question. How do Verus IDs ensure that all funds sent to them are quantum-resistant from the moment of creation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus IDs do not ensure that all funds sent to them are quantum-resistant from the moment of creation. While Verus IDs themselves are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms, the transactions involving them are not quantum-resistant until the quantum secure signature scheme is activated on the mainnet, which is expected to happen early next year. However, once this scheme is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\n\n**User:**\nThat clears things up, thanks! Another thing I was wondering about is, can Verus IDs be created only with permission from a central authority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus IDs can be created by anyone without permission from a central authority. They are a fully decentralized protocol, and anyone can create a Verus ID and have complete, self-sovereign control over it. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers, rather than a central authority. This is one of the key benefits of VerusIDs - they empower individuals to take control of their digital identity and assets.",

            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerus IDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.",
