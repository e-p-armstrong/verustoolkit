    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I had a few questions about the current status of Verus and its features. How does the current network status affect the launch of DeFi, multicurrency, and non-cross-chain functions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe current network status doesn't hinder the launch of DeFi, multicurrency, and non-cross-chain functions. In fact, all these functions are already enabled and the network has been running smoothly since activation. So, you can start using them without any issues.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I was also wondering about the ETH bridge. Is it already launched on testnet and mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the ETH bridge is not yet launched on testnet or mainnet. It is still undergoing final changes and review, and it will likely require at least a couple of days on testnet to finish its review before it can be launched. We'll keep you updated on its progress.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question: Can you only buy and sell VerusIDs through intermediaries?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can buy and sell VerusIDs directly, peer-to-peer, without any intermediary necessary, using a completely decentralized approach. You can execute transactions directly, and even select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants if you choose to do so. The beauty of VerusIDs is that they provide a decentralized and self-sovereign way to manage your digital identity and assets.",
