    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've heard that there's an upgrade to v0.8.0-4 coming up. I'm not sure what it's all about. Can you tell me what happens if I don't upgrade and continue running the old version after the network resumes transaction imports/exports to and from Rinkeby?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't upgrade to v0.8.0-4 and continue running the old version after the network resumes transaction imports/exports to and from Rinkeby, you may need to resync to testnet from scratch to continue. It's strongly recommended that you upgrade to avoid any potential issues.\n\n**User:**\nSo, does that mean the testnet will be reset after the upgrade to v0.8.0-4?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the testnet will not be reset after the upgrade to v0.8.0-4. Anyone who has upgraded to v0.8.0-4 or does so before connecting again to testnet should only see improvement without disruption. You can continue using the testnet as usual after the upgrade.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the main reason for this upgrade to v0.8.0-4, anyway? Is it just a bunch of bug fixes or is there something more significant?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main reason for the upgrade to v0.8.0-4 is to enable support for much larger proofs than was previously possible, among other fixes and improvements. It's an important update that will bring some significant benefits to the network, so it's definitely worth upgrading!",

I hope we can keep that level of participation or more up, as it has been extremely helpful. Because of all that\u2019s happened on this testnet to date, we were able to make a lot of progress in finding and resolving the following testnet issues in this release:1. Enable support for much larger proofs than was previously possible from systems that either have large proofs required or significantly variable length proofs. Having this capability in the daemon will pave the way for more types of cross-chain proving in the future as well.\n2. Fix failed refunds of conversion transactions attempted after a fractional currency launches, but before it\u2019s preconversion phase is complete. If you sent transactions during this time, you may have stuck refunds that should flow after this upgrade.\n3. Ensure that currencies are marked as \u201claunch complete\u201d immediately after all preconversions have been processed, enabling normal conversions in all directions from that point forward.\n4. Fix an issue that left some import notarizations incomplete and caused cross-chain transfers to wait longer than expected after some imports.\n5. Improve and validate hardening.",
