    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about Verus mining software. I've been trying to download it, but my antivirus software keeps flagging it as a virus. I use Avast and Kaspersky, and they both say it's a virus. Is Verus mining software actually a virus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to clear this up for you. Avast and Kaspersky do not consider Verus mining software to be a virus. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is mining software and may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is not an indication that the software is malicious, but rather a cautionary measure to inform users of the software's purpose.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was worried there for a second. Another question I have is about verifying downloads. Can I use any identity to verify a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the downloads are signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\", and you should use this specific identity to verify the signature of the download. Using any other identity would not be valid. It's important to ensure that you're verifying the download with the correct identity to ensure the authenticity and security of the software.",
