    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have a question about Veruscoin version 0.4.0e. Is the default behavior of staking to send the coinbase to a random address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. In version 0.4.0e, staking will again default to sending the coinbase to the address that staked the reward, unless the `-pubkey=66charpubkey` option is set. So, the default behavior is to send the coinbase to the address that earned the stake, not a random address.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. I also had a question about the Agama GUI in version 0.4.0e. Does it show multiple lines for a staking transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. In version 0.4.0e, the Agama GUI no longer shows ins and outs or multiple lines for a staking transaction. Instead, it now displays an easy-to-understand single line for each \"stake\" transaction. So, you'll see a simple and straightforward display of your staking transactions in the Agama GUI.",
