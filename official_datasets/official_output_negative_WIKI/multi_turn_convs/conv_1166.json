    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been hearing about the v0.9.9 upgrade on the Verus mainnet. Can you tell me what the purpose of this upgrade is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the v0.9.9 upgrade is intended for the Verus test network, not the mainnet. It fixes known testnet issues and allows users to sync fully and resume cross-chain operations on the test network. Do you have any other questions about the upgrade?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was worried that the upgrade would reset the testnet. Will it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the v0.9.9 upgrade will not reset the testnet. It specifically fixes all known testnet issues with no reset, allowing users to resume operations without losing any progress.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a relief. I've also heard that auto-notarization is now enabled on the testnet with the v0.9.9 upgrade. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, auto-notarization is not yet enabled on the testnet with the v0.9.9 upgrade. It will be enabled on testnet in sync when the testfork executes, which is a future event. Until then, witnessed cross-chain operations should be able to resume if they had difficulty previously.",

As mentioned, someone seems to have mined with an intermediate version along the way on testnet and made the network unavailable without a bootstrap on the older daemon. This version should fix that issue as well as any cross-chain difficulties. Auto-notarization will be enabled on testnet in sync when the testfork executes.
