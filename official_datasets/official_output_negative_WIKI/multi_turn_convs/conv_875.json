    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm really interested in creating my own blockchain on the Verus network. How do I create a new blockchain on the Verus mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, it's not possible to create a new blockchain on the Verus mainnet. The Verus public testnet, not the mainnet, enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies. You can launch the testnet by running `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST`. On the testnet, you can create a new blockchain with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering, what is the conversion fee for cross-chain conversions on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe conversion fee for cross-chain conversions on the Verus network is 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network. This is a standard protocol fee.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Another question I had was, can I create a fractional reserve currency on the Verus network without creating a new blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, with Verus PBaaS Reserve technology, you can create a fractional reserve currency of your own on an independent, uncluttered blockchain with cross-chain interoperability. This means you need to create a new blockchain to create a fractional reserve currency.\n\n**User:**\nI see. One last question: How many blockchains can miners and stakers merge mine at the same time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMiners and stakers have the option of merge mining up to 14 other blockchains and coins while mining their own project.",
