    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a new token on Verus, but I'm not sure about the requirements. Can I create a new token without funding the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot create a new token without funding the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command to initiate a currency launch. This is a necessary step to ensure the proper creation and launching of your new token.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I'm also wondering about converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. Can I convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches. However, you can use a command like `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'` to park your conversion until the token launches. Then, at which point you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. This way, you can prepare for the launch of the GOLD token and ensure a smooth conversion process.",
