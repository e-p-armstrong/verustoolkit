    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a few more questions about using VerusIDs. How do I unlock an ID without setting a timelock or time delay?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to unlock an ID without setting a timelock or time delay. The timelock parameter is used to define the unlock height of the identity or the delay before an ID is unlocked when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. There is no way to bypass this mechanism and unlock an ID without setting a timelock or time delay.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Another question I had is, can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. So, if you want to revoke a locked identity, you'll need to follow the standard revocation process, which will automatically remove the lock.",
