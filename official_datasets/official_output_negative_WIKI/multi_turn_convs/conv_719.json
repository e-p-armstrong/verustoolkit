    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about multi-signature IDs in Verus. Why do you need to use a third-party service to sign transactions from them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a common misconception! You don't actually need to use a third-party service to sign transactions from multi-signature IDs in Verus. Instead, you can use the `verus signrawtransaction` command to sign the raw transaction data with the additional signing addresses/IDs. This gives you full control over the signing process and doesn't require relying on a third-party service.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! I've also heard some rumors about the Verus testnet. Is it a centralized platform that only allows a limited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true! The Verus testnet is not a centralized platform. It is an intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that allows for an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. This means that anyone can create their own identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any restrictions. The testnet is designed to be a playground for developers and users to experiment and build on the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! One last question: can I only use the Verus CLI wallet to access the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you're not limited to just the CLI wallet! You can access the Verus testnet using both the Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets. Both of these wallets provide access to the full features of the Verus testnet, allowing you to create identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains, as well as send currencies and convert between them. You can choose the wallet that best fits your needs and preferences.",
