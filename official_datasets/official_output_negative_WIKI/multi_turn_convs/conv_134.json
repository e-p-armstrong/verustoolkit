    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand the process of launching a new currency on Verus. I've heard that I need to send a certain amount of VRSCTEST to the identity of the currency before launching it. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou're close! You actually need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST, not 10,000. Additionally, you need to preconvert 1000 VRSCTEST at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch the currency. This is a one-time setup process to get your currency up and running.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Thanks for the correction! After I send the `definecurrency` command, can I convert VRSCTEST to GOLD immediately?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't convert VRSCTEST to GOLD right away. The currency launch happens 50 blocks after the `definecurrency` command is sent, and only then can you convert VRSCTEST to GOLD. However, you can park your conversion with the `sendcurrency` command, and it will be executed when the token launches. Just a minor delay, but an important one!\n\n**User:**\nGot it! And finally, can anyone create new tokens for GOLD after it launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, currently, the only way to create new tokens for GOLD after it launches is through a centralized issuance option. So, once your currency is live, new tokens can only be created through that central authority.",
