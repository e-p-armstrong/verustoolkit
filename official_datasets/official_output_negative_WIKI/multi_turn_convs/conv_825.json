    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still trying to understand how identities work in Verus. How do identities in Verus work without a set of addresses or a minimum number of signatures required?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, identities in Verus do require a set of addresses (one or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. This is a fundamental aspect of how identities function in Verus. Would you like me to explain more about how this works?\n\n**User:**\nThat clears up a bit of confusion. I also had a question about the Revocation authority. Can the Revocation authority spend funds or sign on behalf of the primary identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Revocation authority cannot spend funds or sign on behalf of the primary identity. The Revocation authority can only revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control. The Revocation authority's role is limited to revoking the identity, not controlling its funds or actions.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the Recovery authority? Can the Recovery authority modify an unrevoked identity or change the Revocation authority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Recovery authority cannot modify an unrevoked identity or change the Revocation authority. The Recovery authority may only redefine or recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the Revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I was also wondering, do identities in Verus remain the same even if new address types or signature algorithms are added to the blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, if a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure, is added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend condition. This means that identities in Verus can evolve and adapt to new security features and technologies. Does that make sense?",

Each identity also refers to two additional identities that have authority over:\n  - **Primary** - this is the self identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.\n  - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n  - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.\n3. Identities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party\u2019s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.\n4. If an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred.
