    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been using Verus for a while now, and I've got a question about the `refundfailedlaunch` command. Can I use it to refund contributions made to a successful PbaaS chain launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `refundfailedlaunch` command is specifically for refunding contributions made to a failed PbaaS chain launch, not a successful one. The command is `verus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME`, and it's used to refund contributions made to a PbaaS chain launch that did not succeed. It's not intended for successful launches.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've been using Verus for a while, and I've been pretty happy with it. But I did have a question about the software itself. Is the Verus software guaranteed to work perfectly and never cause any damage?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and it comes with a disclaimer that states it's provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind. This means that there is no guarantee that the software will work perfectly or not cause any damage. The disclaimer explicitly states that the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. So, while we strive to make Verus the best it can be, there are no guarantees.",
