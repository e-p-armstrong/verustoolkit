    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I heard about the recent testnet upgrade to the Ethereum bridge contracts. I was wondering, did it need to be done on the mainnet as well?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the recent testnet upgrade to the Ethereum bridge contracts did not need to be done on the mainnet. In fact, this upgrade is not expected to be needed again on testnet and is not needed on mainnet with the new contract upgrade model. So, it's a testnet-only upgrade.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering, what's the purpose of the remnants of the testnet history in the daemon and final protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe remnants of the testnet history in the daemon and final protocol are there to enable compatibility with the history of testnet, not because they are needed on mainnet PBaaS. To be honest, it would be best to remove this testnet history from the code before mainnet activation to make the code base cleaner and more efficient. It's a bit of technical debt that we can clean up before moving forward.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. Looking ahead, will the next testnet upgrade be compatible with the current testnet and its earlier history?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the next testnet upgrade will not be compatible with the current testnet and its earlier history. The plan is to create one final testnet, but with a clean slate, removing the testnet history from the code, which would make the next upgrade incompatible with today's testnet and its earlier history. We're taking the opportunity to start fresh and make the testnet more efficient and easier to work with.",

            "### What\u2019s New for TestNet\nThis release includes an activation that allows a major upgrade to the testnet Ethereum bridge contracts that is both not expected to be needed again on testnet and not ever needed on mainnet with the new contract upgrade model. This upgrade should clear all known issues on the bridge to Goerli, meaning any remaining bridge transactions will be delivered, and the ETH bridge should then be fully functional.### The Path for PBaaS to Mainnet\nThis testnet has actually been through a lot already, more than we expected before mainnet, and this last experience, along with its full restoration of cross-chain and all function has been very useful and was the impetus for the Verus Oracle Notification technology. In the process of getting here, we implemented the necessary changes and fixes to get everything back on track, but we also have remnants of these events in the daemon, and on the final protocol, these are there to enable compatibility with the history of testnet, not because we need these upgrades on mainnet PBaaS. It gave us experience, increased confidence, and pushed us to develop a fast, decentralized network response capability. At the same time, it would be best for our code base, both on the Verus side and in the ETH contracts if that testnet history is removed from the code before mainnet activation. Doing so would make the next upgrade incompatible with today\u2019s testnet and its earlier history.As a result, we have decided that we will create one final testnet, but this time, we would do it a little differently than in the past. We will extend the pre-PBaaS upgrade on the existing testnet to a future date via the oracles. If you have started a chain and control the default oracle on any chain, please check the #pbaas-development channel for instructions on setting your oracle to extend the upgrade.",
