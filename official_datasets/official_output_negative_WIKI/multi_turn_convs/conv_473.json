    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got some questions about Verus and its technology. I'm trying to understand how the `k` fractal works. How does it allow for only a limited number of interoperable blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there may be some misunderstanding. The `k` fractal actually enables an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. It does not impose any limits on the number of blockchains that can operate together.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I had a different understanding of it. Thanks for clearing that up. I also had a question about locked identities. Can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. If an identity is revoked, its locked status will be cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height that may have been set.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks. And one more question. I'm trying to use the `getcurrencyconverters` API. Will it return all currencies that have at least 100 VRSC in reserve?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getcurrencyconverters` API will only return currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, not 100. Additionally, it requires that the reserve ratio is greater than 10% VRSC and that all listed currencies are reserves.",
