    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having some trouble with the `definecurrency` command, specifically with the `proofprotocol` option. What is the purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to a specific value in the `definecurrency` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSetting `proofprotocol` to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID, allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. This is an important configuration option when defining a new currency on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. I've also been looking at the initial supply of a currency in the `definecurrency` command. What is the initial supply of \"mycoin\" set to in the `definecurrency` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe initial supply of \"mycoin\" is set to 20000 in the `definecurrency` command. This means that there will be 20,000 units of \"mycoin\" available when the currency is first created.",
