    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm analyzing a transaction and I'm trying to understand the fields in the transaction output. What is the \"id\" field in the transaction output that identifies the specific output?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere's a bit of confusion here. There is no \"id\" field in the transaction output. The fields that identify the output are actually \"n\" (index of the JSDescription within vJoinSplit), \"jsOutput\" (index of the output within the JSDescription), and \"output\" (index of the output within the vShieldedOutput), which serve as identifiers for the output.\n\n**User:**\nThat clears things up. What about the \"address\" field? Is it always a VRSC address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the \"address\" field is a Zcash address, not a VRSC address. It represents the Zcash address involved in the transaction.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What does the \"recovered\" field indicate about the output?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"recovered\" field indicates whether the output is for an address in the wallet or not. If \"recovered\" is true, it means the output is not for an address in the wallet. If it's false, it means the output is for an address in the wallet.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about the \"memo\" field? Is it always a human-readable string?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the \"memo\" field is a hexadecimal string representation of the memo field. There is a separate field called \"memoStr\" that returns the memo as a human-readable string, but only if the memo contains valid UTF-8 text.",
