This software is explicitly labeled as experimental and unfinished, and it comes with a warning to use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the software is provided \"as is\" without any implied or express warranties. So, it's essential to keep that in mind when using Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering, can I modify and distribute this software without giving credit to the original authors?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the permission notice explicitly requires that the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
