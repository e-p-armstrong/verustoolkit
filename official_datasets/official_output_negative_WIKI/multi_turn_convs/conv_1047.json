    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've been having some issues with Verus software. Avast and Kaspersky keep flagging it as a virus. What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI can help you with that! Avast and Kaspersky don't actually flag Verus software as a virus. They might flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is just a warning that you're installing mining software. This software could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC, so the antivirus software is just being cautious.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was also wondering if I can use this software for the main net?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, this software is actually a test release, intended to be used with test chains. It's not recommended to use it for the main net.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. I'm playing around with creating a chain, and I was wondering how many eras I can define in a chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can define a maximum of 3 eras in a chain.\n\n**User:**\nCool, that helps. One more question: do I need to run VRSCTEST to connect to a defined chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, once a chain is created, you only need to run VRSCTEST to merge mine. After the initial connection, a local config file is created, and you can connect to the chain without running VRSCTEST.",
