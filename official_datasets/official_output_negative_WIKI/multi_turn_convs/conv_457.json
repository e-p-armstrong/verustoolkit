    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with the `verus` command and I'm a bit confused about the `getcurrencyconverters` command. What's the purpose of using it with a single currency argument, like `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` command is actually not intended to be used with a single currency argument. It's meant to be used with two currencies as arguments, like `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth`. This command returns all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold. Using it with a single currency argument won't give you the intended result.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, does the `getcurrencyconverters` command return all possible currency pairs that can be converted between each other?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it doesn't return all possible currency pairs that can be converted between each other. Instead, it returns all currencies that have a market between the two specified currencies (e.g., BTC and ETH) at or above the liquidity threshold. It's a more specific result than all possible currency pairs. Does that make sense?",
