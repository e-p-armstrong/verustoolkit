    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the Verus blockchain and I was wondering, can you explain why the Verus blockchain is limited to only a few simultaneously operating blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus blockchain is not limited to only a few simultaneously operating blockchains. In fact, it is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. So, there's no limitation in terms of the number of blockchains that can operate at the same time.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I've also come across some questions about revoking IDs. How do you unlock an ID that has been revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can't unlock an ID that has been revoked. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. Once an ID is revoked, it's irreversible.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I also had a question about locked identities. Can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. The revocation authority, which may be the ID itself or another ID, is required to revoke a locked identity.",
