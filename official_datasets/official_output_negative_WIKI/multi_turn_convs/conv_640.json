    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into Verus and I'm interested in creating a new blockchain on the Verus mainnet. I don't have any programming knowledge, is this possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhile it's not possible to create a new blockchain on the Verus mainnet without programming knowledge, you can create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains on the Verus testnet. This is possible using the easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. The testnet is a great way to experiment and test out your ideas without affecting the mainnet.\n\n**User:**\nSo I'll need to use the Verus CLI wallet to access the new testnet, right?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you're not limited to just the Verus CLI wallet. The new Verus testnet is accessible from both the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets. You can choose the one that's most comfortable for you to use.",

It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.",
