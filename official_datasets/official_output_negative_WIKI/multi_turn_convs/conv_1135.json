    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about how Verus manages its network upgrades. How does the Verus protocol compromise on decentralization to enable seamless network upgrades?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus protocol does not compromise on decentralization to enable seamless network upgrades. In fact, the consensus-capable oracle notifications built into the core protocol allow for dynamic, coordinated consensus changes without any compromise on decentralization. Verus has managed to find a way to balance decentralization with the need for seamless upgrades, which is quite impressive.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! Speaking of upgrades, will the mainnet PBaaS upgrade be activated immediately with this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the mainnet PBaaS upgrade will not be activated immediately with this release. Although this release has the ability to upgrade mainnet to PBaaS, it is prudent to have some time on this new protocol on testnet before the v1.0 release, which will upgrade mainnet. It's always better to be cautious and test things thoroughly before making significant changes to the mainnet.",

            "2. **Enabling Seamless Decentralized Network Upgrades**: This release includes a Verus invention of consensus-capable oracle notifications built into the core protocol, which enable dynamic coordinated consensus changes that can be triggered at a time decided after the actual release which enables them, all without any compromise on decentralization. The Verus Community may decide that we are ready to go earlier than one week on this upgrade and activate it, even before its scheduled time. The good news is that this first test upgrade will primarily affect testnet and prepare for the mainnet PBaaS upgrade, so it is a perfect test case for a mainnet test run before we #LaunchPBaaS. This release actually has the ability to upgrade mainnet to PBaaS, but we believe it is prudent to have at least some time on this new protocol on testnet before the v1.0 release, which will upgrade mainnet. If we make no additional changes to the protocol in this release, which we do not intend to do at this time, this version may be able to follow the v1.0 upgrade. If we determine that it cannot, the oracle upgrade technology will enable the daemon to recognize that it is not capable and request that the user upgrade to a newer version without requiring a bootstrap for the upgrade. **(Mainnet + Testnet)**",
