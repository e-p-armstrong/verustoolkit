    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `listunspent` command, but I'm not entirely sure what to expect from the output. Can you tell me what format the output is in?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe output of the `listunspent` command is an array of objects, each of which has the following properties: `txid`, `vout`, `scriptPubKey`, `amount`, and `confirmations`. This should give you a clear idea of what to expect from the command. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
