    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got another question about VerusIDs. Can you explain why locked VerusIDs cannot be revoked or recovered?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, locked VerusIDs can be revoked and recovered by their revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. This means that even if someone has the primary keys, including a multisig of primary keys, they must first unlock and wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. Meanwhile, the revocation and recovery authorities can revoke and recover the ID at any time, providing an added layer of security and protection. Does that clarify things for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense! Another question I had is how does Verus Vault work like a traditional bank, where you need to physically visit a branch to recover your funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault does not work like a traditional bank, where you need to physically visit a branch to recover your funds. Instead, it provides a decentralized solution to fund recovery, where you can set a unlock delay on your locked IDs, and a company or individual with the revocation ID can revoke and recover your funds remotely, without the need for physical presence. This way, you can recover your funds from anywhere, without having to physically visit a bank branch.\n\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with the Verus testnet and I was wondering, what is the purpose of deleting the Verus testnet directories on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows 10?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of deleting the Verus testnet directories on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows 10 is to reset the testnet, not to recover funds or IDs. After deleting the directories, you need to restart the testnet daemon or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native to complete the reset process. This helps you start fresh with the testnet and try out new scenarios or test different configurations.",

            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n  ```",
