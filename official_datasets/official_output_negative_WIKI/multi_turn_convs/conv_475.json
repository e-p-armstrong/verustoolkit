    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm thinking of launching a new currency on Verus, but I'm not sure about the process. Can you help me out? Specifically, how do I launch a new currency without preconverting VRSCTEST to it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLaunching a new currency on Verus is an exciting venture! Unfortunately, it's not possible to launch a new currency without preconverting VRSCTEST to it. To initiate a currency launch, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST and preconvert 1000 VRSCTEST at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD. This is a requirement for the currency launch to be successful. Would you like more information on the launch process or the requirements?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Once a currency has launched, can I create new tokens without a centralized issuance option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrently, the only way to create new tokens after a currency has launched is with a centralized issuance option. There is no decentralized way to create new tokens at present. However, the Verus team is constantly working on improving the platform, so it's possible that this might change in the future. Would you like to know more about the current token creation process?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. If I convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, will I receive the converted amount immediately?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, if you convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, the conversion will be parked until the token launches. After the launch, you will either receive the converted amount of GOLD or have your VRSCTEST returned, depending on the outcome of the launch. So, you won't receive the converted amount immediately, but rather after the launch is complete. Do you have any more questions about the conversion process or token launches in general?",
