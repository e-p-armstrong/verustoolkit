    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST from a single address to multiple recipients, and I was wondering if it's possible to convert the currency to a different one, like GOLD, in the process. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that! Unfortunately, the `sendcurrency` API does not support converting currency in the same transaction as sending funds. The examples provided only show how to send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, or from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients. Converting the currency to a different one would require a separate transaction.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, about these testnet coins/currencies, like VRSCTEST... are they valuable and can be used in real-world transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, all testnet coins/currencies, including VRSCTEST, have no value and will disappear whenever the testnet is reset. They are only for testing purposes and cannot be used in real-world transactions. They're essentially a simulated environment to help you test and develop your applications without using real funds.",
