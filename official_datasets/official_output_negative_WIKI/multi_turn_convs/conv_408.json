    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm curious about the current state of Verus. What's the current status of the Verus mainnet release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe current status of the Verus mainnet release is not yet released. The focus is on protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure. The Verus PBaaS protocol is considered release candidate RC1 for the coming mainnet upgrade. We're getting close, but there's still some work to be done before the mainnet is ready.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I'm also wondering about the supported operating systems. Is Debian 9 (Stretch) still supported by Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Debian 9 (Stretch) is no longer supported by Verus. We've moved on to supporting more modern operating systems to ensure better security and performance.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I've also heard about the PBaaS capabilities. Are the PBaaS capabilities only available on the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the PBaaS capabilities, including those for application development, are already available on the new Verus testnet. They will be available on the mainnet soon. You can start exploring and building on the testnet today, and then easily transition to the mainnet when it's released.",
