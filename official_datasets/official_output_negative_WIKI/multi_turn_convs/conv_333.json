    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about the Verus software. I was installing it and my antivirus software, Avast, flagged it as suspicious. Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky not flag the Verus software as malicious?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Actually, Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which are warnings that you are installing mining software that could potentially be used to exploit your PC. This is not because the software is malicious, but because it is mining software that could be used for nefarious purposes if installed by a third party. So, it's more of a cautionary warning than a malicious detection.\n\n**User:**\nI see. That makes sense. Another question I had was about verifying the signature of the downloaded Verus software package. Can I use any identity to verify the signature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". Therefore, you must use this specific identity to verify the signature of the downloaded package. This ensures that the package is genuine and comes from the Verus Coin Foundation, and not from some other source. Does that clarify things?",
