    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nBefore I start using the Verus software, I have some questions about the terms and conditions. What kind of warranty does the software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software comes with no warranty of any kind, express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. You should be aware of this before using the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Are the authors or copyright holders of the software liable for any claims or damages arising from the use of the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the authors or copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. You should understand that you use the software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that some antivirus software flags the Verus software as a virus. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAvast and Kaspersky do not flag the software as a virus. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is mining software and may be installed by a third party to exploit the user's PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not actually a virus. You can safely use the software without worrying about it being malware.",
