    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit concerned about the security of my transactions, especially with the advent of quantum computers. How can I upgrade my transactions sent to my identity name/address to be quantum secure, considering that each transaction needs to be individually updated?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI totally understand your concern! Actually, when quantum secure addresses become available, upgrading your identity name/address will retroactively secure all transactions sent to that address, regardless of how many there are. This means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address will automatically secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address, without needing to individually update each transaction. So, you don't have to worry about updating each transaction one by one.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great, but I'm still a bit worried. Will my transactions be lost or compromised if I upgrade my identity name/address to a quantum secure address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, upgrading your identity name/address to a quantum secure address will not result in the loss or compromise of your transactions. In fact, the upgrade will retroactively secure all transactions sent to that address, ensuring their security and integrity. You can rest assured that your transactions will be safe and secure after the upgrade.",
