    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a chain on Verus, but I have a few questions. How do I create a chain with more than 3 eras?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there's a limitation on the number of eras when creating a chain. You can only have a maximum of 3 eras. It's not possible to create a chain with more than 3 eras.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. What happens if I don't have VRSCTEST in my wallet when trying to create a chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou need to have VRSCTEST in your wallet to create a chain. If you don't have VRSCTEST, you won't be able to create a chain. Make sure you have the required amount of VRSCTEST in your wallet before attempting to create a chain.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. Can I create a chain with less than 500 blocks worth of notarizations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't create a chain with less than 500 blocks worth of notarizations. The minimum requirement is 500 blocks worth of notarizations. You'll need to meet this requirement before you can create a chain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I want to create a chain with a notarization reward less than 0.01 VRSCTEST per block?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can't create a chain with a notarization reward less than 0.01 VRSCTEST per block. The minimum notarization reward is 0.01 VRSCTEST per block. You'll need to set a reward of at least 0.01 VRSCTEST per block when creating your chain.",
