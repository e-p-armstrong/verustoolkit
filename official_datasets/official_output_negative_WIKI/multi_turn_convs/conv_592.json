    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to launch a new currency on the Verus network, but I'm not sure about the requirements. Can you explain why you need to fund a currency with at least 1000 VRSCTEST before sending a transaction to initiate a currency launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. To initiate a currency launch, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST, not 1000. Additionally, you need to have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD for the currency to launch successfully. Does that clarify things for you?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the correction! I have another question. If I send a command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, will I immediately receive GOLD in my wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. If you send a command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, the conversion will be parked until the token launches. After the launch, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST back, depending on the outcome of the launch. So, you won't receive GOLD immediately, but rather after the launch is complete.",
