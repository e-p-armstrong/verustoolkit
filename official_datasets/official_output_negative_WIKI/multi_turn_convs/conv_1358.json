    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in creating a blockchain on the Verus network. Can you tell me how to create a blockchain on the Verus network with a limit of 10 blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I have some good news for you! There is no limit on the number of blockchains that can be created and operate on the Verus network. The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. So, you can create as many blockchains as you need, without any restrictions!\n\n**User:**\nThat's really great to know! I have another question related to VerusIDs. Can I use a locked VerusID to revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. If you want to revoke an identity, you need to do so before locking it or use another ID with the necessary permissions to revoke it. It's an important aspect of identity management on the Verus network, and it's essential to plan ahead when working with locked identities. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or blockchain creation on the Verus network?",

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n## Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencycon",
