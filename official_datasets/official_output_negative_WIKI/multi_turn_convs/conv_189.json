    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about signatures. What is the result of a signature verification if the signature is invalid?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of a signature verification is `true` if the signature is valid, which implies that if the signature is invalid, the result would be `false`. Do you have any further questions about signature verification or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about the CLI upgrade v0.7.2-6. Is it mandatory?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the CLI upgrade v0.7.2-6 is non-mandatory. You don't need to upgrade if you don't want to. But keep in mind that newer versions often bring bug fixes, security patches, and new features, so it's usually a good idea to stay up to date. Do you have any other questions about this upgrade or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nI've been wondering about the differences between the mainnet and testnet in this release. What's the main difference?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe mainnet features are effectively unchanged from v0.7.2-4, while the testnet has several new improvements and updates, including the addition of the `getcurrencybalance` API, optimization of multi-currency operators and UTXO selection, and display of unlocked balance in `getwalletinfo`. The testnet is a great place to try out new features and test things before they make it to the mainnet. Do you have any other questions about the mainnet or testnet?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Will there be a testnet reset with this new release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, there is no testnet reset planned with this release. You can continue using the testnet as usual, and your testnet data will remain intact. If you have any more questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask!",
