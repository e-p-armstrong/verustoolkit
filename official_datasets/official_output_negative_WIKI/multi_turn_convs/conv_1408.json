    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble running `./verusd` on my Linux distro. I'm getting errors like `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` and `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory`. Do I really need to install the libgomp2 and zlib2g-dev libraries to fix this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you need to install libgomp1 and zlib1g-dev, not libgomp2 and zlib2g-dev. The correct command to run is `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`. That should fix the issue.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, is it normal to encounter this error message because all dependencies are installed by default on a Linux distro?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not normal to encounter this error message because all dependencies are installed by default. In fact, the error occurs because not all dependencies may be installed by default, and you need to install the libgomp1 and zlib1g-dev libraries to fix the issue.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Can I fix the error message by reinstalling `./verusd`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, reinstalling `./verusd` will not fix the error message. The error is caused by missing dependencies, specifically libgomp1 and zlib1g-dev, which need to be installed separately using `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`. Reinstalling `./verusd` won't solve the issue.",
