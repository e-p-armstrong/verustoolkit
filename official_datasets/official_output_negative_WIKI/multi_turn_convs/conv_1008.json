You should use it with caution and only for testing and development purposes.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. Are there any warranties or guarantees provided with this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, there are no warranties or guarantees provided with this software. In fact, the software is explicitly stated to be provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. You should use it at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the warning. Can I use this software for commercial purposes without obtaining permission or licenses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, yes, you can use this software for commercial purposes without obtaining permission or licenses.
