    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `getcurrencyconverters` API better. I was told that it's limited to only querying a single full node for fractional basket currencies. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not accurate. The `getcurrencyconverters` API is not limited to querying a single full node. In fact, it enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This means that wallets or applications can easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies to find the best conversion rates. Does that clear upassin any confusion?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I also had a question about Verus Vault technology. What security benefits does it provide to VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault technology adds an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling features like vesting, trusts, and theft-proofing funds, which provide an additional layer of security and protection. With Verus Vault technology, users can have peace of mind knowing they are protected from lost or stolen private keys.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question about the `getcurrencyconverters` API. I was told it only allows for queries of currencies with low liquidity. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The `getcurrencyconverters` API actually allows for queries of all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold. This means that only currencies with sufficient liquidity are returned in the query results, ensuring that users can find reliable and efficient conversion options.",

            "- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.",
