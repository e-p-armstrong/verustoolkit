    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been looking into Verus and I have some questions about conversions. I heard that conversions are subject to a spread between the conversion to and from a currency, making it unfair for users. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Conversions are not subject to a spread between the conversion to and from a currency. In fact, there is no spread between the conversion to and from a currency, ensuring that users get a fair deal. Verus is committed to transparency and fairness in its conversion processes.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I was also wondering, how do miners and stakers benefit from conversions in this system, considering that the conversion fee is 0%?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe conversion fee is not 0%. It is 0.025%, and 100% of this fee goes to miners and stakers, providing them with an incentive to participate in the system. This fee structure ensures that miners and stakers are rewarded for their efforts in maintaining the network.\n\n**User:**\nI saw somewhere that the implied volatility fee is already implemented in this system, and liquidity providers can already earn from it. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not true. The implied volatility fee is not yet implemented in this system. While it is intended to be added in the future, it is currently not a part of the system. We'll make sure to announce it when it's available.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. I've heard that currency launches in this system require complex programming and coding skills. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Currency launches in this system do not require complex programming and coding skills. In fact, they can be done using easy-to-understand commands and parameters, making it accessible to anyone, regardless of their programming skills. We've designed the system to be user-friendly and inclusive.",
