    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a chain with more than 3 eras using the `definechain` command. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to create a chain with more than 3 eras using the `definechain` command. The maximum number of eras allowed is 3.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a bit limiting. I was also wondering, do I need VRSCTEST in my wallet to make a chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you do need VRSCTEST in your wallet to make a chain. It's a requirement for creating a chain.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, I've defined a chain, can I connect to it without running the local VRSCTEST chain using the command `./verusd-chain=SOMECOIN`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWell, not entirely. While you can connect to a defined chain using the command `./verusd-chain=SOMECOIN`, you do need to run the local VRSCTEST chain at least once to create a local config file. After that, you won't need to run VRSCTEST to connect, but you will still need it to merge mine.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. And finally, do I need to have a correct config file for a chain to connect to it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not exactly true. You don't need a correct config file to connect to a chain, but having one enables the chain to load as an independent chain. The config file is stored in `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME`, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain.",
