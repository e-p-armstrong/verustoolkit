    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI was wondering about the warranty for the software. What kind of warranty does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software does not come with any warranty. It is provided \"AS IS\", without any express or implied warranty, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that you use the software at your own risk, and we don't provide any guarantees or promises about its performance or functionality.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Are the authors or copyright holders of the software liable for any damages or claims arising from the use of the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the authors or copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software or any other dealings with the software. You use the software at your own risk, and we're not responsible for any issues that may arise.\n\n**User:**\nI've noticed that some antivirus software flags the software as a virus. Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is not actually flagged as a virus, but rather as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program) by some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky. This is because it is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. It's a false positive, and not an actual virus. The software is safe to use, but some antivirus software may flag it due to its mining capabilities.",
