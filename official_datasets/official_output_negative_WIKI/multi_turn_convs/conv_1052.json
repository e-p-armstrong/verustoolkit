    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still learning about the Verus network, and I was wondering, why can't you launch a blockchain without a liquidity pool on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can launch a blockchain with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain on the Verus network. The bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n\n**User:**\nThat clears things up. I've also got a question about crowdfunding currency launches on the Verus network. How do you ensure that all participants in a crowdfunding currency launch will lose their funds if the minimum participation levels are not met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's not the case. If by the start time of the blockchain, the minimum participation levels are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. This ensures that participants are protected in case the minimum participation levels are not met.\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in the potential of the Verus network. Is the Verus network limited to only a few interoperable blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking. The possibilities are endless!",
