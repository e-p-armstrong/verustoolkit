    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with the `getcurrencyconverters` API. I'm trying to use it to retrieve all currencies that have less than 100 VRSC in reserve. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I have to clarify that the `getcurrencyconverters` API isn't designed to do what you're trying to do. According to the API's specifications, it only retrieves currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. So, it won't return currencies with less than 100 VRSC in reserve.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. I must have misunderstood the API's purpose. What is the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` API if it only returns currencies with a VRSC reserve ratio of exactly 10%?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! The `getcurrencyconverters` API doesn't only return currencies with a VRSC reserve ratio of exactly 10%. It returns currencies that have a VRSC reserve ratio greater than 10%. The API is designed to retrieve currencies that meet certain liquidity and reserve requirements.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have a market with only one currency, such as BTC?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getcurrencyconverters` API requires at least two currencies to be specified, such as BTC and ETH. It returns all currencies that have markets with both of the specified currencies at or above the liquidity threshold.",
