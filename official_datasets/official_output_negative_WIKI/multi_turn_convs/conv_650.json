    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating my own tokens or blockchains on Verus, but I've heard it requires programming knowledge. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true! Verus does not require users to have programming knowledge to create their own tokens or blockchains. In fact, Verus enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even a full-fledged blockchain without needing to know how to program. You can focus on your idea and creation without worrying about the technical details.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I've also been wondering about DeFi liquidity pools on Verus. I've read that they're not integrated into the consensus protocol. Is that correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's incorrect. Verus DeFi liquidity pools are integrated into the consensus protocol. This integration ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing issues like miner-extracted value (MEV) and front-running. The Verus DeFi protocol provides fee-based incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what about launching a new blockchain on Verus? Is it possible to do that without a corresponding liquidity pool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible to launch a new blockchain on Verus without a corresponding liquidity pool. According to Verus, the launch of a new blockchain is simultaneous with the launch of a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool as part of defining the new blockchain. This bridge converter currency has the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain.",
