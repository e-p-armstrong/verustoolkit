    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm curious about creating currencies on Verus. Is it possible to create a currency with any name I want, without needing a corresponding ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately not. To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\n\n**User:**\nSo, does that mean anyone can create a currency with a specific name, as long as they have an ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not exactly. Only the controller of the ID with the same name as the currency can create a currency with that name.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, is it possible to create multiple currencies with the same name, as long as they are controlled by different IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the controller of an ID can only create a currency of that name once. You can't have multiple currencies with the same name, even if they're controlled by different IDs.",
