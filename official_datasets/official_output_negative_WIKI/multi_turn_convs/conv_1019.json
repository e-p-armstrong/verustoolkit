    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm still learning about Verus and how it works. Can you help me with a question? What is the minimum number of eras required to define a chain in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there is no minimum number of eras required to define a chain in Verus. There is a maximum of 3 eras, but no minimum is specified. Do you have any more questions about chains or eras in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. Another question I have is, can I create a chain without having VRSCTEST in my wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot create a chain without having VRSCTEST in your wallet. VRSCTEST are needed in your wallet to make a chain. Without them, you won't be able to create a chain. Do you have any more questions about creating chains or VRSCTEST?\n\n**User:**\nGot it. Okay, so how do I connect to a defined chain using the command `./verusd-chain=SOMECOIN` without running the local VRSCTEST chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you do need to run the local VRSCTEST chain to connect to a defined chain using the command `./verusd-chain=SOMECOIN`. On first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect anymore. However, it will be needed to merge mine. So, while it's not needed after the initial connection, it is required at least once.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question, is the software provided under a proprietary license?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is not provided under a proprietary license. The software is provided under a permissive license that allows users to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software without restriction.
