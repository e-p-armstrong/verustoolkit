    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how fees are distributed in the Verus ecosystem. How do fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool on a new blockchain get distributed back to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool on a new blockchain are not distributed back to the Verus blockchain. Instead, they are earned on the new blockchain itself, with no \"rent\" or fees going back to the Verus blockchain. This allows for seamless connectivity between blockchains without any additional costs or fees. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about fees or the Verus ecosystem?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that Verus requires a minimum number of participants to launch a new blockchain. Is that true? If not, what happens to the launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's not entirely true. While Verus does provide the option to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in preferred currencies on the chain, if the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. This ensures that launches can still happen even if the minimum participation is not met. The launch isn't necessarily cancelled, but the participants are protected in case the minimum requirements aren't met. Does that clarify things?",
