    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been thinking about creating my own custom currency and I heard that Verus might be a good option. How do I program my own custom currency launch system using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you don't need to program your own custom currency launch system using Verus. Verus provides an easy-to-use system for launching currencies with various features such as Kickstarter-like minimums, dynamic pricing, and pre-launch participation discounts, all specified in easy-to-understand commands and parameters, without requiring any programming.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! Another question I had was, can Verus currencies only be launched to accept a single other currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus currencies can be launched to accept a range of other currencies. Additionally, they can be launched with or without fractional reserve capabilities.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been wondering about integrating Verus with other blockchains. Is it not possible to integrate Verus with other blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, it is possible to integrate Verus with other blockchains. Verus import/export protocol was designed to make integration with other blockchains provable and easy. In fact, there are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds very promising. I've heard about Verus' merge mining and multi-chain technology. Will it only allow two Verus network blockchains to operate independently and be dynamically merge mined?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology will allow Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mined along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question I had was about the testnet. Will the testnet coins/currencies retain their value even after VRSCTEST is reset?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset.",
