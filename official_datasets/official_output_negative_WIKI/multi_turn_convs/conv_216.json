    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI was going through some settings and I noticed the `OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER` option, which is set to 512. Can you tell me what the purpose of this option is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER` option is set to 1024, not 512. When this option is not set on a gateway, it means that top-level ID and currency registration happen on the launch chain. Would you like to know more about how this option affects the gateway's behavior?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the correction! I also saw the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` option, set to 2049. How does this option allow for multiple satoshi NFT tokens?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAnother mistake! The `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` option is actually set to 2048, not 2049. This option enables a single satoshi NFT token, which tokenizes control over the root ID. It does not allow for multiple satoshi NFT tokens. Would you like to know more about how NFT tokens work in Verus?",
