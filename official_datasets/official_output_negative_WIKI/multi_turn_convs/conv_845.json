    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a few more questions about chain definitions in Verus. Does a chain definition allow for a dynamic conversion price at launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a chain definition does not allow for a dynamic conversion price at launch. The conversion price is fixed at 100%, 1:1.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Another question I had was, can multiple payment addresses be specified for the premine in the chain definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the chain definition above only allows for a single payment address to be specified for the premine, which is \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\". There is no provision for specifying multiple payment addresses.",
