    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm using Verus and I'm wondering about some specific questions related to version v0.7.4. Is it possible to reduce the timelock period on a Verus Vault locked ID in this version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible to reduce the timelock period on a Verus Vault locked ID in version v0.7.4. In fact, this release fixes the issue that allowed the timelock period to be reduced, ensuring that the timelock period remains fixed and secure. So, you can rest assured that your timelock period will remain intact and secure.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I'm also planning to upgrade to version v0.7.4. Do I need to delete the vrsctest and .verustest/pbaas or VerusTest\\pbaas folders when upgrading?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you need to delete the vrsctest and .verustest/pbaas or VerusTest\\pbaas folders when upgrading to version v0.7.4. This is an important step to ensure a smooth and successful upgrade. Make sure to delete those folders before proceeding with the upgrade. If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
