    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and I'm still a bit unclear about some aspects. Can you help me understand how Verus's fee model puts the security of the blockchain at risk?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus's fee model, specifically the Verus Fee Pooling technology, doesn't put the security of the blockchain at risk. In fact, it strengthens blockchain security. This model preserves the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, addressing legitimate concerns about blockchain security.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also confused about Verus Vault. Is it a new cryptocurrency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault is not a new cryptocurrency. It's actually an advanced time-locking feature for identities on the Verus testnet. It provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management and enables various use cases such as trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, and estate planning.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about Verus Fee Pooling. How does it work? Does it take all the fees from transactions in a block and give them to the current block miner or staker?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not exactly how it works. With Verus Fee Pooling, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block and added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees. The current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool. This way, the fees are distributed more smoothly over time, which benefits the entire network.",

In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
