    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few questions about the latest upgrade. What's the purpose of a testnet fork for a mainnet upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere's actually no testnet fork for a mainnet upgrade. Instead, accessing a specific testnet version requires resetting the local testnet by deleting the relevant data folders. So, you won't need to worry about forking the testnet, but rather just reset it to access the desired version. Do you have any other questions about the upgrade or testnet?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. How does the new protocol upgrade affect the Verus Proof of Stake consensus algorithm?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the new protocol upgrade affects the Verus Proof of Power consensus algorithm, not the Verus Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. The upgrade changes some parameters of the Verus Proof of Power consensus algorithm, enabling smoother starts, restarts, and general operation of PBaaS chains, regardless of their native currency supply or emission schedule. So, it's specifically focused on improving the Proof of Power algorithm.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! One more question. Which Ethereum testnet is being used for the new Ethereum bridge and mapped currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Ethereum testnet being used is actually Goerli, not Rinkeby. They were previously using Rinkeby, but have switched to Goerli for this release. So, if you're working with the Ethereum bridge and mapped currencies, you'll want to make sure you're using the Goerli testnet.",

            "This update includes the first protocol release candidate for mainnet PBaaS, VerusID protocol upgrades, and Verus DeFi. In addition to some functional fixes and full web site support for mapped currencies and simple commands for mapping Verus currencies to any ERC20 currencies on Ethereum with provable, auditable 1:1 mapping and cross chain send/receive. In addition this new protocol upgrade changes some parameters of the Verus Proof of Power consensus algorithm, enabling smoother starts, restarts, and general operation of PBaaS chains, regardless of their native currency supply or emission schedule. As these consensus parameter changes would require either a testnet fork, which would not be relevant for the mainnet upgrade or a reset, accessing the v0.9.3 testnet requires that you reset your local testnet by deleting the vrsctest and pbaas data folders from the locations described below.As part of this release, we will be launching the new Ethereum bridge and enable full use of Ethereum mapped currencies on the Goerli Ethereum testnet (note that we were previously using Rinkeby). This makes it easy for any currency definition to become a fully decentralized, auditable stable coin, simply by mapping to DAI, USDT, USDC, or another stable coin on Ethereum. In addition, the new website for Metamask support and use from Ethereum now displays all mapped currency options, even those added when someone exports a currency definition to Ethereum, either as a mapped currency or for using any Verus or PBaaS currency as an ERC20.This release also resolves an issue with setting max preconversion amounts on currency launches and addresses a number of minor protocol issues found as a result of the active community testing support we are seeing on testnet.",
