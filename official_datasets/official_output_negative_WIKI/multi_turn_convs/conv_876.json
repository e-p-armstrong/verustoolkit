    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I heard about an issue in v0.9.9 that prevented parsing id@:private to the z-address of id@ when running a native node. Is that a minor issue?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, actually, it's considered a critical privacy issue. This is why the release of v0.9.9-5 is considered a critical privacy fix. It's essential to ensure the privacy and security of users, so this issue was taken very seriously.\n\n**User:**\nI've been looking into Verus and its capabilities. Can I launch independent, connected, interoperable blockchains with programming using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can launch independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming using Verus. Verus provides this capability as one of its additional features, making it easier for users to create and manage their own blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nI've been following the development of Verus, and I'm curious about the mainnet PBaaS upgrade. Will version 1.0.0 be released on a specific date?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, there is no specific date announced for the release of version 1.0.0. It is currently in progress, but no specific date is given. The development team is working hard to ensure that the upgrade meets the highest standards of quality and security, and it will be released when it's ready.",

Instead, such an address parsed to the main id@. Since this issue could impact on-chain privacy of someone intending to send to or from a private address and using friendly names, we are considering this a critical privacy release.This version also prevents the wallet from crediting transactions that can be constructed to make a burn look like a spendable output, ensuring that unspendable funds are not added to a wallet or address balance. @Alrighttt, who has been focusing on Verus security testing, reported a way that someone might create such an output, and we appreciate that it is before we have ever seen such transactions on the public or test networks. Thanks @Alrighttt for the report and discretion that helps keep them off the network(s) altogether! We recommend that everyone update as soon as possible to version 0.9.9-5 or later.We are working towards the mainnet PBaaS upgrade version 1.0.0, but we cannot put a specific date beyond \ud83d\udd1c on its release.### What\u2019s New for TestNet\nThis release fixes hopefully the last remaining issue that was causing testnet users to experience sync issues on PBaaS chains.There are no other significant changes.### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
