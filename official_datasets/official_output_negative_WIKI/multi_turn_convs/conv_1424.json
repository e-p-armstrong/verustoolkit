    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been following Verus for a while now, and I'm curious about the community's focus. Is the main focus of the Verus community convincing everyone of its capabilities or creating new things?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main focus of the Verus community is creation, rather than convincing everyone of its capabilities. The community has put its energy into building and making new things possible, rather than trying to persuade others of what they can do. We believe that the best way to showcase Verus' capabilities is by actually building and innovating, rather than just talking about it.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard a lot about VerusID. Is VerusID available only on the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusID is actually available on the mainnet, not just the testnet. It enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. This means that users can create and manage their identities in a fully decentralized and secure manner.\n\n**User:**\nAnother feature I'm curious about is Verus Vault. Does Verus Vault allow users to spend their funds while their identity is locked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault actually prevents users from spending their funds while their identity is locked. It enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. This provides an additional layer of security and control for users, giving them more peace of mind when managing their digital assets.",

            "As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today\u2019s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID\n- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.\n## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)\n- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user\u2019s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implement",
