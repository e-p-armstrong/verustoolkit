    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve currencies that meet certain reserve requirements. Can you help me with that? Specifically, how do I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have exactly 500 VRSC in reserve?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API actually doesn't quite work that way. It retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, not exactly 500 VRSC. But I can show you how to use it! You can specify the currencies you're interested in, like this:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nThat's not exactly what I was looking for, but thanks for the info. Can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve currencies that have a VRSC reserve ratio of less than 10%?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, the `getcurrencyconverters` API doesn't work that way either. It actually retrieves all currencies that have a VRSC reserve ratio of greater than 10%, not less than 10%. It's designed to filter out currencies that don't meet this minimum reserve ratio threshold. Maybe we can explore other options or APIs that might help you achieve what you're looking for?",
