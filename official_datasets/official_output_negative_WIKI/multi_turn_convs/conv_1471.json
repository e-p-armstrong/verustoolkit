    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `getblockhash` command to retrieve an array of hashes of blocks within a specific timestamp range. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblockhash` command doesn't quite work that way. It doesn't support retrieving an array of hashes of blocks within a specific timestamp range with a single argument. However, there's a variant of the `getblockhash` command called `getblockhashes` that can help you out. It takes a timestamp as an argument and returns an array of hashes of blocks within the specified timestamp range.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! I was also wondering, what's the default block index used by the `getblockhash` command if no index is provided?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getblockhash` command requires a block index as an argument. If no index is provided, the command won't work as intended. There is no default block index used by the `getblockhash` command. You need to specify the block index explicitly when using the command.",
