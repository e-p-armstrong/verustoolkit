    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `encryptwallet` command, but it's not working. Do I need to set something up first?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you're correct. The `encryptwallet` command doesn't work out of the box. It's actually disabled by default and requires some additional setup. You'll need to enable the `-experimentalfeatures` and `-developerencryptwallet` command-line options, or add the corresponding lines to your VRSC.conf file. Have you tried that?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was also wondering about importing private keys into my wallet. Can I use the `dumpprivkey` command to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not the right command for importing private keys. The `dumpprivkey` command is actually used to retrieve a private key from an address. If you want to import a private key into your wallet, you'll need to use the `importprivkey` command instead. Give that a try!",
