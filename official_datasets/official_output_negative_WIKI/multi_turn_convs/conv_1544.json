    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really excited about the Ethereum bridge. When will it be available on the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to update you on that. The Ethereum bridge is currently being worked on for the Verus testnet, not the mainnet. It is expected to be available on the testnet within the next day or two. Once it is up, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge at https://ethtest.verus.services.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the update! I'm also playing around with creating my own tokens using the `definecurrency` command. Can I use it to create a token with a maximum supply of 10 satoshis?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no. When creating a token with the `definecurrency` command, the max supply should be 1 satoshi, not 10 satoshis. This is a requirement for tokenizing ID control, which is a next-generation NFT feature. So, make sure to set the max supply to 1 satoshi when creating your token.",
