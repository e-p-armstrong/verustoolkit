    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to set up a solo-mining setup and I was wondering if I should use the Verus wallet for it. Is that a good idea?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, it's not recommended to use the Verus wallet (GUI and CLI) for solo-mining setups. The Verus wallet does a lot more than mining, and it's better suited for pool-mining. You might want to consider using a dedicated mining software for solo-mining instead.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I'm actually using NHEQMINER for my solo-mining setup. Can you explain how to configure the batch file to run on high priority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the instructions explain how to configure the batch file to run on low priority, not high priority. To do this, you need to adjust the `start.bat` file by adding `%windir%\\system32\\cmd.exe /c start \"NHEQminer VRSC\" /Low \"%THIS_DIR%\\nheqminer.exe\"` before the existing command. This will run the miner on low priority. If you need to run it on high priority, you'll need to modify the command accordingly. Do you have any other questions about configuring NHEQMINER or solo-mining with Verus?",
