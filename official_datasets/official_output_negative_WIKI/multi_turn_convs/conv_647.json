    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about transactions on the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. How do you execute transactions with the help of a central intermediary?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, transactions on the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace are executed directly, peer-to-peer, without the need for any intermediary. This is the beauty of the decentralized model of the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, where buyers and sellers can interact directly and execute transactions transparently and securely.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What about Verus Vault? Is it possible to spend funds from a VerusID that has been locked with Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible to spend funds from a VerusID that has been locked with Verus Vault. Once a VerusID is locked with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. However, you can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so.\n\n**User:**\nAnother question I had is about configuring revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities on a VerusID. Can you enable these capabilities without having a primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities on a VerusID without having a primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. According to the Verus documentation, it is important to note that these capabilities require you to have one primary identity, and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.",
