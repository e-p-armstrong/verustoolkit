    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to send a transaction using the `sendmany` command, but I'm not sure if I need to specify the addresses and amounts. Can I just use the command without specifying them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. You cannot send a transaction using the `sendmany` command without specifying the addresses and amounts. The `sendmany` command requires a JSON object with addresses and amounts, like `\"{\\\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\\\":0.01,\\\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\\\":0.02}\"`. Without this information, the command will not be valid. If you're unsure about the syntax, I can help you with that.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So what about the `sendtoaddress` command? Can I use that to send multiple amounts to multiple addresses at once?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `sendtoaddress` command is used to send a single amount to a single address. If you need to send multiple amounts to multiple addresses, you should use the `sendmany` command instead. The `sendtoaddress` command is designed for simple transactions, whereas `sendmany` is meant for more complex transactions involving multiple recipients. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
