    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into the `makeoffer` command and I'm not entirely sure how it works. Can you explain how it allows for centralized, trusted third-party atomic swaps of blockchain assets?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `makeoffer` command doesn't facilitate centralized, trusted third-party atomic swaps of blockchain assets. Instead, it enables completely decentralized, fully on-chain atomic swap offers for decentralized swapping of any blockchain asset, including currencies, NFTs, identities, contractual agreements, and rights transfers, or as bids for on-chain auctions of any blockchain asset(s).\n\n**User:**\nSo, if I want to use the `makeoffer` command, can I use it to send funds from any address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use the `makeoffer` command to send funds from any address. The `fromaddress` argument must be a valid VerusID or a wildcard address, such as `*`, `R*`, or `i*`.",
