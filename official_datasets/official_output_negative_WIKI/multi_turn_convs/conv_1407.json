    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the Verus CLI wallet, but I'm having some trouble. Is the Verus CLI wallet documentation still in development and not yet updated to the latest version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus CLI wallet documentation is already updated to version 1.2.2-4. You should be able to find the latest information you need there. In fact, there's a note that says \"UPDATED to v1.2.2-4\" next to the links to the Verusd options list and Verus command list, indicating that the documentation is up-to-date. If you're still having trouble, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to help!",
