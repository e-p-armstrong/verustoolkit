    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm about to install the Verus software, but I was wondering, is the software provided with a warranty?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. So, you should be aware that you're using the software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. I was also wondering, why are Avast and Kaspersky flagging the software as malware? I'm a bit concerned about security.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDon't worry, I can clarify that for you! Avast and Kaspersky are not flagging the software as malware. They are flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is mining software that may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive detection, and the software is not actually malware. You can rest assured that the software is safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification. One more question: Are the authors or copyright holders liable for any damages or other liability arising from the use of the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. So, you should be aware that you're using the software at your own risk, and the authors or copyright holders won't be responsible for any potential issues.",
