    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about VerusIDs and I'm a bit confused. I thought digital signatures were only available for corporations on the Verus Network. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Digital signatures are available for everyone on the Verus Network, not just corporations. In fact, the Verus ID protocol is designed to be fully decentralized and accessible to anyone, without the involvement of any corporation. Anyone can create a VerusID and use it to create digital signatures, regardless of their background or affiliation.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering, can Verus IDs only be used for a limited set of specific applications, like content signing and binary releases?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus IDs are not limited to just a few specific applications. Their use cases are vast and varied, including physical entry systems, workflow applications, new earning opportunities, and many more. The possibilities are endless, and the Verus Network encourages users to explore and develop new use cases. The flexibility and versatility of VerusIDs make them a powerful tool for a wide range of applications. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or their potential use cases?",

            "For example, using Verus ID signatures, it\u2019s possible for any journalist anywhere to sign photos, videos, and content, establish a reputation for authenticity, and counter the potential for deep-fakes to make the truth harder to find. Open source projects can now create their own identities and digitally sign their binary releases, ensuring that not only can a file be verified by hash as the one downloaded from a particular server, but by signature as the actual file initially signed by the developer or release engineer. Signatures also form the basis for any attestation of one party to the validity of another. In fact, there are so many applications for digital signatures, from things listed already, to physical entry systems, to workflow applications, to new earning opportunities that a full discussion of use cases would overwhelm these release notes.In any case, we are happy to release digital signatures for all, and we hope you enjoy using this new, simple capability, maybe even think of a new use case you\u2019d like to pursue yourself as a business opportunity on the Verus Network!# Verus ID\nVerus IDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system.
