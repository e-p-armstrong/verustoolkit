    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `kvupdate` command, and I was wondering, what is the minimum number of days that a key can be stored using this command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum number of days that a key can be stored using the `kvupdate` command is 1 day. Are you having any issues with the command or would you like more information on how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nAlso, can I use the `kvupdate` command on any type of chain, not just asset chains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `kvupdate` command is only available for asset chains, as stated in the documentation. It is not applicable to other types of chains. So, if you're working with a different type of chain, you won't be able to use this command.\n\n**User:**\nI was thinking, maybe I could use the `notaries` command to store a key-value pair instead?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `notaries` command is not used to store a key-value pair. It takes two arguments: `height` and `timestamp`, and its purpose is not related to storing key-value pairs. For that, you would use the `kvupdate` command. The `notaries` command has a different function, so it's not a suitable replacement for storing key-value pairs.",
