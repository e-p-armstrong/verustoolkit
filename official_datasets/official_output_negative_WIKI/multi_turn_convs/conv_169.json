    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about Verus. Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky detect Verus as a virus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAvast and Kaspersky do not detect Verus as a virus. They may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software includes mining capabilities that could be used by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and Verus is not a virus. It's just a precautionary measure taken by the antivirus software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I've also been wondering, is VerusID just an ID system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not just an ID system. They are a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides opportunities for identity applications. They are decentralized, meaning there is no corporation involved in the protocol, and they offer features like quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses, revocability, recoverability, and more. VerusIDs are a much more comprehensive solution than just a simple ID system.\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the history of Verus, and I was wondering, was VerusID introduced at block 1000 of the Verus mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusID was introduced at block 800200 of the Verus mainnet, as part of an update to the mainnet protocol. This update brought several improvements, including an improved staking check. So, it was a bit later in the development of Verus, but it was an important milestone in the evolution of the platform.",
