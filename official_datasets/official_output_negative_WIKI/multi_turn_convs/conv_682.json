    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to set up a PBaaS blockchain, and I'm a bit confused about the `nodes` section. Why do I need to define it, since it's not used anywhere?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `nodes` section is necessary when defining a PBaaS blockchain. It specifies the network addresses and identities of the nodes that make up the blockchain. This is crucial information for the blockchain's operation.\n\n**User:**\nWait, I thought it was just filler information. But if it's necessary, what's the purpose of specifying the nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `nodes` section serves a critical role in the blockchain's operation. It provides the network addresses and identities of the nodes that make up the blockchain, which is essential for the blockchain to function properly. Without this information, the blockchain wouldn't know how to communicate with its nodes, and it wouldn't be able to operate.\n\nSo, even though it might seem like unnecessary information, the `nodes` section is actually a vital component of defining a PBaaS blockchain.",
