    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm ready to start using Verus. What's the command to launch the mainnet of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the command I can provide is for the testnet, not the mainnet. The command to launch the testnet of Verus is `./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST`. I don't have information on launching the mainnet. Are you sure you want to start with mainnet and not testnet?\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification. I was also wondering, is Verus software provided with a warranty?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. You should be aware of this before using the software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. Can I use Verus software for any purpose without any restrictions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAlmost. You can use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, but you must include the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. Just keep that in mind when using Verus software.",
