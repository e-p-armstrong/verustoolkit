    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got another question. You mentioned earlier that VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another ID if specified. How do VerusIDs require a central authority to revoke and recover an ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some misunderstanding. VerusIDs do not require a central authority to revoke and recover an ID. In fact, VerusIDs are a fully decentralized protocol, and users have complete control over their IDs. They can choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID, enabling a virtually theft-proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering, are VerusIDs limited to being used only on Verus PBaaS blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not limited to being used only on Verus PBaaS blockchains. The VerusID protocol can also be implemented on non-Verus systems. Additionally, IDs can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. This makes VerusIDs quite versatile and widely applicable. Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or their usage?",
