    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand how to use the `definecurrency` command in Verus. Specifically, I'm wondering about the `proofprotocol` option. What's the purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to a specific value in the `definecurrency` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `proofprotocol` option in the `definecurrency` command is used to specify the protocol for proof of ownership or control. In this case, setting `proofprotocol` to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID, allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But what if I'm not the controller of the chain ID? How do I mint new coins in \"mycoin\" in that case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't mint new coins in \"mycoin\" if you're not the controller of the chain ID. The `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID, meaning only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. You would need to be the controller of the chain ID or have permission from the controller to mint new coins.",
