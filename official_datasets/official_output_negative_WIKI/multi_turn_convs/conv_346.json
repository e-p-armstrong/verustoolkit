    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand how the `listreceivedbyaddress` command works. Can you explain how it returns only transactions to watchonly addresses by default?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. The `listreceivedbyaddress` command does not return only transactions to watchonly addresses by default. In fact, it does not include them by default. To include watchonly addresses, you need to specify `true` as the second argument, like this: `verus listreceivedbyaddress 6 true`. Would you like to know more about using this command?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I also have a question about the `listsinceblock` command. How do I use it to get all transactions in blocks since a specific block hash, without requiring any confirmations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can't actually use the `listsinceblock` command to get all transactions in blocks since a specific block hash without requiring any confirmations. The `target-confirmations` argument is optional, but if specified, it must be 1 or more. If you omit it, the command will still require at least 1 confirmation. So, unfortunately, it's not possible to use this command to get unconfirmed transactions.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question about the `listreceivedbyaddress` command. What is the purpose of the `account` field in the result of the command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `account` field in the result of the `listreceivedbyaddress` command is actually deprecated and should not be used. It is not a reliable or useful piece of information, and it will always be an empty string (`\"\"`), which is the default account. So, you can safely ignore this field. Do you have any more questions about these commands or Verus in general?",
