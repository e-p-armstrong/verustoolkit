    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been digging into the Verus software and I had a few questions about the legal aspects of using it. What kind of warranty does the software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software does not come with any warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. It's important to understand that you're using the software at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering, are the authors or copyright holders of the software liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the authors or copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise. You should be aware that you're responsible for your own actions when using the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've had an issue with my antivirus software flagging the Verus software as a virus. Can you explain why that might be happening?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think I can help with that. Avast and Kaspersky do not flag the software as a virus. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program), which is a warning that the software is mining software that may be installed by a third party to exploit the user's PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not actually malware. It's just a misclassification by the antivirus software.",
