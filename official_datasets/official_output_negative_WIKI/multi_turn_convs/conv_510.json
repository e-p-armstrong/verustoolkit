    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and I'm wondering how it handles transactions between buyers and sellers. Does it allow for intermediaries to control these transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace does the opposite. It enables transactions to be executed directly, peer-to-peer, without any intermediary necessary. This is a key feature of the marketplace, allowing for complete decentralization and self-sovereignty. There's no need for a middleman, giving buyers and sellers full control over their transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear. I'm also interested in using Verus Vault to secure my funds. If I lock my VerusID with Vault, can I still spend funds from that identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot spend funds from a VerusID that has been locked with Verus Vault. Once you lock your identity with Vault, you won't be able to spend funds from that identity until it's unlocked again. However, you can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network to earn rewards.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. And finally, I was wondering if I can use Verus Vault without setting up a primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not possible. To enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities, you must have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This is a necessary requirement to use Verus Vault to protect your funds.",
