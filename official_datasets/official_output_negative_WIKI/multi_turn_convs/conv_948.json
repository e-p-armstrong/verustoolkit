    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus PBaaS, and I'm not sure if it's just another decentralized platform. Is Verus PBaaS just a decentralized platform like many others in the crypto space?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today's decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways. It provides unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all, and has unique features such as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities and staking-capable time locking and theft prevention. So, while it's decentralized, it's got some key differentiators that set it apart from other platforms.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting! I've also heard about VerusIDs. Are VerusIDs only available on the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are currently available on the mainnet. They enable permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. So, you can start using them right away on the mainnet!\n\n**User:**\nAnother thing I've been wondering about is Verus Vault. Does Verus Vault only allow for time locking of identities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault enables not only time locking of identities but also staking-capable time locking and theft prevention. This allows identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. It's a really powerful feature that adds an extra layer of security and control to VerusIDs.",

If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID\n- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.\n## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)\n- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user\u2019s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implement",
