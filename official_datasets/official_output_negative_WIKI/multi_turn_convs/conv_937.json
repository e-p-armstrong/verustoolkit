    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about creating tokens and blockchains on the Verus network. Do users need to have programming knowledge to create their own decentralized tokens and blockchains on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, users don't need programming knowledge to create their own decentralized tokens and blockchains on the Verus network. The Verus network enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain without requiring any programming knowledge. It's designed to be accessible to everyone!\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great. I've also been wondering about PBaaS chains. Are they run from separate daemons, one for each project?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, PBaaS chains do not run from separate daemons, one for each project. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. This makes it easier to maintain and update the chains.\n\n**User:**\nI've been looking into DeFi liquidity pools on the Verus network. Do they allow for miner-extracted value (MEV) and front-running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner-extracted value (MEV) and front-running. This is achieved by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Can bridge converter currencies be launched independently of a new blockchain launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, bridge converter currencies are bound to the launch of a new blockchain and run on the new blockchain. They cannot be launched independently of a new blockchain launch.",
