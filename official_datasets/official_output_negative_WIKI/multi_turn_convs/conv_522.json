    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about launching a currency on Verus. So, how do I initiate a currency launch immediately after sending the transaction returned from the command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't initiate a currency launch immediately after sending the transaction returned from the command. The currency launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction was made (by default). This is because the mining process is what triggers the launch, and it takes some time for the blocks to be mined. So, you'll have to wait a bit for the launch to happen.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Another question: Can I create new tokens without a centralized issuance option after a currency has launched?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrently, the only way to create new tokens after a currency has launched is with a centralized issuance option. There is no decentralized way to create new tokens at this time. So, if you want to create new tokens, you'll need to use a centralized option.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question: If I send the command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, will I get 1 GOLD for every 1 VRSCTEST I convert?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. If you send the command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, you will get 0.975 GOLD for every 1 VRSCTEST you convert, not 1 GOLD for 1 VRSCTEST. So, keep that conversion rate in mind when making the conversion.",
