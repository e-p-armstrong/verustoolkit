    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the Verus network and I'm a bit confused about something. I thought I heard that the launch of a new blockchain on the Verus network requires permission from a central authority. Can you explain why that's the case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception! The launch of a new blockchain on the Verus network does not require permission from a central authority. The Verus network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, and these launches can be done in a fully decentralized manner, without the need for permission from a central authority. The Verus network is designed to be permissionless and open, allowing anyone to create and launch their own blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I was also wondering, how do the fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool get distributed back to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool do not get distributed back to the Verus blockchain. Instead, all fees earned are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This is one of the key features of the Verus network, providing seamless connectivity between blockchains without any underlying fees. The Verus network is designed to be a decentralized and open platform, where each blockchain is independent and self-sustaining.",

The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants.
