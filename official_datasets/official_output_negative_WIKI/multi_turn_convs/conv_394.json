    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about verifying downloads. How do I verify a download without using the provided txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't. The txt file is necessary for verifying the download. The file contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, which are used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the download. Without this file, you won't be able to verify the download. It's essential to have this file to ensure the download is genuine and hasn't been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Thanks for clarifying that. I also had a question about the recent release of v0.9.3. Is the release of v0.9.3 mandatory for mainnet users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the release of v0.9.3 is not mandatory for mainnet users. It is only mandatory for testnet users. Mainnet users can continue to use previous versions without issues. So, you don't need to upgrade to v0.9.3 if you're a mainnet user.",
