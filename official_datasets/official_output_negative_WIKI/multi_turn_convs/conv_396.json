    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about creating currencies on Verus. Can anyone create a currency with any name they want, without needing an ID of the same name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not the case. To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, I was thinking, what if I want to create multiple currencies with the same name, like gold@, using different IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't. The controller of an ID can only create a currency of that name once. Once a currency is created with a specific name, no one can create another currency with the same name, even if they have a different ID.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question about creating currencies: is it possible to launch a currency without defining it using the `definecurrency` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible to launch a currency without defining it using the `definecurrency` command. The `definecurrency` command is necessary to define the properties of the currency, such as its name, options, and conversions. Without defining the currency, it cannot be launched.",
