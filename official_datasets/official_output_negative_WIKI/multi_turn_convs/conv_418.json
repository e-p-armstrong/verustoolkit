    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few questions about using Verus. How do I register an identity on the Verus network without needing to provide a parent identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, a parent identity is required when registering an identity on the Verus network. In the example provided, the parent identity is specified as \"i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt\" and \"vrsc-btc@\". You can't register an identity without providing a parent identity. Do you have any other questions about registering identities on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also got a question about the `registeridentity` command. What is the purpose of the `returntx` flag in that command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `returntx` flag is used to return a raw transaction for manual signing, typically when a currency's ID issuance requires permission from the currency's identity. It's a useful option to have in certain scenarios. Do you have any experience with the `registeridentity` command, or would you like more information on how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nI've got a more general question about Verus. Can Verus only launch tokens and currencies on-chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus is capable of more than just launching tokens and currencies on-chain. Verus also supports on-chain launches of Liquidity Basket AMMs, as well as on-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming. Additionally, Verus supports on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles. Verus is a very versatile platform! Do you have any other questions about what Verus can do?",
