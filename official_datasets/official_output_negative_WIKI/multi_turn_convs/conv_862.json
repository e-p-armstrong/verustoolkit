    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in learning more about Verus PBaaS Reserve technology. I've heard that organizations need to pay a significant upfront cost to create their own fractional reserve currency on a separate blockchain using this technology. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a common misconception. With Verus PBaaS Reserve technology, organizations don't need to pay any upfront costs beyond public blockchain network fees to create their own fractional reserve currency on an independent blockchain. This means that there are no significant upfront costs involved in creating a new currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know. I also had a question about the fees involved in conversions between currencies on an organization's new chain. What happens to the 0.01% fees for these conversions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe 0.01% fees for conversions between currencies on an organization's new chain go directly to the miners and stakers of that organization's new chain. These miners and stakers also have the option to merge mine up to 14 other blockchains and coins while mining their own project, improving efficiency, profitability, and shared liquidity for everyone involved.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. I've heard that the Verus Reserve protocol connects multiple blockchains into a single, unified blockchain. Can you explain why it does that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not entirely accurate. The Verus Reserve protocol does not connect multiple blockchains into a single, unified blockchain. Instead, each blockchain is independent and connected through the Verus Reserve protocol, allowing for cross-chain interoperability. This means that each blockchain remains separate and independent, but can still interact and interoperate with other blockchains.",
