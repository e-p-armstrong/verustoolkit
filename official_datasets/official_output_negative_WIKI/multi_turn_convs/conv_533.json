    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and I'm wondering, how do I use them to execute transactions through a centralized authority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not how Verus ID and NFT Marketplace work. They're designed to execute transactions in a completely decentralized way, without any intermediary necessary. You can buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed directly, peer-to-peer, without the need for a centralized authority. This gives you more control and flexibility over your transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also been looking into Verus Vault, and I was wondering, can I use it to spend funds from a locked VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot. If you lock your VerusID with Verus Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network to earn rewards, but you cannot spend them. This is an added layer of security and protection for your assets.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And one more question about Verus Vault: is it possible to use it without having a primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it is not possible. Enabling revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities requires you to have one primary identity, and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This is necessary for the security and flexibility features of Verus Vault to function properly.",
