    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there! I've got a few questions about Verus. I've heard that Verus doesn't support multi-signature IDs for signing transactions on the mainnet. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception! Verus does support multi-signature IDs for signing transactions on both testnet and mainnet. The process involves creating a transaction, getting the raw transaction data, taking it to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs, signing it with `verus signrawtransaction`, and then broadcasting it on the network with `verus sendrawtransaction`. So, you can definitely use multi-signature IDs on the mainnet.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I was also wondering, is the Verus testnet a limited, centralized blockchain platform?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not at all! The Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform. It allows for an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains, and is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets. So, you have all the features and flexibility you need to test and experiment with Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds awesome! I've heard that creating a new identity or currency on the Verus testnet requires programming knowledge, though. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not the case! You don't need programming knowledge to create a new identity or currency on the Verus testnet. With the easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions, you can create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming. Verus is designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background.",
