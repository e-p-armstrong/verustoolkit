    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few more questions about Verus and its capabilities. What is the maximum number of blockchains that can operate simultaneously on the k network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe k network is actually designed to be fractal, which means that there is no maximum number of blockchains that can operate simultaneously. This allows for an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really powerful. I also had a question about locked identities. Can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. The revocation authority is typically separate from the identity itself, and is designed to provide an additional layer of security and control.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a locked identity when its flags are set back to an unlocked state?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the flags of a locked identity are set back to an unlocked state, there is a time delay before the identity is unlocked. This time delay is defined by the timelock parameter. This ensures that there's a buffer period before the identity can be used again, adding an extra layer of security to the process.",
