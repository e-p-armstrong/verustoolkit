    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few more questions about how Verus works. Is it possible to have only one blockchain operating on the Verus network at a time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it is not the case that only one blockchain can operate on the Verus network at a time. In fact, there is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. The Verus blockchain network model is fractal, allowing for an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if I try to revoke a locked identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRevoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. A locked identity cannot revoke itself, but it can be revoked by another entity with the necessary permissions.\n\n**User:**\nI've also got a question about the API. Will the `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieve all currencies, regardless of their reserve ratio or liquidity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getcurrencyconverters` API does not retrieve all currencies. It only retrieves currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example, the command `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
