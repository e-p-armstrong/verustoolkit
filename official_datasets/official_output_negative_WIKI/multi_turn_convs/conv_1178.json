    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to use the `currencyconverters` API to retrieve some specific currencies. Can I use it to retrieve all currencies that have less than 1000 VRSC in reserve?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `currencyconverters` API doesn't work that way. It only retrieves currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. So, unfortunately, you won't be able to use it to get currencies with less than 1000 VRSC in reserve.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. What about retrieving currencies that have a VRSC reserve ratio of less than 10%? Can I use the `currencyconverters` API for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `currencyconverters` API only retrieves currencies that have a VRSC reserve ratio of greater than 10%. It doesn't return currencies with a reserve ratio of less than 10%. So, if you're looking for currencies with a low reserve ratio, you'll need to look elsewhere.",
