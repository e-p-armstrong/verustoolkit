    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with the `getbalance` command. I want to know how to use it to get the balance of a specific address in my wallet. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getbalance` command actually returns the total amount in the wallet, not the balance of a specific address. To get the balance of a specific address, you should use the `getcurrencybalance` command instead. For example, to get the total amount received by address \"myaddress\", you can use `verus getcurrencybalance \"myaddress\"`. Would you like more information on using `getcurrencybalance`?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I have another question. Can I use the `getnewaddress` command to get a new identity address for receiving payments?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getnewaddress` command returns a new VRSC address for receiving payments, not an identity address. If you need to create an identity address, you should use a different command or method. Let me know if you'd like more information on creating identity addresses or anything else related to Verus!",
