    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm playing around with VRSCTEST and I was wondering, what's the value of testnet coins/currencies, and what happens to them when VRSCTEST is reset?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTestnet coins/currencies have no value, and they will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. This is a warning to users to not assign any value to these testnet coins, as they are only for testing purposes and will be lost when the testnet is reset. So, don't get too attached to them!\n\n**User:**\nI'm also trying out the `sendcurrency` API. Can I use it to send funds from a single address to a single recipient without specifying the amount?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use the `sendcurrency` API to send funds without specifying the amount. The `sendcurrency` API requires you to specify the amount of currency to be sent, as shown in the examples provided. You'll need to specify the amount you want to send, otherwise, the API won't work as intended.",
