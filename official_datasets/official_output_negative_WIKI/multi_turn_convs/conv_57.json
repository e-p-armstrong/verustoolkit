    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I need some help with the `sendcurrency` API. How do I send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the `sendcurrency` API, and convert it to a reserve currency like USD at the same time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't convert VRSCTEST to a reserve currency like USD directly when sending it from a single address to a single recipient. However, you can send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the `sendcurrency` API, and then convert it to a fractional basket currency, like VRSC-BTC, which can later be converted to a reserve currency like BTC.\n\nHere's an example of sending VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nAnd here's an example of converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nWould you like me to clarify anything about these examples or help with something else?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I have another question. Do testnet coins/currencies have value and will they persist even after VRSCTEST is reset?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. They're meant for testing and development purposes only, so don't worry about losing any real value when the testnet is reset. Is there anything else I can help you with?",
