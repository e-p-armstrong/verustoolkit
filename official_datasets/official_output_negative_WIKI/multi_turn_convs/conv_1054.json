    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've noticed that when I download and run the Verus installer, I don't get any virus detection warnings from my antivirus software, like Avast and Kaspersky. Is that normal?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus installers may flag warnings from antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky, specifically \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" warnings. These warnings are not indicating that the software is malware, but rather that it is mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. It's just a precautionary measure taken by the antivirus software.\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with Verus, and I'm wondering if the software is fully stable and production-ready?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus software is not fully stable and production-ready. In fact, it is explicitly stated to be \"experimental and unfinished software\" and users are warned to \"use at your own risk\" with \"no warranty for any kind of damage\". So, be aware that you're using it at your own risk, and there might be some bugs or issues.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about restrictions on using or modifying the Verus software? Are there any?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, there are no restrictions on using or modifying the Verus software. The software is provided with a permissive license that grants users the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the condition that the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
