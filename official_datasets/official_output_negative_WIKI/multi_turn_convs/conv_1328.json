    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to send some VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@) on the mainnet. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the command you're thinking of is for the testnet, not the mainnet. But I can help you with that! To send VRSCTEST on the testnet, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nJust a heads up, testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification! Can I use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST from a single address to multiple recipients on the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAgain, the command you're thinking of is for the testnet, not the mainnet. However, on the testnet, you can use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST from a single address to multiple recipients. The correct command would be similar to:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"charlie@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nJust to reiterate, testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset.",
