    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few questions about using Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. How do I use Verus ID and NFT Marketplace to execute transactions through a centralized intermediary?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you don't use a centralized intermediary at all. Verus ID and NFT Marketplace allows you to execute transactions in a completely decentralized way, directly peer-to-peer, without any intermediary necessary. You can buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I also have a question about Verus Vault. Can I spend funds from a VerusID that's locked with Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot. If you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. However, you can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network to earn rewards.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. I also had a question about configuring identities. Do I need to have multiple identities configured to enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need multiple identities. You only need to have one primary identity, and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured to enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities.",
