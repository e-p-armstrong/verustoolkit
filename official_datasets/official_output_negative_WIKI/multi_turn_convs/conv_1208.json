    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there, I'm having some trouble with importing a native wallet backup in Verus Desktop. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo import a native wallet backup in Verus Desktop, click on \"Import native wallet backup\" in the settings, then browse to your backup file, select it, and click \"Open\" and then \"Import\" to start the import process. That should do the trick!\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks! I also have an Agama wallet and I'm wondering, can I import a wallet backup in Agama by clicking on the \"Import wallet\" button in the settings?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, you can't. To import a wallet backup in Agama, you need to go to the settings, scroll to the bottom, click on CLI, select VRSC in that section, and then type `z_importwallet \"<PATH><mywalletimport>\"` and click the button below to run it. It's a bit more involved, but it should work!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Is there a single command to import a wallet backup in all platforms, including Windows, Linux, and MacOS?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, there isn't. While the command `z_importwallet \"<PATH><mywalletimport>\"` is used in Agama and in Linux/MacOS CLI, in Windows CLI, you need to use `verus z_importwallet \\\"<PATH><mywalletimport>\\\"` instead. So, you'll need to use the appropriate command depending on your platform.",
