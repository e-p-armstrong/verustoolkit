    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about the `getcurrencystate` command. Can you explain why it's only available for the current block and not for specific blocks or ranges of blocks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misunderstanding! The `getcurrencystate` command is actually available for specific blocks and ranges of blocks, not just the current block. You can use the command with the block number, start and end block numbers, and step size to get the currency state for a specific block or range of blocks. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\nor\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```\nYou can try it out and see for yourself! Do you have any other questions about the `getcurrencystate` command?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know, thanks for the clarification! I also had a question about the software warranty. Is the software provided with a warranty that guarantees it will work as expected?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, the software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The disclaimer explicitly states that there is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the authors or copyright holders will not be liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. It's essential to understand this before using the software. Do you have any other questions about the software or its usage?",
