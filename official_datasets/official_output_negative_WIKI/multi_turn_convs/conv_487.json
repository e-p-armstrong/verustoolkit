    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating my own custom currency using Verus. How do I program my own custom currency launch parameters using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! But, you don't need to program anything to launch a currency with Verus. The platform provides easy-to-understand commands and parameters to specify the launch parameters, including minimums, pricing, and participation discounts. No programming is necessary. You can simply use the provided commands and parameters to set up your custom currency. Would you like me to explain more about the available parameters?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! Are Verus currencies limited to only accepting Verus tokens?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus currencies can be launched to accept a range of other currencies, not just Verus tokens. Additionally, the Verus import/export protocol is designed to make integration with other blockchains easy and provable, and there are already external bridges in progress to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens. This means you can create a currency that accepts multiple forms of payment. Do you have any other questions about Verus currencies?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the Verus 0.7.1 testnet. Can I use it to dynamically merge mine multiple Verus network blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus 0.7.1 testnet is only for on-chain token currency definition. The dynamic merge mining and multi-chain technology is a separate feature that was tested on a previous testnet and will be available soon. This feature will allow Verus network chains to operate independently yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash. You'll have to wait for the next release to try out this feature. Do you have any other questions about Verus or its features?",
