    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to launch a new currency on Verus, but I'm a bit stuck. Can you explain why I need to fund my currency with 1000 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there's a slight misunderstanding. You don't actually need to fund your currency with 1000 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch. Instead, you need to preconvert at least 1000 VRSCTEST to GOLD at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch the currency. Additionally, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction. That should help clarify things!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. So, what about creating new tokens after the GOLD token launches? How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWell, after the GOLD token launches, the only way to create new tokens at present is not through a decentralized process, but rather through a centralized issuance option. This is in contrast to the initial launch process, which is decentralized and incentivized through the mining process.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What if I don't have enough VRSCTEST to convert to GOLD after the GOLD token launches? What happens then?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't have enough VRSCTEST to convert to GOLD after the GOLD token launches, you won't receive any GOLD tokens. However, if you previously sent a conversion transaction with the command `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'`, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back, depending on whether the token launch was successful.",
