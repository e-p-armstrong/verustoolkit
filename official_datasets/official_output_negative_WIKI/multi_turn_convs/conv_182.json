    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about Verus PBaaS. How does it restrict users from creating their own identities and funds addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus PBaaS doesn't restrict users from creating their own identities and funds addresses. In fact, VerusID enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. Anyone can create their own identities and funds addresses without needing permission from a central authority.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also been curious about Verus Vault. What are the security features of Verus Vault, and how does it protect identities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a secure way to lock and protect identities. It enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. The lock can be set with an unlock delay, and the only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. This enables a virtually theft-proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really secure. One more question: Are VerusIDs only limited to being used on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not limited to being used only on the Verus network. IDs can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network, and potentially beyond. They're designed to be flexible and usable across different networks and applications.",
