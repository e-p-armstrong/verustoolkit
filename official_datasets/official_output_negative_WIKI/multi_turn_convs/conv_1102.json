    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been wondering about how transactions work on the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. Do you need a third-party intermediary to execute transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, you don't need a third-party intermediary to execute transactions on the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. The platform allows for completely decentralized transactions, executing peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. You can buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. This way, you have full control over your transactions and assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I've also been wondering about Verus Vault. Is it possible to spend funds from a VerusID that is locked with Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, if you lock your VerusID with Verus Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is unlocked again. However, you can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network to earn rewards. This adds an extra layer of security to your assets, while still allowing you to benefit from staking.",
