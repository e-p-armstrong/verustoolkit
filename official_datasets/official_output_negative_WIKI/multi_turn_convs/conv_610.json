    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a few more questions about VerusIDs. Can you explain why a locked VerusID cannot be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, a locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. This provides an additional layer of security and allows for decentralized funds recovery. Would you like to know more about how this works?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know. I was also wondering, does Verus Vault only provide security for funds, but not for IDs and NFTs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault provides security not only for funds but also for IDs and NFTs. It offers a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized recovery for all these assets. So, you can rest assured that your IDs and NFTs are protected as well.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really reassuring. One more question: Can you export an ID to a PBaaS chain without using the `sendcurrency` command with the `exportto` and `exportid` options?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, to export an ID to a PBaaS chain, you need to use the `sendcurrency` command with the `exportto` and `exportid` options, as shown in the example: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'`. This is the correct way to export an ID to a PBaaS chain. Do you have any more questions about Verus or VerusIDs?",
