    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have a few questions about VerusIDs and currencies. Can I create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name without any issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name without any issues. This is because the protocol does not prevent making an ID with an i-address as its name, but it will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used. The advice is to avoid doing this to prevent user confusion.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification. Another question: Can I use the same named currencies as a PBaaS chain in the Verus Desktop, even if they are already supported currencies like BTC or ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use the same named currencies as a PBaaS chain in the Verus Desktop if they are already supported currencies like BTC or ETH. This is a limitation in the current testnet release, but it will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been wondering, do I need to delete any directories after updating to the new testnet release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, if you have last launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this, you need to delete the following directories before running this new update: `~/.komodo/vrsctest` on Linux, `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest` on MacOS, and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` on Windows.",
