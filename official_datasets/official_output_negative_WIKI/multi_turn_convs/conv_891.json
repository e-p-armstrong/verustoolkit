    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use Verus to send reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and convert it to native currency at a fixed price that I specify. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to help! However, I have to correct you - you can't specify a fixed price for the conversion. When sending reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting it to native currency, the conversion happens at the current price.\n\nYou can use the following command to achieve this:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{\"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```\nThe `tonative` flag indicates that the amount should be converted to native currency at the current price.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! Can I also get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for a random block?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for a random block. However, you can get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block using:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate\n```\nOr, you can specify a specific block number or a range of blocks with a specific period between them to get the currency statistics for those blocks.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question - how do I refund contributions made to a successful PbaaS chain launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou don't refund contributions made to a successful PbaaS chain launch. The `refundfailedlaunch` command is used to refund contributions made to a **failed** PbaaS chain launch:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME\n```\nThis command is used to refund contributions when a PbaaS chain launch fails.",
