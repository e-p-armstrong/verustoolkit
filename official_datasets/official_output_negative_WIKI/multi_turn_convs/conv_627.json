    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about VerusIDs and I'm curious about how to create one without full control over it. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are designed to be fully self-sovereign, meaning that when you create an ID, you have complete control over it. There is no way to create a VerusID without full control over it, as this would contradict the fundamental principles of self-sovereignty and decentralization. VerusIDs are meant to give users full control over their digital identity and assets, and creating one without full control would go against that philosophy.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But what if someone steals my VerusID private keys and tries to spend my funds while my ID is locked with Verus Vault? Can they still access my funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf someone steals your VerusID private keys and tries to spend your funds while your ID is locked with Verus Vault, they will not be able to do so. The lock feature prevents any funds under the ID's control from being spent while locked. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover the ID, which would require the revocation authority and recovery authority, respectively. So, even if someone steals your private keys, they won't be able to access your funds if your ID is locked with Verus Vault.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been thinking about creating my own token currency or blockchain on the Verus network. Is it possible to create a token or blockchain that is not decentralized?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus network enables users to create their own decentralized tokens and blockchains. Users can create their own multi-currency, user-created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming. There is no option to create a non-decentralized token or blockchain on the Verus network. Decentralization is a core principle of the Verus ecosystem, and all creations on the network must adhere to that principle.",
