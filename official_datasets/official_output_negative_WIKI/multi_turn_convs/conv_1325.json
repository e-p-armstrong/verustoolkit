    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some configuration questions about `verusd`. What is the default value of the `-txconfirmtarget` option, and how does it affect transaction confirmation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default value of the `-txconfirmtarget` option is actually 2, not 0. When set, this option includes enough fee so transactions begin confirmation on average within the specified number of blocks (in this case, 2 blocks). Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! I've also got a question about the `-txexpirydelta` option. Is it possible to set it to a value of 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible to set the `-txexpirydelta` option to a value of 2. The minimum allowed value for `-txexpirydelta` is 4, and the default value is 20 (pre-Blossom) or 40 (post-Blossom).\n\n**User:**\nGot it! Another option I'm curious about is `-walletbroadcast`. What is its purpose, and what is its default value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-walletbroadcast` option makes the wallet broadcast transactions, and its default value is actually 1, not 0. This means that transaction broadcasting is enabled by default.\n\n**User:**\nLast question: Is the `-upgradewallet` option required to be set every time the wallet is started?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `-upgradewallet` option is not required to be set every time the wallet is started. It's an optional flag that upgrades the wallet to the latest format on startup, but it's not necessary to specify it every time.",
