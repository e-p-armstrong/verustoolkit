    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to set up a PBaaS chain and I'm having some trouble with the options. What does the `OPTION_NATIVECURRENCY` flag do in a PBaaS chain definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. There is no `OPTION_NATIVECURRENCY` flag in a PBaaS chain definition. The available option flags are `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY`, `OPTION_GATEWAY`, `OPTION_PBAAS`, `OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER`, `OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER`, and `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN`. Can I help you with something else?\n\n**User:**\nI must have gotten it mixed up. I thought I could use the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` flag to set a token as a native currency. Is that correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` flag is actually used to create a single satoshi NFT token that tokenizes control over the root ID. It doesn't have anything to do with native currencies. If you're trying to set a token as a native currency, you'll need to use a different approach.\n\n**User:**\nI've got another question. What is the purpose of the `OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER` flag if it is set on a gateway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER` flag is used when it is **not** set on a gateway. If it is not set, top-level ID and currency registration happen on the launch chain. So, it's actually the opposite of what you might think!",
