    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with my Verus wallet and I'm not sure how to reset it. I was thinking of deleting the testnet directories, would that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI wouldn't recommend that. You shouldn't delete the testnet directories to reset your mainnet Verus wallet. The instructions for deleting directories are specifically for resetting the Verus testnet, not the mainnet. If you want to reset your testnet, you can delete the directories mentioned in the instructions (`~/.komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest` for Linux, etc.) and then restart the testnet daemon or relaunch Verus Desktop. But this won't affect your mainnet wallet.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Thanks for the clarification. I also had a question about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. Can I only use intermediaries to buy and sell VerusIDs on the marketplace?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need to use intermediaries to buy and sell VerusIDs on the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. You can execute transactions in a completely decentralized way, directly peer-to-peer, without any intermediary necessary. The marketplace is designed to be decentralized, so you have full control over your transactions and interactions. Does that make sense?",
