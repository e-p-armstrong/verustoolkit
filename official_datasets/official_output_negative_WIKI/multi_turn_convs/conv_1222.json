    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a VerusID, but I'm not sure if I need permission to do so. How do I get a permission to create a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou don't need permission to create a VerusID. VerusIDs are fully decentralized, which means anyone can create one and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without needing permission to do so. It's all about being in control of your own digital identity!\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I was wondering, are VerusIDs only available on a single blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs can be used to publish ID -> destination address mappings on other blockchains, not just a single blockchain. However, only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit funds in existing UTXOs. So, while you can use VerusIDs on multiple blockchains, the advanced features are exclusive to the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! One more question: Can I change the controlling addresses of a VerusID without updating the spend conditions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, if you change the controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties of a VerusID, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity will follow the updated spend conditions and be subject to the updated keys. So, be careful when making changes to your VerusID, as they can have an impact on how your UTXOs are spent.",

            "VerusIDs are true self-sovereign identities and aren't simply an ID system as much as a fully functional blockchain protocol. There is no business in the protocol, but plenty of opportunity for those who use what it can do for identity applications. Verus ID provides:**Quantum ready** friendly crypto addresses on the worldwide Verus network -- VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.

All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.",
