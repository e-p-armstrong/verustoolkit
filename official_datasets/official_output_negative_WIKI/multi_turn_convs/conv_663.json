    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having some issues with my mainnet Verus wallet. Can you tell me how to reset it by deleting the specified directories?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your mainnet Verus wallet, you'll need to delete the associated directories. **Please note that this will erase all wallet data, including your transaction history and wallet configurations. Make sure to back up your wallet.dat file if you want to keep your wallet's private keys.** \n\nTo reset, delete the following directories: `~/.verus` and `~/.verus/mainnet`. Then, restart your Verus wallet. This should reset your mainnet Verus wallet to its initial state. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about launching a token or liquidity basket AMM. Can I do it off-chain using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus capabilities include on-chain launches of token, centralized currency, and liquidity basket AMMs, not off-chain launches. These on-chain launches allow for more decentralized and transparent transactions. If you're interested in launching a token or AMM, I'd be happy to guide you through the on-chain process using Verus.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. Is it possible to execute transactions with VerusIDs or NFTs using intermediaries?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus ID and NFT marketplace allows for completely decentralized transactions, executing peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. However, it does make room for owners to select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. This way, you have full control over your transactions and can choose to involve third parties if you want to.",
