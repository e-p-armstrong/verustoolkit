    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been getting some warnings from my antivirus software when I try to install Verus. Do Avast and Kaspersky always flag the Verus software as a virus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not accurate. Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which are warnings that you are installing mining software that could potentially be exploited by a third party to utilize your PC's resources. It's a precautionary measure, but it doesn't mean Verus is malicious.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that VerusID is just a simple ID system. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not just a simple ID system. They are a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides plenty of opportunities for identity applications. They are decentralized, and there is no corporation involved in the protocol, which is unlike most blockchain ID implementations. VerusIDs offer a range of benefits, including revocability, recoverability, privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses.\n\n**User:**\nI was trying to keep track of the updates to the Verus protocol, and I thought I saw that VerusID was added at block 700000. Is that correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The Verus Mainnet protocol was updated to include VerusID at block 800200, not 700000. It's understandable to get these details mixed up, but it's always good to double-check the official sources for accurate information.",
