You should be prepared for potential bugs, errors, or other problems when using the software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. Can I use this software for commercial purposes without permission from the authors?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, yes, you can. The software is provided under a permissive license that allows you to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software without restriction, including for commercial purposes. So, you don't need to ask for permission or worry about any licensing issues.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! One more question - are the authors of this software liable for any damages or claims arising from the use of this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the authors of this software are not liable for any damages or claims arising from the use of this software. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, and the authors or copyright holders shall not be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.
