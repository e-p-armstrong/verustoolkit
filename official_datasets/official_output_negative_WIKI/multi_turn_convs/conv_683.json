    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to define a currency and I'm not sure what some of these options do. Can you help me out? Specifically, what does the `OPTION_ID_STAKING` option do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_ID_STAKING` option is often misunderstood, but I'd be happy to clarify. When set, it allows all IDs on the chain to stake equally, rather than value-based staking. It doesn't affect the staking of IDs on a chain based on their value. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! I was also wondering about the `OPTION_TOKEN` option. I thought it was used to define a native currency, but I'm not sure...\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, actually, it's the opposite! The `OPTION_TOKEN` option is used to indicate that this is a token, not a native currency. So, if you're trying to define a native currency, you wouldn't use this option. Does that clear things up?",
