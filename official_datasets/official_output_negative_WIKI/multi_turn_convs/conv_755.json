    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got another question about VerusIDs. Can you explain why an identity's primary authority cannot modify its own revocation authority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the primary authority (which is the self-identity) can modify its own revocation authority, as long as it is not also one of the two other authorities. The primary authority has control over most aspects of the identity, with some exceptions such as the identity's name, its parent (derived from the blockchain), and data under the control of the other authorities. Does that clarify things for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How do you transfer an identity from one party to another without also transferring the associated funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. This means that it is not possible to transfer an identity without also transferring the associated funds. That's an important consideration when managing VerusIDs.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to an identity's funds if its revocation authority revokes it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen an identity is revoked by its revocation authority, access to all funds and transactions under its control is also revoked. However, the revocation authority itself cannot spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity. This helps ensure that the revocation authority doesn't gain unauthorized access to the identity's assets.\n\n**User:**\nCan a recovery authority modify an unrevoked identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a recovery authority cannot modify an unrevoked identity. The recovery authority's powers are limited to redefining or recovering a revoked identity, and it cannot make changes to an identity that has not been revoked. This helps prevent unauthorized changes to an identity that is still active and in use.",
