    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating my own currency on Verus, let's call it \"mycoin\". I was wondering, can anyone mint new coins in the \"mycoin\" currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot quite! No, not anyone can mint new coins in the \"mycoin\" currency. Only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins when `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. This ensures that the creation of new coins is controlled and secured by the designated authority.",
