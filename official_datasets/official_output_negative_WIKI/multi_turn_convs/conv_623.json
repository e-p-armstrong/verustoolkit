    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring VerusIDs and I have a question. Can IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies launch currencies on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies on Verus. Only Native IDs, which are registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, can launch currencies on that blockchain, including actual independent blockchains on Verus. IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies, however, will still be valuable for other uses, such as revocation and recovery IDs, personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses, and more.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering about *.veth gateway IDs. Are they not able to create Ethereum mapped currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter and will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. This is an exception to the rule that non-native IDs cannot create currencies.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification. I've also been playing around with the testnet and I was wondering, if I want to reset my testnet, can I just restart the testnet daemon?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. To reset your testnet, you need to make sure Verus is closed, delete the specified directories, and then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native). Simply restarting the testnet daemon is not enough.",
