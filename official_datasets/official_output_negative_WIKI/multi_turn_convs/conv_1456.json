    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to initiate a currency launch, but I'm not sure why I need to fund my wallet with a certain amount of VRSCTEST. Can you explain why you need to fund your wallet with 1000 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you need to fund your wallet with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch, not 1000 VRSCTEST. Additionally, the currency launch will start at 50 blocks from when the transaction was made (default), and it must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. Do you have any other questions about initiating a currency launch?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the clarification! I have another question. How do you create new tokens after a currency has launched, using a decentralized issuance option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, after a currency has launched, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option, not a decentralized one. I hope that helps clarify things for you! Do you have any other questions about creating new tokens or currency management?\n\n**User:**\nI have one more question. What happens if you send the command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you send the command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, your conversion will be effectively parked until the token launches. At that point, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. Does that make sense? Do you have any other questions about converting VRSCTEST to GOLD or token management?",
