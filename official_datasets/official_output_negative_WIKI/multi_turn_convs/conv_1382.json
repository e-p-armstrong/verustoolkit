    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with the `sendcurrency` API, and I thought I understood how it works, but I'm not sure. Can you explain why the `sendcurrency` API can only be used to send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct! The `sendcurrency` API is more flexible than that. It can be used to send and convert funds in various ways. For example, it can be used to send VRSCTEST from a single address to multiple recipients, or from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients with friendly-name z-addresses. So, you have more options than you thought!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But what happens to testnet coins/currencies when VRSCTEST is reset? Do I need to worry about losing them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. So, in this case, the coins/currencies will be lost. But don't worry, they're just for testing purposes anyway!\n\n**User:**\nOne more question: can you use the `sendcurrency` API to send or convert funds without specifying the amount?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use the `sendcurrency` API to send or convert funds without specifying the amount. The `amount` parameter is required in all examples provided. You'll always need to specify how much you want to send or convert. Does that make sense?",
