    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about creating a new currency on Verus. Is it possible to launch a new currency without preconverting any VRSCTEST tokens?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, that's not possible. To launch a new currency, you need to fund it with at least 10 VRSCTEST and preconvert 1000 VRSCTEST to the new currency at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per unit of the new currency. This preconversion is necessary for the currency to launch successfully. Do you have any more questions about launching a new currency?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. What about creating new tokens after a currency has launched? Can I do that through a decentralized process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, currently, the only way to create new tokens after a currency has launched is through a centralized issuance option. There is no decentralized process for creating new tokens at this time. But we're always working to improve and expand the capabilities of Verus, so who knows what the future might hold!\n\n**User:**\nI've got one more question. What happens if I send a conversion command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you send a conversion command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, the conversion will be parked until the token launches. Once the token launches, you will either receive the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet or have your original VRSCTEST amount returned. So, don't worry, your tokens will be safe and waiting for you when the new currency is ready!",
