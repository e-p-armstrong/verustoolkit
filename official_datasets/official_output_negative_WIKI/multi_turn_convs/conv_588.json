    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been experimenting with chain definitions and I'm not entirely clear on what some of the flags do. Can you help me out? Specifically, what does the `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY` flag do in a PBaaS chain definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY` flag isn't actually specific to PBaaS chain definitions. It's a flag that can be used in PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict them to a single currency. Does that make sense? Do you have any other questions about chain definitions or flags?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I've also been wondering about `OPTION_PBAAS`. Is that a flag that enables gateway functionality in a chain definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. `OPTION_PBAAS` is a flag that indicates that the chain definition is a PBaaS chain, not that it enables gateway functionality. Gateway functionality is actually enabled by the `OPTION_GATEWAY` flag. Does that clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. I've seen `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` mentioned in some chain definitions. Is that a type of token that represents a bundle of multiple assets?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. An `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` is actually a single satoshi NFT token that tokenizes control over the root ID. It's not a bundle of multiple assets. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about chain definitions or tokens.",
