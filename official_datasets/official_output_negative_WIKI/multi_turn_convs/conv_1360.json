    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about the installation process. Is the bootstrap archive required to be kept on my hard drive after completing the installation/update process? I'm trying to free up some space.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the bootstrap archive is not required to be kept on your hard drive after completing the installation/update process. You can remove the downloaded bootstrap archive to free up space on your hard drive if desired. It's only needed during the initial installation or update, and you won't need it again unless you need to reinstall or update Verus in the future.",
