    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into creating currencies on the Verus platform, and I had a few questions. Can I create a currency with any name I want, without needing a corresponding ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not possible. To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But what if I have multiple IDs with the same name? Can I create multiple currencies with the same name, as long as I have multiple IDs with that name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not possible. According to the rules, you can only create one currency of a specific name, and that's tied to the ID of the same name. Once you've created a currency with a certain name, you can't create another one with the same name, even if you have multiple IDs with that name.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. So, just to clarify, can anyone create a currency with any name, without needing to control the corresponding ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not possible. Only the controller of the ID with the same name as the currency can create the currency. They have exclusive control over creating a currency with that name, and no one else can do so.",
