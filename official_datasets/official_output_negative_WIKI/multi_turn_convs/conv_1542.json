    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having trouble with a command in Verus. What is the purpose of the `getidentity` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be a slight mistake. The command is actually `getidentitycontent`, not `getidentity`. The `getidentitycontent` command is used to retrieve the content associated with a specific identity.\n\n**User:**\nI see, thanks for the correction. Can you explain how to use the `getidentitycontent` command with only one parameter, the identity name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getidentitycontent` command actually requires more than one parameter. The correct syntax is `getidentitycontent \"name@ || iid\" (heightstart) (heightend) (txproofs) (txproofheight) (vdxfkey)`. You need to provide the identity name or IID, as well as other parameters such as the height range, transaction proofs, and VDXF key. Unfortunately, you can't use the command with just the identity name. You'll need to provide all the required parameters to get the content associated with the identity.",
