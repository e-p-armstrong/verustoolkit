    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been following the recent operation with the RaceCondition currency, and I was wondering, why did the price and reserves of the RaceCondition currency decrease at the end of the operation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the opposite happened. The price and reserves of the RaceCondition currency increased at the end of the operation due to a bug where fractional currency fees were not being burned into the basket in the case of a straight conversion from fractional to a reserve. This resulted in a buffer, where the person who entered RaceCondition ended up with more than they would have if the math had been properly distributing those fees.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. Was the issue with the RaceCondition currency's fees a minor problem that didn't require a pause of DeFi?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the issue was considered serious enough to require a pause of DeFi. Although it may not seem like a major problem, the calculations involved are part of the consensus mechanism, and any error in them, including fees, is taken very seriously.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. And what about the fix for the fee allocation issue in the RaceCondition scenario? Will it result in the person who exited with 100MM RaceCondition getting 14 VRSC instead of 15?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the fix will actually result in the person who exited with 100MM RaceCondition getting 15 VRSC, not 14. This is because the correct fee allocation will result in a 15 SAT price, which means the person who remains holding the RaceCondition bag would have only some 100s of thousands of SATs left in reserves.",

            "The thing that made me take notice is that there seemed to be more reserves left and a higher price at the end of this operation than I\u2019d expect in the currency, and that turned out to be because only in the case of a straight conversion from fractional to a reserve, not in any other case, the fractional currency fees that should have been burned into the basket were not being captured. Interestingly, in this case it resulted in a form of buffer at the extreme, where the person who entered RaceCondition for 5 VRSC after it was launched and subsequently had 4 of it taken on the exit from one person converting 100,000,000 of the supply ended up with more than they would have, had the math been properly distributing those fees. This was the totality of the issue we found, and though it may not seem that serious to require a pause of DeFi, these calculations are consensus, and we take any error that we find in them, fees or otherwise, quite seriously. This update will operate on the updated rules when the oracle notifications are removed and DeFi is reactivated.The fix means that all fees, including the fractional fees on an exit from a liquidity basket are burned before conversions take place, which in this case, would enable the person who exited with 100MM RaceCondition to take 15 VRSC, instead of the 14 that they did. This is because the correct fee allocation results in a 15 SAT price, which means the person who remains holding the RaceCondition bag would have only some 100s of thousands of SATs left in reserves. On the other hand, anyone could come in and reinflate the 5% currency by converting to it. This event on the network had the effect of reducing the extreme difference between supply and reserves on RaceCondition, and it will operate as a normal 5% reserve currency should when DeFi reactivates.",
