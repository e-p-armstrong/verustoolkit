    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I need some help with Verus. I'm trying to reset my mainnet Verus wallet by deleting the directories mentioned in the instructions. Can you walk me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there's been a misunderstanding. The instructions you're referring to are for resetting a testnet wallet, not a mainnet wallet. To reset a testnet wallet, you need to delete the specified directories and then restart the testnet daemon or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native. However, these instructions do not apply to resetting a mainnet wallet. If you're having issues with your mainnet wallet, I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot or find the correct solution.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. I have another question. Can I use `registernamecommitment` without specifying a currency parent and a funding address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use `registernamecommitment` without specifying a currency parent and a funding address. The command now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. You can use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank if needed, but you still need to provide these arguments. If you're unsure about how to use the command, I'd be happy to help you with the correct syntax and parameters.",
