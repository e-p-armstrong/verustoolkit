    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have some questions about working with Verus IDs and currencies. What is the command to set the `proofprotocol` to PROOF_CURRENCYID in the `definecurrency` command for \"mycoin\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the command doesn't set `proofprotocol` to PROOF_CURRENCYID, but rather to PROOF_CHAINID (which is represented by the value 2). This means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. So, can anyone mint new coins in \"mycoin\" since `proofprotocol` is set to 1?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The `proofprotocol` is not set to 1, but rather to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. This means that only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins, not just anyone.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What is the command to send existing \"mycoin\" coins to an address, rather than minting new ones?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe command `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'` is actually used to mint new coins, not send existing ones. To send existing coins, you would need to use a different command that does not include the `\"mintnew\":1` parameter.",
