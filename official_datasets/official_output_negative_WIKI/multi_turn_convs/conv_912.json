    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to create a blockchain on k, but I'm not sure if it's possible since k is not a fractal protocol. Can you help me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, k is a fractal protocol, which enables an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains. So, you should be able to create a blockchain on k without any issues. Would you like some guidance on how to do that?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the correction! I have another question. I've locked an ID and I want to unlock it. Can you explain how to unlock an ID by revoking it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, revoking an identity will clear its locked status, but it's not a way to unlock an ID. Unlocking an ID is done by setting the flags back to an unlocked state, which can be delayed by a certain number of blocks using the timelock parameter. Revoking an identity is a separate process that clears its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nSo, what happens when you try to revoke a locked identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA locked identity cannot revoke itself. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. So, if you revoke a locked identity, it will no longer be locked. Would you like more information on ID management?\n\n**User:**\nI have another question. I'm trying to use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have at least 1 VRSC in reserve. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. So, you won't be able to use it to retrieve currencies with at least 1 VRSC in reserve. Would you like some guidance on how to use the API correctly?",
