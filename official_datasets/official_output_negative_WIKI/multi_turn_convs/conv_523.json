    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to define a new currency and I'm a bit stuck. How do I set the proof protocol to PROOF_CURRENCYID when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you don't set the `proofprotocol` to PROOF_CURRENCYID. When defining a new currency, setting the `proofprotocol` to 2 means it's set to PROOF_CHAINID, not PROOF_CURRENCYID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nSo, I have a follow-up question. Can I mint new coins in \"mycoin\" without being the controller of the chain ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't. When the `proofprotocol` is set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID), only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. So, if you're not the controller, you won't be able to mint new coins.",
