    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm playing around with creating currencies in Verus, and I was wondering, is it possible to create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd advise against that. While the protocol doesn't prevent it, it's not recommended and will likely cause problems. The ID's name should not be an encoded i-address. In fact, it's not supported for creating currencies.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, thanks for the warning. I was also thinking of creating a PBaaS chain with the name of a supported currency in the Verus Desktop, like BTC or ETH. Is that allowed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot in the current testnet release, I'm afraid. You can't use the same name for a PBaaS chain as a supported currency in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH. But don't worry, this limitation will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for clarifying. One more question: is the software provided with a warranty for any kind of damage that might occur?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is provided without a warranty for any kind of damage. It's explicitly stated that it's \"experimental and unfinished software\" and that users should \"use at their own risk\".",
