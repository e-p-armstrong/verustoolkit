    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've been looking at some currency definitions and I'm not really sure what I'm seeing. Can you help me out? What does it mean when you set `proofprotocol` to 3 in a currency definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help clarify. However, I need to correct you - there is no standard definition for a `proofprotocol` value of 3. It's possible that it's being used in a custom or specific implementation, but in general, it's not a recognized value.\n\nIn some cases, `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which corresponds to PROOF_CHAINID, allowing the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. But again, I want to emphasize that a value of 3 is not a standard or recognized setting. If you can provide more context or information about where you're seeing this, I might be able to help you better.",
