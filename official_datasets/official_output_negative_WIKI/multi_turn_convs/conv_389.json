    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to figure out where VerusTest stores its data on MacOS. Can you tell me what the default directory is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some confusion. There's no such thing as VerusTest, but I'm assuming you meant to ask about VRSCTEST or VerusTest. The default directory for VRSCTEST on MacOS is actually:\n```\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST\n```\nAnd the directory for VerusTest on MacOS is:\n```\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest\n```\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, thanks for clarifying that. Now, I want to launch the mainnet of Verus. What's the command for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's another mistake here. The command you're looking for is actually for launching the testnet of Verus, not the mainnet. The command is:\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST\n```\nUnfortunately, I don't have any information about launching the mainnet of Verus, as it wasn't provided. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
