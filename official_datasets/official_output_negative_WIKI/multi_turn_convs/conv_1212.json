    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with signature validation, and I got a `false` result. What does that mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you get a `false` result in the signature validation process, it means that the signature is not valid. That's as much as we can say about it, unfortunately. The exact meaning of a `false` result isn't specified, but it's safe to assume that the signature didn't pass the validation test.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been hearing about this v0.8.0 update. Is it mandatory for all users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the v0.8.0 update is not mandatory for all users. It's only required if you want to use the testnet, which will be reset as of v0.8.0. If you're not using the testnet, the update is non-mandatory, but still recommended. You can choose to update or not, depending on your needs.",
