    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nBefore I start using Verus, I want to make sure it's safe and reliable. Is this software fully tested and stable, with a guarantee that it won't cause any damage?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI understand your concern for safety and reliability. Unfortunately, I have to inform you that this software is actually experimental and unfinished. It's explicitly stated that there is no warranty for any kind of damage. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranties, express or implied. So, it's essential to use it at your own risk and take necessary precautions.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I understand. That's important to know. Another question I have is, is this software only available for MacOS?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, this software is not only available for MacOS. The links provided suggest that it's also available for Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows. So, you can use it on multiple platforms, depending on your needs.",
