    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about participating in a blockchain launch on Verus, but I have some questions. What happens to the fundraising money if a blockchain launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a blockchain launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met, no fundraising money is received. The funds are refunded to the participants, and the launch doesn't proceed. Do you have any other questions about blockchain launches on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I'm interested in the pre-launch discount. Is the pre-launch discount accompanied by a minimum cap on pre-conversion participation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the pre-launch discount is actually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation, not a minimum cap. This is to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live. The maximum cap helps to maintain a healthy balance and prevents over-participation, ensuring a successful launch. Do you have any more questions about the pre-launch discount or blockchain launches in general?",

            "blockchain launch, which creates new native currency for operating the proof of stake of the blockchain, any currency that uses fundraising options will be a fractionally backed currency which will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it. If a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options that are not met, no fundraising is received:\n - Pre-launch discount - all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency. This is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live.\n- Pre-launch carve-out - this enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.\n- Pre-allocation - this enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods.",
