    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating a new blockchain using Verus, but I'm not sure about the requirements. How do I launch a new blockchain using Verus without creating a bridge converter liquidity pool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, with Verus, you can't launch a new blockchain without creating a bridge converter liquidity pool. When defining a new blockchain, a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool is automatically created as part of the launch process. This is a necessary step in the process, and it allows for the seamless interaction between your new blockchain and the rest of the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was worried that Verus might have some limitations on the number of blockchains that can be created. Is Verus limited to only allowing a few blockchains to be created?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus is not limited in the number of blockchains that can be created. In fact, the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking. This means that you can create as many blockchains as you need, and they will all be able to interact with each other and the rest of the Verus network.",
