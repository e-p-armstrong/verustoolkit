    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm new to Verus and I'm trying to figure out how to create a new identity. Is it possible to make a new identity on Verus without paying any fees?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, it's not possible to create a new identity on Verus without paying any fees. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity, in which case the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. This fee is designed to prevent \"name front running\" by miners.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Another question I had was, can I register a name on Verus without committing to it first?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot register a name on Verus without committing to it first. To prevent \"name front running\", you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name, and then register it. This ensures that your commitment is kept secret until you register and reveal your commitment.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. One more question, is there a way to make a Verus ID in just one step?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, making a Verus ID requires two steps: committing to a name and then registering it. This is designed to prevent \"name front running\" by miners. You cannot make a Verus ID in just one step.",

            "## Making a new identity\nArguably, the hardest part of the new Verus identity technology is just making your first identity, especially without a GUI. Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ \u2018[{\u201caddress\u201d:\u201dalice@\u201d, \u201camount\u201d:100}]\u2019\n```\nor\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100\n```\nMaking a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. To prevent this name \u201cfront running\u201d, you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows:",
