    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about transactions in Verus. What is the default value of the \"minconf\" parameter if it's not specified in the transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default value of the \"minconf\" parameter is actually 1, not 0. This means that by default, the transaction will only use funds that have been confirmed at least once. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that helps. Now, what happens if you set \"returntxtemplate\" to true when sending a transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you set \"returntxtemplate\" to true, the transaction information will be returned without submitting the transaction to the chain. This means that the transaction will not be broadcast to the network or recorded on the blockchain. It's a useful feature for testing or previewing transactions without actually executing them.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question. Can you send a transaction from a decentralized currency ID to create new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, sending a transaction from a currency ID only creates new currency if the currency ID is from a centralized currency. Decentralized currencies do not work in the same way. They have their own mechanisms for creating new coins or tokens, and sending a transaction from a decentralized currency ID won't create new currency.",
