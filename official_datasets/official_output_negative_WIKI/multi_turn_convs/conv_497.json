    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in launching a currency on Verus. I've heard there's a way to do it without any minimum participation requirements. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, that's not the case. Verus currency launches have Kickstarter-like minimums to activate. If these minimums are not met, the funds will automatically be refunded. The dynamic currency launch pricing is based on participation, and there are pre-launch participation price discounts available. This means that there are requirements and rules in place to ensure a successful currency launch. Sorry to disappoint!\n\n**User:**\nThat's okay, I understand. I had another question. Can I launch a currency on Verus that only accepts one specific currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, currencies launched on Verus can be configured to accept a range of other currencies. This flexibility allows for more diverse and dynamic currency ecosystems. So, you can't limit it to just one specific currency.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for clarifying. I've also been playing around with the testnet on Verus, and I was wondering if the coins and currencies I create there are valuable and permanent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, they are not. All testnet coins and currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. So, feel free to experiment and test things out, but don't get too attached to your testnet creations!",

Verus import/export protocol was designed to make integration with other block chains provable and easy, and there are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, where currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network, and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.# Preparing for Multi-chain, Dynamic Merge Mining\nWhile this 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology which was running on testnet last year. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies as well.## Sending and Converting Currency\n**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**",
