    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about the `getinitialcurrencystate` command. What does it do when used with the name of the current chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getinitialcurrencystate \"name\"` command is used to get information about other PBaaS chains that are being launched by the current chain, not about the current chain itself. It returns the total amount of preconversions that have been confirmed on the blockchain for the specified PBaaS chain. So, it's not really meant to be used with the current chain.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I thought that might be the case. So, can I use the `getinitialcurrencystate` command to get the total amount of tokens in circulation on my current chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getinitialcurrencystate` command is not used to get the total amount of tokens in circulation on your current chain. Like I mentioned earlier, it's used to get information about other PBaaS chains that are being launched by your current chain. If you need to get information about your current chain, you would need to use a different command.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. So, does the `getinitialcurrencystate` command only work with the current chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getinitialcurrencystate \"name\"` command is specifically designed to work with other PBaaS chains that are being launched by your current chain, not just the current chain itself. You need to specify the name of the other chain you want to get information about.",
