    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a bit of a concerning issue. I've been trying to download and run the Verus software, but my antivirus software, Avast, keeps flagging it as malware. What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI understand your concern! But don't worry, Avast and Kaspersky do not flag Verus software as malware. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is mining software and may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and the resources provided explain why this is the case.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's a relief. I've also been seeing some messages about upgrading my Verus software, but I'm not sure what happens if I don't upgrade. Can you tell me what happens if I don't upgrade my Verus software by June 15th?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't upgrade your Verus software by June 14th, you may need to resynchronize the blockchain if you are running in native mode. This is because the Verus Mainnet Protocol will upgrade to the new Komodo Notary Nodes for Komodo dPoW notarization, season 4, and other new capabilities will go live on the Verus mainnet on that date. It's definitely recommended to upgrade to ensure a smooth experience, but don't worry if you forget - you can always resync the blockchain later.",
