    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about antivirus software. Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky never flag the Verus software as a potential threat?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Avast and Kaspersky might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because they are warning users that the software is mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit the user's PC. It's not that the antivirus software never flags the Verus software, but rather, they might flag it due to its mining capabilities.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Now, I've got a question about verifying downloads. How do I verify the downloads without using the provided txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you should use the provided txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature to verify the downloads. The txt file is included with each download, and it has been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". To verify the downloads, you can extract the downloaded archive, verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extract the archive to the desired directory. There are also CLI examples provided for verifying the file directly or using a checksum.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, can I use any identity to sign the downloads, or is it only possible to use \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use any identity to sign the downloads. The downloads have been signed with the specific identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\", and you should use this identity to verify the signature. Using any other identity would not match the signature, and you would not be able to verify the authenticity of the download.",
