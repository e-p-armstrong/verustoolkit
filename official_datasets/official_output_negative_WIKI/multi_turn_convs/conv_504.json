    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about verifying downloads. How do I verify a download using a private key?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you don't need a private key to verify a download. Instead, you can use the provided `txt` file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. You can then use the `verus` command-line tool to verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. For example:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AYGcHwABQSCPnizC1yvgpTQCGjoVGNa6DTnFk7Y5cJk4B+UnS8ctLwtxP3HsTvqwR/Hf0TAWFqo3pDc9pBHwfnvVj9ddEDhD /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.3-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.3-x86_64.tar.gz\n```\nThis will verify the signature and ensure that the download is authentic. Do you have any further questions about verifying downloads?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, but I've seen a `verifyhash` command in Verus. What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifyhash` command is actually used to verify a file's integrity by comparing its hash with a known good hash. It's not used to verify a signature, as you might have thought. The `verifyfile` command is used to verify a signature, not `verifyhash`. For example:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AYGcHwABQSCPnizC1yvgpTQCGjoVGNa6DTnFk7Y5cJk4B+UnS8ctLwtxP3HsTvqwR/Hf0TAWFqo3pDc9pBHwfnvVj9ddEDhD d167fe2800bfe3da70009ff3861cf2eb7415fa6fb7c3e132bde10161ac3f49dd\n```\nThis command verifies that the file's hash matches the provided hash.\n\n**User:**\nI've also seen an update to v0.9.2-3. Is that mandatory for all users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the update to v0.9.2-3 is not mandatory for all users. It's \"NON-MANDATORY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET -- CRITICAL FOR TESTNET USE\". This means that it's highly recommended for users on the mainnet, but only critical for users on the testnet.",
