    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a question about syncing my wallet. Will my wallet sync instantly, regardless of the number of addresses I have?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. Your wallet won't sync instantly, regardless of the number of addresses you have. The syncing process may take several minutes to complete, depending on the number of addresses in your wallet and how far along you are on re-syncing. So, be patient and let the syncing process finish before you can be sure of your wallet's status.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Can I trust my wallet balance before it's fully synced?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you shouldn't trust your wallet balance before it's fully synced. Your balance may not reflect an accurate amount until you are fully synced, as the wallet only knows about transactions that have happened in the blocks it has received and scanned. It's always best to wait until the syncing process is complete to get an accurate picture of your wallet's balance.",
