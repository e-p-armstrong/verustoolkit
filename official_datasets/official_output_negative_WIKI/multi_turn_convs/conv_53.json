    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to create a new currency on Verus, and I'm not sure about the process. Can you help me? Specifically, why do you need to fund a currency with a certain amount of VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate a currency launch. Additionally, 1000 VRSCTEST must be preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. This is a requirement to ensure a smooth and secure launch of your new currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, thank you! Another question I had was about creating new tokens after the GOLD token launches. Can you create new tokens without a centralized issuance option after the GOLD token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, after the GOLD token launches, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. So, you'll need to have a centralized authority in place to issue new tokens. This is a design decision to ensure the integrity and security of the token creation process.",
