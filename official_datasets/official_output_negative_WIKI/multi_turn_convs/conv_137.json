    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've downloaded the latest version of Verus, but I want to verify the signature without using the provided txt file. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, it's not possible to verify the signature of a download without using the provided txt file. The txt file is necessary for verification, as it contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. You need to extract the txt file from the downloaded archive and use it to verify the signature of the extracted archive. I hope that helps!\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that there's a new release, v0.9.4-3. Are there any significant changes for mainnet in this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, there aren't any material mainnet changes in this release. The changes in v0.9.4-3 are mainly for testnet and the Ethereum bridge. So, if you're using mainnet, you won't notice any significant differences.",
