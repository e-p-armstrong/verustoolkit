    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been using Verus for a while now, and I'm really impressed with its functionality. But I do have some questions about the software itself. Is this software provided with a warranty that guarantees its functionality and safety?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that you use the software at your own risk, and we can't guarantee that it will work as expected or be free from errors.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I'm also a bit of a developer, and I was wondering if I can modify and distribute this software without including the copyright notice and permission notice?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the permission notice explicitly states that the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. This means that if you modify or distribute the software, you must include the original copyright and permission notices. It's important to respect the intellectual property rights of the original creators of the software.",
