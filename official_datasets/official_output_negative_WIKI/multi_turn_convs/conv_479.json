    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how VerusIDs work. How do you register an identity on the Verus network without providing any information about the identity, such as its name or primary addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, it's not possible to register an identity on the Verus network without providing information about the identity. To register an identity, you need to provide a JSON object that includes details such as the identity's name, primary addresses, and minimum signatures required.\n\n**User:**\nSo, I've heard that Verus is a decentralized network. Does that mean anyone can register an identity on the Verus network without needing permission from anyone?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot always. While Verus is a decentralized network, there are some cases where permission is required to register a new identity. If a currency's ID issuance requires permission from the currency's identity, then the identity owner must sign the name commitment and identity registration. So, in some cases, permission is needed from the currency's identity to register a new identity.",
