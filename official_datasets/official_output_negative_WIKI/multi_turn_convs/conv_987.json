    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few questions about Verus blockchain launches. I've heard that they always require a central authority to manage the launch process. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not accurate. Verus blockchain launches do not require a central authority to manage the launch process. In fact, they offer a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. This means that the launch process can be managed in a decentralized manner, without relying on a central authority.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also heard that if the minimum participation levels are not met, participants will always lose their pre-conversion funds. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. If the minimum participation levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. This means that participants will not lose their funds, but rather receive a refund if the minimum participation levels are not met.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been wondering, how does the Verus network limit the number of interoperable blockchains that can be created?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus network does not limit the number of interoperable blockchains that can be created. In fact, it allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. This is made possible by the use of Notary IDs, which provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking. Does that clarify things for you?",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.
