    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about Verus Vault and I'm curious about how it works. Does Verus Vault provide a way to immediately access funds in a locked VerusID without any delay?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no. Verus Vault provides a solution that allows for a delay between unlocking a locked VerusID and accessing the funds. This delay can be set to a specific time period, such as 24 hours, which provides an additional layer of security against unauthorized access. With a locked VerusID, even someone with the primary keys (including a multisig of primary keys) must first unlock the ID and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access the funds.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But what about if someone has the primary keys of a locked VerusID? Can they just access the funds without any restrictions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Even someone with the primary keys of a locked VerusID must first unlock the ID and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access the funds. This provides an additional layer of security and allows for the revocation and recovery authority identities to intervene in case of unauthorized access.\n\n**User:**\nI see. And I was wondering, does Verus Vault only provide protection for funds and not for IDs and NFTs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault provides protection not only for funds but also for IDs and NFTs. It offers a comprehensive solution for securing and recovering various blockchain assets, including funds, IDs, and NFTs, as well as providing additional features such as time locks for purposes like vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.",

            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock.

This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs.
