    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi! I have some questions about creating currencies on Verus. Can anyone create a currency with a specific name, like \"gold@\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not anyone can create a currency with a specific name. The controller of the ID with the same name as the currency is the only one who can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once. For example, to create a currency called \"gold@\", you would need to have control of the ID \"gold@\". Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! Is it possible to launch multiple currencies with the same name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it is not possible to launch multiple currencies with the same name. The controller of an ID can only create a currency with that name once. So, if someone has already created a currency called \"gold@\", no one else can create another one with the same name.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. Can you launch a currency without funding the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot launch a currency without funding the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command to initiate a currency launch.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Finally, is it possible to create new tokens without a centralized issuance option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrently, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. However, it's worth noting that this may change in the future, and decentralized options might become available. But for now, centralized issuance is the only way to go.",
