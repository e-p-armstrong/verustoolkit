    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a question about sending native currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain. When I do that, is it automatically converted to reserve currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not automatically converted. When sending native currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain, you need to specify the `toreserve` option in the command to convert it to reserve currency. For example, you would use a command like this: `./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{\"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"toreserve\": 1}'`. If you don't specify `toreserve`, it will remain in the native currency.",
