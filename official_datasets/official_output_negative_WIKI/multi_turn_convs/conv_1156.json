    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a Lite wallet address and I want to import it into my native Verus Desktop, but I don't have a running native wallet. Is there a way to do this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't import your Lite wallet address into your native Verus Desktop without a running native wallet. You need to have a running native wallet first, which is fully synchronized, to convert your seedphrase into a Private key (WIF). The earliest wallet that supports these functions is Verus Desktop v0.6.4-beta-1. If you don't have a running native wallet, you can follow the instructions to quickly synchronize your wallet.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So I just need to use any version of Verus Desktop to convert my seedphrase into a Private key (WIF), right?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. You cannot use any version of Verus Desktop to convert your seedphrase into a Private key (WIF). The earliest wallet that supports these functions is **Verus Desktop v0.6.4-beta-1**. You need to use at least this version or later to convert your seedphrase. Make sure you're using the correct version to avoid any issues.",
