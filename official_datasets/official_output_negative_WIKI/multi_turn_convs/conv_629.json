    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about VerusIDs and I have a question. Why do Verus identities not require permission from the currency's identity for ID issuance?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception. Verus identities do require permission from the currency's identity for ID issuance. If a currency's ID issuance requires permission from the currency's identity, then it must sign the name commitment and identity registration. This ensures that the currency's identity has control over who can create identities on their currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, thanks for the clarification. I've also heard that Verus identities aren't self-sovereign or provable. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not accurate. Verus identities are, in fact, self-sovereign and provable. Verus provides on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles. This means that users have full control over their identities and can prove their ownership and authenticity without relying on a central authority. Verus IDs are designed to be decentralized, secure, and transparent, giving users the power to manage their digital identities with confidence.",
