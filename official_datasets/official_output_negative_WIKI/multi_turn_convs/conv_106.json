    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to figure out how to use Verus Vault to create a time-locked wallet that can be unlocked by anyone, without any restrictions. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI see what you're trying to do. Unfortunately, Verus Vault's time-locking feature is not designed to allow anyone to unlock a wallet without restrictions. Instead, it can be used to create time-locked funds that can be unlocked by the owner or designated parties after a certain period of time. The `timelock` parameter defines the unlock height of the identity or the number of blocks to delay an ID's unlock. Additionally, a locked identity cannot revoke itself, and revoking an identity will clear its locked status.\n\n**User:**\nThat's not what I was hoping to hear. Moving on, I was wondering if I can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have any amount of VRSC in reserve?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getcurrencyconverters` API only retrieves currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve and a VRSC reserve ratio of at least 10%. It does not return all currencies with any amount of VRSC in reserve.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question. Are testnet coins and currencies the same as mainnet coins and currencies, and do they have real value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, testnet coins and currencies have no value and will disappear whenever the VRSCTEST network is reset. They are only for testing purposes and are not equivalent to mainnet coins and currencies. They don't have any real value, so don't worry about losing them!",

            "In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g.
