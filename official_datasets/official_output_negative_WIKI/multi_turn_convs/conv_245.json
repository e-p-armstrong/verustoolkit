    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a new raw transaction using the `sendrawtransaction` command, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you help me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's a misunderstanding! The `sendrawtransaction` command doesn't actually create a new raw transaction. Instead, it submits a raw transaction (serialized and hex-encoded) to the local node and network. To create a new raw transaction, you would use the `createrawtransaction` command.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see! Thanks for the clarification. I was also wondering about the `allowhighfees` argument in the `sendrawtransaction` command. What's the default value for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default value of the `allowhighfees` argument is actually `false`, not `true`. This means that by default, high fees are not allowed. Just something to keep in mind when working with the `sendrawtransaction` command!",
