    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `z_getbalance` command, but I'm not sure how it works. Can I use it to send Verus coins to a specific address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's a misunderstanding. You don't use the `z_getbalance` command to send Verus coins to a specific address. The `z_getbalance` command is actually used to get the total amount of Verus coins received for a specific address. It returns the total amount in KMD received for the specified address. If you want to send Verus coins, you would need to use a different command. Would you like to know more about how to send coins?\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see! I thought I could use it to send coins. Thanks for clearing that up. But I have another question. Can I use the `z_getnewaddress` command to get the balance of a specific address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use the `z_getnewaddress` command to get the balance of a specific address. The `z_getnewaddress` command is actually used to generate a new shielded address for receiving payments. It returns a new shielded address, not the balance of an existing address. If you want to get the balance of an address, you would need to use the `z_getbalance` command. Does that make sense?",
