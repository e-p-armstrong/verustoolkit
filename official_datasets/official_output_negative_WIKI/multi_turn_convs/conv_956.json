    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `sendreserve` command to send VRSCTEST to a wallet on another chain. Can I use this command to send the VRSCTEST directly to the wallet without converting it to the native currency of that chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use the `sendreserve` command to send VRSCTEST directly to a wallet on another chain without converting it to the native currency of that chain. The `sendreserve` command is used to send reserve currency to an address on another chain, and it will arrive as reserve currency.\n\n**User:**\nSo how can I send VRSCTEST to an address on another chain and convert it to the native currency of that chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo do that, you need to use the `tonative` option with the `sendreserve` command. For example, you can use a command like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```\nThis will send the VRSCTEST and convert it to the native currency of the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain at the current market price. Does that make sense?",
