    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been having some issues with the Verus software. Most antivirus software flags it as a virus. What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question! The Verus software is not flagged as a virus by most antivirus software. Avast and Kaspersky may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that you are installing mining software, not a virus. These warnings are due to the software being related to mining, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. It's nothing to worry about - Verus is perfectly safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. What's the current status of the mainnet release of Verus? Is it available for use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe mainnet release of Verus is not yet available for use. The current release is intended for use in the VRSCTEST network, and mainnet use is still being tested. We're working hard to get it ready, but it's not quite there yet.\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about Verus ID. Can you explain how it works, and what advantages it has over traditional blockchain systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus ID provides an elegant solution to fundamental problems in blockchain systems. It provides quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities. The advantages of Verus ID include: 1) Identity and currency address are one and the same, allowing your friendly name to be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer. This makes it a powerful and unique solution compared to traditional blockchain systems. Do you have any more questions about Verus ID or Verus in general?",
