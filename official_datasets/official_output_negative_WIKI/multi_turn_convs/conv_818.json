    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm planning to upgrade my Verus testnet, but I'm worried about losing some of my files. How do I safely upgrade my Verus testnet without deleting any files?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, to ensure a clean start with the new testnet, I recommend deleting some directories before running the update. You should delete the following directories: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest` on Linux, `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST` and `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest` on Mac OS, and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\VerusTest` on Windows. This will ensure a fresh start with the new testnet.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the tip! I'm also wondering, is the Verus testnet software fully production-ready and supported by a commercial entity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not. The Verus testnet software is **experimental and unfinished**. It's released under a permissive free software license, and there is no warranty or liability for any kind of damage. You use it at your own risk! Keep in mind that it's still in the testing phase and not yet ready for production use.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the warning. One more question: can I redistribute the Verus testnet software with my own proprietary license terms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot redistribute the Verus testnet software with your own proprietary license terms. The software is released under a permissive free software license, which allows free use, modification, and redistribution, but requires that any copies or substantial portions of the software include the original copyright notice and permission notice. You'll need to respect the original license terms if you choose to redistribute the software.",
