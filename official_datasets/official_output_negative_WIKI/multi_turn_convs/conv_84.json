    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm from an exchange that uses the Verus network. I heard about the v0.7.3-3 update. Is it optional for us?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the v0.7.3-3 update is considered CRITICAL and mandatory for exchanges, pools, and businesses using the Verus network. It fixes potential, targeted DOS attacks that do not affect overall network security. It's important that you update as soon as possible to ensure the security and integrity of your operations.\n\n**User:**\nDoes the update include fixes for issues on the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the v0.7.3-3 update is a mainnet-focused release and does not fix any issues on the testnet. Testnet issues will be addressed in upcoming optional releases. So, you can expect separate updates to address any testnet issues in the future.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about the new Verus testnet. Is it a centralized blockchain platform?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform. It allows for unlimited identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains, and is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets. So, you can rest assured that the testnet maintains the decentralized nature of the Verus network.",
