    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in helping the Verus Coin Foundation improve the protocol, and I heard they're offering a bounty for reporting bugs. Is that true? Are they offering a bounty of 1,000 VRSC for reporting any bug in the protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm glad you're interested in contributing! However, to clarify, the bounty of 1,000 VRSC is specifically for the first person to find and describe an exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol. The bounty for reporting any actual protocol bug is at least 500 VRSC. So, while there's still a reward for reporting bugs, it's not 1,000 VRSC for every bug.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know. I've been testing the protocol and I've found a few bugs already. Do I need to reset my testnet every time I find a bug?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need to reset your testnet every time you find a bug. The testnet reset instructions are provided in case you need to reset your testnet, but this is not necessary for reporting bugs. You can simply report the bug and continue testing the protocol. Just make sure to provide detailed information about the bug you found, so the developers can reproduce and fix it.",

            "The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for the imminent mainnet release of the PBaaS upgrade and start building your vision today!\n## Verus PBaaS and DeFi RC5 - BUG BOUNTIES\nAt this time, we are not aware of any bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross chain protocols on this version of testnet. We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all of the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release. While we don\u2019t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people (7 still unclaimed) who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended. If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):- Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`",
