    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to launch a new currency, but I'm not sure about the requirements. How do I initiate a currency launch without funding the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to initiate a currency launch without funding the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. According to the protocol, a currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the command to initiate a currency launch. This is a required step to ensure the currency has the necessary backing.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Thanks for the clarification. After a currency launches, can I create new tokens using a decentralized issuance option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, according to the protocol, after a currency launches, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. There is no decentralized issuance option available for creating new tokens after a currency launch.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also trying to convert some VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches. If I send the command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, will I receive 1 GOLD for every 1 VRSCTEST I convert?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. According to the protocol, if you send the command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. The conversion rate is 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD, not 1:1. Make sure to understand the conversion rate to avoid any surprises!",
