    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few more questions about VerusIDs. How do Verus IDs restrict digital signatures to only a limited set of trusted journalists and developers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus IDs don't restrict digital signatures to only a limited set of trusted journalists and developers. In fact, digital signatures using Verus ID are available to anyone, allowing any journalist, developer, or individual to sign and establish the authenticity of their content, binaries, or files. This means you can use VerusID to prove the authenticity of your work or files, no matter who you are.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What about control? Are Verus IDs controlled by a central corporation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus IDs are not controlled by a central corporation. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, Verus IDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol with no corporation involved in the protocol. This means that VerusIDs are decentralized and community-driven, giving you full control over your digital identity.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great. One last question: Do Verus IDs only provide limited opportunities for identity applications?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus IDs provide plenty of opportunities for identity applications. Verus ID is a fully functional blockchain protocol that enables a wide range of identity applications, including digital signatures, authentication, and more. The possibilities are endless, and it's up to you to explore and create the applications that suit your needs.",

            "For example, using Verus ID signatures, it\u2019s possible for any journalist anywhere to sign photos, videos, and content, establish a reputation for authenticity, and counter the potential for deep-fakes to make the truth harder to find. Open source projects can now create their own identities and digitally sign their binary releases, ensuring that not only can a file be verified by hash as the one downloaded from a particular server, but by signature as the actual file initially signed by the developer or release engineer. Signatures also form the basis for any attestation of one party to the validity of another. In fact, there are so many applications for digital signatures, from things listed already, to physical entry systems, to workflow applications, to new earning opportunities that a full discussion of use cases would overwhelm these release notes.In any case, we are happy to release digital signatures for all, and we hope you enjoy using this new, simple capability, maybe even think of a new use case you\u2019d like to pursue yourself as a business opportunity on the Verus Network!# Verus ID\nVerus IDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system.
