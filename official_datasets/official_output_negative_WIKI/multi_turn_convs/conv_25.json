    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to launch a new currency on Verus, and I'm not sure about the process. How do I initiate a currency launch immediately after sending the transaction returned from the command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't initiate a currency launch immediately after sending the transaction. The launch will start at 50 blocks from when the transaction was made (default). This is a built-in mechanism to ensure the integrity of the launch process. You'll just need to wait for the 50-block mark for your currency launch to take effect.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I also have another question about token creation. Can I create new tokens without a centralized issuance option after the GOLD token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrently, the only way to create new tokens after the GOLD token launches is with a centralized issuance option. This is a limitation of the current system, but the Verus team is always working on improving and expanding the capabilities of the platform.",
