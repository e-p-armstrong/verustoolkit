    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about flags in Verus. What does the OPTION_NATIVECURRENCY flag do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. There is no OPTION_NATIVECURRENCY flag. The available OPTION flags include OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY, OPTION_GATEWAY, OPTION_PBAAS, and others, but not OPTION_NATIVECURRENCY. Maybe you're thinking of something else?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I was thinking about the OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY flag. Can you explain how it's used to enable multiple currencies on a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been a misunderstanding. The OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY flag is actually used to restrict a PBaaS chain or gateway to a single currency, not to enable multiple currencies. This flag is used to limit the chain or gateway to only one currency, rather than allowing multiple currencies. It's the opposite of what you thought!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What about the OPTION_NFT_TOKEN flag? I was told it's not related to tokenizing control over the root ID. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. The OPTION_NFT_TOKEN flag is actually used to create a single satoshi NFT token, which tokenizes control over the root ID. This flag is used to create a special type of token that represents control over the root ID, and it's not used for any other purpose.",
