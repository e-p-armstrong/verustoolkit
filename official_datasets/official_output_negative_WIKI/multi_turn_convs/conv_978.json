    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I was wondering about the reliability of the software. Is it fully tested and guaranteed to be free of bugs and issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. The software is explicitly labeled as \"experimental and unfinished\" and comes with a disclaimer that it is \"use at your own risk\" with \"no warranty for any kind of damage\". This means that the software may still have bugs or issues and is not guaranteed to be free of problems. It's important to keep this in mind when using the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I did notice that my antivirus software flagged the software as a potential threat. Are antivirus software warnings about this software always accurate and indicative of a real threat?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, they're not. Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", which are warnings that the software is mining software and may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, these warnings are false positives and the software is not actually a virus or malware. You can safely ignore these warnings.\n\n**User:**\nI also had a question about the software's source code. Is it proprietary and only available to a select few?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not. The software's license explicitly grants permission to \"any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files\" to \"deal in the Software without restriction\", including the right to \"use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software\". This means that the software's source code is open and available for anyone to access and modify. You can review the code yourself and even contribute to its development if you're interested.",
