    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring the options for tokens and chains on Verus, and I had a few questions. What does the `OPTION_PBAAS` flag do when set on a token?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `OPTION_PBAAS` flag is not for tokens, but for PBaaS chain definitions. When set, it indicates that this is a PBaaS chain definition. It's not meant to be used on tokens.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was also wondering, is there an `OPTION_NATIVE_CURRENCY` flag to define a native currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, there is no `OPTION_NATIVE_CURRENCY` flag. Verus doesn't use a specific flag for defining native currencies.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And finally, what is the purpose of the `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY` flag when set on a gateway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY` flag isn't specifically for gateways, although it can be used on them. Its purpose is to restrict a PBaaS chain or gateway to a single currency. It's not exclusive to gateways, but rather a more general option for certain types of chains or gateways.",
