    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few questions about the Verus software. I was wondering, does it come with a warranty that guarantees it will work as expected?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that there is no guarantee that the software will work as expected or meet any specific standards. You should use it at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, if I encounter any issues with the software, the authors or copyright holders will be liable for any damages or other liability, right?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The authors or copyright holders will not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. The software is provided without warranty or liability. You should be aware of this before using it.\n\n**User:**\nI've been getting some warnings from my antivirus software, Avast and Kaspersky. They're saying that the software is malware and will harm my computer. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), but this is a false positive. These warnings are triggered because the software is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, the software itself is not malware and will not harm your computer. You can safely ignore these warnings.",
