    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about the software. Who is responsible if I encounter issues with the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the terms, you should not contact the authors or copyright holders for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. They are not liable for any issues that may arise. You should carefully review the terms and conditions before using the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also got a question about security. Are the software binaries on VirusTotal completely virus-free?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software binaries on VirusTotal may not be completely virus-free. Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which means they may detect it as mining software that could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, this does not necessarily mean the software is malicious. It's always important to exercise caution when downloading and installing software, and make sure you're getting it from a trusted source.",
