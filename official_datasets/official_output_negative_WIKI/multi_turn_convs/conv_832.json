    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've heard that I need to update my Verus software by December 15th. Can you tell me why that is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, that's correct. You need to update your Verus software by December 15th because at block 800200, the Verus mainnet protocol will hardfork, and this update is mandatory to remain on the Verus mainnet. If you don't update, you may need to resynchronize the blockchain if you are running in native mode. Make sure to update before the deadline to avoid any issues.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard some rumors about Avast and Kaspersky flagging Verus software. Is it true that they will never flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", which are warnings that you are installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. It's always a good idea to be cautious when installing any software and make sure you're getting it from a trusted source.\n\n**User:**\nI've been learning more about VerusIDs, and I was wondering if they're just a simple ID system with no additional features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not just a simple ID system. They are a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides plenty of opportunities for identity applications, including revocability, recoverability, privacy, and more. They offer a lot of benefits and features that go beyond a traditional ID system. Do you have any other questions about VerusIDs or Verus in general?",
