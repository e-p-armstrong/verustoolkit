    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some issues with Verus. I was trying to install it, but my antivirus software, Avast, flagged it as a virus. Is Verus actually a virus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus is not a virus. Avast and Kaspersky antivirus software may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program), which is a warning that you are installing mining software that could potentially be used to exploit your PC if installed by a third party. This is not a detection of a virus. It's just a warning to let you know that the software has the potential to be used for malicious purposes if not installed and used correctly.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been hearing about a recent update to the Verus mainnet protocol. Can you tell me a bit more about that? What was the main reason for the update at block 800200?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main reason for the Verus mainnet protocol update at block 800200 was not just to fix the accretion of coinbases in mempool, but also to include VerusID, a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides opportunities for identity applications. This update was a significant milestone for the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nSpeaking of VerusIDs, I've been wondering about them. Are they a centralized ID system controlled by a corporation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not a centralized ID system controlled by a corporation. They are a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides opportunities for identity applications, and there is no corporation involved in the protocol. VerusIDs are decentralized and give users full control over their digital identity, data, and assets.",
