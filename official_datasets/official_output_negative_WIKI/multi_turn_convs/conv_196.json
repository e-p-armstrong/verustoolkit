    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to define a new currency and I'm not sure about the `proofprotocol` setting. What's the effect of setting `proofprotocol` to 3?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. Setting `proofprotocol` to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID, allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins, not anyone. This can be done with a command like `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'`.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the correction. Another question, do I need to specify an `initialsupply` value when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you do! When defining a new currency, you need to specify an `initialsupply` value, which sets the initial supply of the new currency. In the example, the `initialsupply` is set to 20000. Make sure to include this value when creating your new currency.",
