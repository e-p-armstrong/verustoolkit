    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with Verus Vault and I was wondering, is there a way to use it to instantly unlock funds without any delay or time-locking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus Vault is designed to provide time-locking capabilities, and it doesn't have a feature to instantly unlock funds without any delay or time-locking. The timelock parameter is used to define the unlock height of the identity, and the time delay parameter is used to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. If you want to provide time-locked funds, you would need to set the timelock parameter to a specific block height or delay.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. That makes sense. Another question I had was about testnet coins and currencies. Are they permanent and will they not disappear?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, testnet coins and currencies are not permanent and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. According to the warning, \"All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset.\" So, keep in mind that anything you do on the testnet is only for testing and won't have any lasting value. Do you have any other questions about Verus or Verus Vault?",
