    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a question about the `getcurrencyconverters` RPC API. How do I use it to query only a specific subset of nodes on the blockchain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getcurrencyconverters` RPC API doesn't allow you to query a specific subset of nodes. Instead, it enables instant queries of **any** full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This means that it queries the entire blockchain network, not just a specific subset of nodes. This allows wallets or applications to easily find the best conversion rates worldwide.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I also have a question about the Verus Vault technology. Does it prevent staking on locked funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus Vault technology does not prevent staking on locked funds. In fact, it enables easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, and protocols for theft-proofing funds, while still allowing staking on locked funds. This means that users can enjoy the benefits of staking while still maintaining control over their funds and identity.",

            "- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.",
