    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a few questions about using VerusIDs. How do I send money to a blockchain address using a friendly name without creating an identity first?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to send money to a friendly name without creating an identity first. Creating an identity is a prerequisite to using friendly names instead of base58 blockchain addresses or hashes. Once you have your own identity, you can use friendly names in CLI commands, such as `z_sendmany` or `sendtoaddress`. Would you like to know more about creating an identity?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Is it possible to register a name commitment without paying any VRSC or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible to register a name commitment without paying any VRSC or VRSCTEST. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity, in which case the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. Do you have any other questions about registering a name commitment?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Can I register an identity with a friendly name that is already taken by someone else?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot register an identity with a friendly name that is already taken by someone else. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you want, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization. Would you like to know more about friendly names or identities?",

            "## Making a new identity\nArguably, the hardest part of the new Verus identity technology is just making your first identity, especially without a GUI. Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ \u2018[{\u201caddress\u201d:\u201dalice@\u201d, \u201camount\u201d:100}]\u2019\n```\nor\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100\n```\nMaking a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. To prevent this name \u201cfront running\u201d, you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows:",
