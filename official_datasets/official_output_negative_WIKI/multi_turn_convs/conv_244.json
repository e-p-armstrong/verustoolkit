    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into Verus Fee Pooling and I'm a bit concerned. I've heard that it compromises blockchain security by creating a risk of weakening it. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a common misconception! Verus Fee Pooling technology, in fact, strengthens blockchain security rather than weakening it. It does this by preserving the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time. This model addresses legitimate concerns about fee distribution and blockchain security, as expressed by Vitalik Buterin.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! I'm still curious about how it works, though. What's the maximum percentage of the aggregate fee pool that a block miner or staker can take in the Verus Fee Pooling model?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus Fee Pooling model, the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool, not more. This ensures a fair distribution of fees while maintaining the security and integrity of the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been looking into Verus Vault. From what I understand, it's just a capability that provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, right?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot quite! Verus Vault is not limited to just providing options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management. It enables many use cases beyond that, such as trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, estate planning, and more. It builds upon the unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet, and its implications are immense.",

In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more.
