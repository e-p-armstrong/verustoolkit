    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have some questions about the recent Verus upgrade. I heard that the Verus v0.7.2-2 upgrade is mandatory for all Verus nodes and wallets. Can you confirm that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not entirely accurate. The Verus v0.7.2-2 upgrade is only mandatory for pools and notaries, not for all Verus nodes and wallets. While there are some improvements and fixes in this release, it is not a generally mandatory upgrade for all users.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I also heard that the Verus testnet was not relaunched and is still using the old network protocol. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. The Verus testnet was deleted and relaunched on v0.7.2-2, with a new network protocol that includes fully decentralized finance, advanced ID capabilities, and a DeFi liquidity system.\n\n**User:**\nI thought I understood how the Verus testnet worked, but now I'm not so sure. Can you explain how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network, not centralized. It has 50% proof of work and 50% proof of stake, and is available worldwide. It's running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. I heard that the currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have real value and can be used to make purchases. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet.",
