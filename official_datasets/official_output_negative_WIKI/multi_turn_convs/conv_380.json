    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand the Verus Coin Foundation's release process. Can you help me with something? Why does the Verus Coin Foundation Releases@ identity not sign the downloaded archives?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Actually, the Verus Coin Foundation Releases@ identity does sign the downloaded archives. A txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, is included for each download. This allows users to verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. Does that clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But what happens if the signature is invalid when verifying a download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the signature is invalid, the result will not be \"true\". You should not trust the download if the signature doesn't verify correctly. It's an important security check to ensure the integrity of the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been wondering about the v0.9.1-1 upgrade. Is it only recommended for notaries, pools, and exchanges?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the v0.9.1-1 upgrade is not only recommended for notaries, pools, and exchanges. While it is critical for them, it is also highly recommended for all mainnet users and mandatory for testnet users. It's important that everyone upgrades to ensure the stability and security of the network.",
