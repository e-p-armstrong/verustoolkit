    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about the initial price in reserve at chain launch. I've heard it starts at 0.1, is that correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. The initial price in reserve at chain launch starts at 1.0, not 0.1. There will be some fees to be paid in the early blocks that will come in as reserve currency, but the starting point is 1.0. Do you have any other questions about the chain launch or reserve currency?\n\n**User:**\nThat clears things up, thanks! I've also been wondering, what happens if I don't specify a refund address when converting from reserve before the chain has started?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't specify a refund address when converting from reserve before the chain has started, it will default to the payment address. So, for example, if you use a command like `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"preconvert\": 1}'`, the refund address would be the same as the payment address, which is `R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM`. Does that make sense?",

All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve.
