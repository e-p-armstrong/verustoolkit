    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get the most out of my VerusIDs and I have a few questions about advanced features. How do I enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities without setting up a primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to help! Unfortunately, you cannot enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities without setting up a primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID. It is a requirement to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured to enable these features. Having these IDs set up is essential for the security and flexibility that VerusIDs provide.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've got another question. Can I spend or access funds immediately after unlocking my VerusID, even if I have a multisig of primary keys?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot spend or access funds immediately after unlocking your VerusID, even if you have a multisig of primary keys. You must first unlock and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before you can spend or access funds. This is a security feature that allows for decentralized recovery of your funds in case of unauthorized access. It's an extra layer of protection to ensure that your assets are safe.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. One more question: Is Verus Vault only limited to protecting funds and not other digital assets like IDs and NFTs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault is not limited to protecting funds only. It also provides the same level of security for your IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. So, you can rest assured that all your digital assets are protected with the same level of security and flexibility that VerusIDs offer.",
