    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI was just looking through the documentation for Verus, and I saw something that caught my attention. Why does this software come with a 5-year warranty and a 30-day money-back guarantee?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion here. This software does not come with a warranty or a money-back guarantee. The software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, and the authors and copyright holders are not liable for any damages or issues that may arise from its use. It's essential to understand that Verus is still an experimental and unfinished project, and users should be aware of the risks involved.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. I was mistaken. In that case, how do I get support for this software if I encounter any issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, since the software is experimental and unfinished, there is no official support available. Users are responsible for using it at their own discretion and risk. However, you can try reaching out to the community or online forums dedicated to Verus, where you might find helpful resources or knowledgeable individuals who can assist you with your issues. Keep in mind that any support you receive will be on a best-effort basis, and there are no guarantees of resolution.",
