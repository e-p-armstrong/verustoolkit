    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit confused. I thought VerusIDs were not suitable for self-sovereign identities and funds addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception. VerusIDs are specifically designed for creating friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. They provide a decentralized solution for managing identities and funds, giving users complete control over their own IDs and assets. VerusIDs are perfect for self-sovereign identities and funds addresses.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I understand that now. But how does Verus Vault enable funds to be spent while an identity is locked? I thought that would be a security risk.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault does not enable funds to be spent while an identity is locked. In fact, it does the opposite: it allows identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked. This provides an additional layer of security and theft prevention. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. Are VerusIDs only compatible with Verus PBaaS blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not limited to Verus PBaaS blockchains. The VerusID protocol is a protocol that can also be implemented on non-Verus systems, making it a versatile and widely applicable solution for identity management and funds addresses.",
