    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit hesitant to install the Verus software, as my antivirus software (Avast and Kaspersky) flags it as a virus. Should I be concerned?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI completely understand your concern! However, you don't need to be concerned about installing Verus software because of false positives from Avast and Kaspersky. These warnings are due to the software being flagged as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which means that it may be used for mining and could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, Verus is a legitimate software and these warnings are just false positives. You can rest assured that Verus is a safe and legitimate software.\n\n**User:**\nI'm still a bit uneasy about installing it. How do I verify the download of Verus software to ensure it's legitimate?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI completely understand your caution! To verify the download of Verus software, you can follow these steps: 1) Extract the downloaded archive, 2) Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and 3) Extract the archive to the desired directory. You can also use the CLI examples provided to verify the file directly or using a checksum. This will ensure that the software you're installing is legitimate and safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that there's a new version of Verus available, v0.9.0-1. Is it mandatory to upgrade to this version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not mandatory to upgrade to Verus v0.9.0-1, but it's highly recommended for mainnet users, Komodo notaries, and mandatory for testnet users to ensure a reliable connection to the current testnet. However, full nodes must be upgraded to v0.9.0 or later by block 1796400, which is expected to occur on or around Monday, November 29th at 6:15PM UTC, to remain connected to the mainnet Verus blockchain. It's always a good idea to stay up-to-date with the latest version to ensure you have the latest features and security patches.",
