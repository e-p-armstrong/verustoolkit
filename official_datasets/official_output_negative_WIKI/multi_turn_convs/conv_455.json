    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few more questions about the Verus ecosystem. How do the fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool get distributed back to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! Fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are not distributed back to the Verus blockchain. Instead, they are earned on the new blockchain, providing seamless connectivity with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's clear, thanks! Another question: can you explain why a minimum level of worldwide participation is not required for a blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some misunderstanding. A minimum level of worldwide participation is required for a blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launch. If the minimum level of participation is not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, minus network fees. So, it's actually the opposite - a minimum level of participation is necessary for a successful launch.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the correction! One more question: is it possible to create only a limited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible to create only a limited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, with no limit on the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. So, the possibilities are endless!",
