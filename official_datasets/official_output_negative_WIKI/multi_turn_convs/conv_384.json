    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a question about filtering. Can I set the maximum confirmations to filter to 0 using the `maxconf` argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't set the maximum confirmations to filter to 0 using the `maxconf` argument. The default value of `maxconf` is 9999999, and you can set it to a higher value or a lower value, but not 0. The minimum value for `maxconf` is 1. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question about filtering. Can I filter on a single address by passing a string instead of a JSON array of addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't filter on a single address by passing a string instead of a JSON array of addresses. The `addresses` argument requires a JSON array of zaddrs, even if you only want to filter on one address. You would need to pass a JSON array with a single element, like `[\"address\"]`. Does that make sense?",
