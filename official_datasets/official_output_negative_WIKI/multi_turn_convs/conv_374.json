    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to define a new currency and I was wondering, what's the purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to 1?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there is no purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to 1 when defining a new currency. In fact, setting `proofprotocol` to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID, allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. So, if you want to control who can mint new coins, you should set `proofprotocol` to 2.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering, is there a way to reset the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are no instructions for resetting the mainnet. The instructions for resetting the testnet involve deleting the `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest` directories on Linux. But I wouldn't recommend trying to reset the mainnet, as it's a live network and could cause issues.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question: can anyone mint new coins in the \"mycoin\" currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, only the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins in the \"mycoin\" currency, since `proofprotocol` is set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID). This ensures that only the designated controller has the authority to mint new coins.",
