    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a few more questions about Verus. How do the fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or liquidity pool usage get distributed back to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, and no rent goes back to the Verus blockchain. The connectivity between blockchains is seamless, with no fees being sent back to Verus. It's a decentralized system that allows for efficient and secure interactions between different blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! I also had a question about crowdfunding currency launches on the Verus blockchain. I was told that they always require a minimum of 50% participation from the worldwide community in the preferred currencies on-chain. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's not correct. With Verus, you can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on-chain, but it's not fixed at 50%. If by the start time of your blockchain, the minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. You have control over the requirements for your crowdfunding campaign, and it's flexible to fit your needs.",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.
