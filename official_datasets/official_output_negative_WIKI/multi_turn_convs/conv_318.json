    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `gettransaction` method, and I'm having some trouble with the arguments. Can you help me out? Specifically, how do I specify a transaction hash in the \"includeWatchonly\" argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou're misunderstanding how the arguments work. You don't specify a transaction hash in the \"includeWatchonly\" argument. \"includeWatchonly\" is a boolean argument that determines whether to include watchonly addresses in balance calculation and details. The transaction id is specified in the \"txid\" argument, which is a required string argument. Does that clear things up?\n\n**User:**\nSo if I understand correctly, I need to provide both the \"txid\" and \"includeWatchonly\" arguments? Can I omit the \"txid\" argument and only provide the \"includeWatchonly\" argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot omit the \"txid\" argument. The \"txid\" argument is required, and it specifies the transaction id. The \"includeWatchonly\" argument is optional, and it defaults to false if not provided. You need to provide a value for \"txid\" in order to use the `gettransaction` method.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question: What is the default value of the \"txid\" argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is no default value for the \"txid\" argument. It is a required string argument, and you must provide a value for it. You can't just leave it blank or assume a default value will be used. You need to specify the transaction id explicitly.",
