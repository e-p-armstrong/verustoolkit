    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST from a single address to multiple recipients, but I'm not sure how to do it without specifying the amounts for each recipient. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the `sendcurrency` API does not support sending VRSCTEST to multiple recipients without specifying the amounts for each recipient. The provided examples show that you need to specify the amount for each recipient, such as `{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}` and `{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}`. You'll need to specify the amount for each recipient individually.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Thanks for clarifying that. I also had a question about testnet coins/currencies. Do they have any value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. They're solely for testing purposes, so you don't need to worry about their value. Do you have any other questions about using the `sendcurrency` API or working with testnet coins?",
