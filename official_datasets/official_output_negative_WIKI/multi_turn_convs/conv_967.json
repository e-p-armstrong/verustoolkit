    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm considering using the Verus software, but I want to make sure I understand the terms. Is the software provided with a warranty that guarantees it will not cause any damage?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! Unfortunately, the answer is no. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. The authors and copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. You should be aware of this before using the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Another question I have is, is the software fully tested and ready for production use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the software is explicitly stated to be experimental and unfinished. It is recommended to use it at your own risk. You should be aware that it may not be stable or reliable, and it's not recommended for production use. It's still in the development stage, and you should use it with caution.",
