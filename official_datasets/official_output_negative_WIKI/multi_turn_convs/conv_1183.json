    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with converting currencies. Can you help me out? I'm trying to get 1 GOLD for each VRSCTEST I convert using the command:\n```\nST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nHow do I make that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! Unfortunately, you won't get 1 GOLD for each VRSCTEST you convert. You will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. The conversion rate is not 1:1.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I have another question. Can I create a custom coin that can only be converted to with VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can create a custom coin that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, not just VRSCTEST. The conversion options are limited to those two currencies.",
