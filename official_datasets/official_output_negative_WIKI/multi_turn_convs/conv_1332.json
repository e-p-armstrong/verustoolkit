    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm a bit concerned about downloading the Verus software. Does the Verus Coin Foundation recommend using antivirus software from Avast and Kaspersky to ensure safe downloads?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus Coin Foundation does not recommend using antivirus software from Avast and Kaspersky to ensure safe downloads. In fact, Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program), which is a warning that the software may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. Instead, the Verus Coin Foundation provides a way to verify the downloads using a signature and checksum to ensure their authenticity. Would you like to know how to verify the downloads?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please! How do I verify the download using the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature provided in the txt file?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the download by extracting the downloaded archive, verifying the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extracting the archive to the desired directory. The CLI examples provided show how to verify the file directly or using a checksum. For example, you can use the command `./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" ...` to verify the file directly, or `./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" ...` to verify using a checksum. If the signature is valid, the result will be `true`. Do you have any questions about the verification process?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. What are the major updates included in the v0.7.3-10 release of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.7.3-10 release of Verus includes minimal updates targeted at networking robustness, specifically faster response to notary inconsistencies and a check for detecting a corrupt index that might otherwise prevent a node from staying synced. These updates are focused on improving network connectivity and robustness.",
