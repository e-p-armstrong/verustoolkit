    "You don't need a Bridge.PBaaSChain address to send currency from PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST. The `via` parameter in the `sendcurrency` command is used to specify the bridge to use for the transfer, which in this case is Bridge.PBaaSChain. This is a bridge that facilitates the transfer of currency between the two chains, but it's not an address that needs to be owned or controlled by the user.",
