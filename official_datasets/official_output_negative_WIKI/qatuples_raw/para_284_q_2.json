    "Is it true that the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a centralized marketplace controlled by a single entity?",
    "No, the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is not a centralized marketplace. It's a decentralized marketplace where you can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain, execute transactions peer-to-peer without intermediaries, and still have the option to share proceeds with value-added agents or other participants if desired.",
    "Our next step is the testnet rollout of the Ethereum bridge, and after a few days of that proving out in final testing and review, we will deploy it on mainnet as soon as we believe it is ready for permanent use. Once the Ethereum bridge is live on mainnet, if we do ever need a contract upgrade, we will announce and coordinate with network validators, as each Ethereum contract upgrade will be independently subject to Verus miner and staker approval.Thanks everyone for upgrading as soon as you are able!### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.",
