    "How do I reset the mainnet by deleting directories?",
    "The question is flawed because the text only provides instructions for resetting the testnet, not the mainnet. The instructions are to delete specific directories on Linux, but this is specifically for the testnet (VRSCTEST) and not for the mainnet. There is no information provided about how to reset the mainnet.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n## Testnet Reset Instructions\n**Please delete the following directories before launching the testnet:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/VRSCTEST\n~/.verustest\n```",
