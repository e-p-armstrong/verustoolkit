    "How do I use the Verus API to retrieve all currencies that have less than 1000 VRSC in reserve?",
    "The Verus API actually retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, not less than 1000 VRSC. The `getcurrencyconverters` command is used to retrieve all currencies that meet certain conditions, including having at least 1000 VRSC in reserve and a VRSC reserve ratio greater than 10%.",
    "verters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nWill return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
