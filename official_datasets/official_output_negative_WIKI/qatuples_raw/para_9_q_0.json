    "Why do I need to manually synchronize my daemon after invalidating a block and reconsidering a correct blockhash?",
    "You don't need to manually synchronize your daemon after invalidating a block and reconsidering a correct blockhash. According to the instructions, once you've invalidated the incorrect block and reconsidered the correct one, your daemon will quickly synchronize with the correct chain once it connects to a node that is on the correct chain.",
    "### CLI\n1. Search for the **earliest** block that not matches the blockchain:\n  `./verus getblockhash <suspected blocknumber>` will show you the blockhash for the blocknumber you filled in\n  The response will be similar to this:\n  `5cc7844973fb95ef17f1772ea4aba579f0d8273fb0ee6064cd8e707d1056c646`\n2. Check the blockhash your command gave you against the blockhash the [explorer](https://explorer.verus.io) shows.\n3. If the blockhash from the explorer is different than yours, repeat steps 1 & 2 until you find the earliest block that is different.\n4. Use the **earliest incorrect blockhash** from your system to invalidate that block:\n  `./verus invalidateblock <earliest incorrect blockhash>`\n  The deamon will not give feedback on this command.\n5. Now use the **correct blockhash** that the explorer gave you for the block you just locally invalidated:\n  `./verus reconsiderblock <correct blockhash>`\n  Again the daemon will not give feedback on this command.\n6. Once your daemon connects to a node that is on the correct chain, it will quicly synchronize.\n  If needed you can either restart your daemon to force new connections or manually disconnect bad nodes.\n\n(submitted by @jimboscott, Edited by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-11-11.",
