    "Do VerusIDs and NFTs require a centralized marketplace to buy and sell?",
    "No, VerusIDs and NFTs do not require a centralized marketplace to buy and sell. Verus has a decentralized marketplace that allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain, directly and peer-to-peer, without any intermediaries necessary.",
    "6. **Introducing Restricted VerusID Staking for PBaaS Chains**: This release enables the stretch goal of restricted ID staking as an option for launching PBaaS chains. This option means that on such a PBaaS chain, only funds controlled by IDs with a parent of that PBaaS chain may stake blocks on that chain. When combined with restricted forms of ID issuance, whether approval or referral required and/or referral rewards, this capability opens up an entire new area for public/private blockchains and applications, as well as government, voting security, corporate, or organizational use cases.**(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**\n### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.",
