    "How do you identify a block that was mined through a transaction with a high fee?",
    "Actually, a block that was minted (staking reward) can be identified by a transaction with no fee, not a high fee. Specifically, the last transaction in your wallet will have no fee, be from the same address that it is to, and also be the address the coinbase is to.",
    "# Question: How do you know a block was minted (staking reward)?\n\nYou can see the following characteristics:\n1. a block hash without a lot of leading zeros\n2. a last transaction that in your wallet has no fee, is from the same address that it is to, which is also the address the coinbase is to (easiest confirmation) and\n3. The POS difficulty is encoded in the low 32 bits of the nonce with 96 of the next nonce bits as zero/reserved, then a random hash at the top half\n\n(submitted by @keda666)",
