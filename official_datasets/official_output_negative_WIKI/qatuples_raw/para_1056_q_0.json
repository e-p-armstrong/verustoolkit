    "How do I recover from missing the fork for this version by simply restarting Verus?",
    "You cannot recover from missing the fork for this version by simply restarting Verus. If you miss the fork at the specified time, you need to stop Verus and delete everything except your `wallet.dat` file in your data directory. The data directory location varies by operating system: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest` for Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` for Mac OS, and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest` for Windows 10.",
    "If you miss the fork for this version at the above time you can get back on the correct chain by stopping Verus and deleting deleting everything other than your wallet.dat file in your data directory at:\n- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest`## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n  ```## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)\nCreate transaction, get raw transaction data:\n  ```\n  verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n  verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n  ```\nTake the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:\n  ```\n  verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n  ```\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:\n  ```\n  verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n  ```## New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet\nWith an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions.
