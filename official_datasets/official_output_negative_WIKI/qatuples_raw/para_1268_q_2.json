    "Are VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology not suitable for estate planning and do not provide protection from lost or stolen private keys?",
    "VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology are actually designed to simplify estate planning and provide protection from lost or stolen private keys. They offer a fully self-sovereign manner of managing funds, identity, and estate planning, with the peace of mind that comes from knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.",
    "- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.",
