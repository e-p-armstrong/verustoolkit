    "How do I use the `getidentitieswithaddress` method to search for identities that do not contain a specific address?",
    "The `getidentitieswithaddress` method is actually used to search for identities that contain a specific address. It does not have an option to search for identities that do not contain a specific address. The `address` argument is required and specifies the address to search for in the primary addresses of the identities.",
    "#### Arguments:\n```json\n{\n  \"address\":\"validaddress\"   (string, required) returns all identities that contain the specified address in its primary addresses\n  \"fromheight\":n        (number, optional, default=0) Search for qualified identities modified from this height forward only\n  \"toheight\":n         (number, optional, default=0) Search for qualified identities only up until this height (0 == no limit)\n  \"unspent\":bool        (bool, optional, default=false) if true, this will only return active ID UTXOs as of the current block height\n}\n```\n#### Result:\n```json\n[                 (array) array of matching identities\n {identityobject},        (object) identity with additional member \"txout\" with txhash and output index\n ...\n]\n```\n####Examples:\n```bash\n> verus getidentitieswithaddress '{\"address\":\"validprimaryaddress\",\"fromheight\":height, \"toheight\":height, \"unspent\":false}'\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getidentitieswithaddress\", \"params\": ['{\"address\":\"validprimaryaddress\",\"fromheight\":height, \"toheight\":height, \"unspent\":false}'] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```### `getidentitieswithrecovery '{\"identityid\":\"idori-address\", \"fromheight\":height, \"toheight\":height, \"unspent\":false}'`",
