    "What's the main reason for the success of the first roll out of auto notarization?",
    "Actually, the first roll out of auto notarization was not successful. It encountered two issues: a notarization bug that caused notarizations to fork, and the generation of large and slow proofs. These issues led to the need to re-enable cross-chain notarization and make adjustments to the auto notarization protocol to reduce the required proof size and increase efficiency.",
    "#### What\u2019s New for TestNet\nThis release re-enables cross-chain notarization, and represents the completion of a great deal of learning from the first roll out of auto notarization. Basically, we encountered two issues:1) There was a notarization bug in a significantly updated approach that caused notarizations to fork, effectively simulating a worst case, unmitigated attack on the notarization system. While that did not cause the system to fail per se, it resulted in the generation of many perceived, although not real, notarization forks on the network.2) Due to our effort to err on the side of more evidence than we believed was sufficient with auto notarization, then optimize to reduce the proofs required, the protocol was simply taking too long and generating too large proofs to be reasonable, required, or what we need on mainnet in any real scenario.As a result, we will take a few days to change some parameters in the auto notarization protocol that will both reduce the total and maximum amount of proof required, as well as provide a sufficient level of cryptographic proof, similar in strength to the current proof model with more efficient and selective proof choices. We don\u2019t expect this important step to take long, and until then, we will leave testnet on the pre-PBaaS to mainnet preparatory state.",
