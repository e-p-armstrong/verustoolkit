    "Are Verus digital signatures based on a specific private key that can be verified against a public address?",
    "No, Verus digital signatures are not based on a specific private key that can be verified against a public address. They are based on Verus ID, which enables more advanced features and capabilities, such as revocation and recovery, friendly name aliases, and modifiable multi-sig signing, that are not found in traditional decentralized blockchain transactions.",
    "**The result will be true if the signature is valid.**\n```\ntrue\n```\n## New in v0.6.4-3\n- Added `z_viewtransaction` api: Gets detailed shielded information about an in-wallet transaction# Verus CLI v0.6.4-3### Worldwide Verifiable Digital Signatures for All!\nVerus digital signatures, based on Verus ID, offer the first worldwide verifiable, decentralized, single or multi-sig friendly-name signatures for content such as messages and files, authentication, and attestations, with full support for revocation and recovery in case of key loss or theft.Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables. It is also the foundation upon which many new applications and additional capabilities can be built.",
