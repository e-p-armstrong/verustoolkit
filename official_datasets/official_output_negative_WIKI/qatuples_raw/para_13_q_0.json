    "When using the Verus CLI on Windows, how do I format my commands to use single quotes instead of double quotes?",
    "Actually, on Windows, you should substitute the single quotes (`'`) with double quotes (`\"`) when formatting your commands. Additionally, when using double quotes within the command, you should escape them with a backslash (`\\\"`).",
    "# Question: How do I unshield my coin rewards and get them staking on CLI?### Important General Information`verus command \"<userinput>\"` needs to be entered literally, with `<userinput>` replaced by your specific userdata. So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address,\nso it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`.#### Remarks on Windows command line formatting:The CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS. On the native windows command prompt (`cmd.com`) the formatting is different.\n* In windows command prompt, substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character.\n* In windows command prompt, substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters.\n* In windows command prompt, omit the preceding `./`.Note: As an example, in Linux the command:\n`./verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> '[{\"address\":\"<my_transparent_address>\",\"amount\":<95.9998>}]'`\nshould be entered on the Windows command prompt as:\n`verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> \"[{\\\"address\\\":\\\"<my_transparent_address>\\\",\\\"amount\\\":<95.9998>}]\"`",
