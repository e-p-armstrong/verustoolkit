    "Why do I need to edit the `libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll` file to adjust the mining settings?",
    "You don't need to edit the `libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll` file to adjust the mining settings. The file that needs to be edited is actually `run.verushhash.bat`. The `libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll` file is a dependency library for the mining software, and it doesn't contain any configurable settings.",
    "- Change to the folder you put the three files from the downloaded archive in (`run.verushhash.bat`, `libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll` & `ccminer.exe`)\n - edit the `run.verushhash.bat`\n - The line, that needs to be adjusted:\n   `ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://na.luckpool.net:3956 -u REoPcdGXthL5yeTCrJtrQv5xhYTknbFbec.Donator -p d=6 -t 8`\n - adjust the line, so it looks like:\n   `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c start \"ccminerCPUv3.5 VerusPool\" /Low \"c:\\Miners\\CCminer 2.0 CPU Release 3.5\\ccminer.exe\" -a verus -o stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -t 16`\n - make sure you replace the pool (`stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999`) with your prefered pool and the address\n  (`RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ`) with your own address. The address shown in this line is the veruscoin\n  foundation donation address. If desired change the identifier (`Donator`) to a name that easily identifies the\n  miner to you.\n - save and exit the file\n - run `run.verushhash.bat` to start mining.\n\nSubmitted by Oink.vrsc@\nNote: last revision date 2020-11-11.",
