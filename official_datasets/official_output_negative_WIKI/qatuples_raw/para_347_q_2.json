    "The question is flawed because it assumes that the `sendcurrency` API can be used to send funds from a public wallet address to a private wallet address. The text only provides examples of sending funds from a single address (e.g. `bob@`) or from all private wallet funds (`\"*Z\"`), but does not mention sending funds from a public wallet address to a private wallet address.",
