    "How do I verify a download without using the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands?",
    "The text actually explains how to verify a download using the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands. There is no mention of an alternative method. You can verify a download by extracting the archive, verifying the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and then extracting the archive to the desired directory. You can use the `verifyfile` command to verify the file directly or the `verifyhash` command to verify using a checksum.",

This had never been hit, as it would have been calculated incorrectly only if multiple chains experienced a challenge of two competing forks, but in that case, it would falsely reject any challenge proof. That would mean cross-chain challenges on mainnet, even though they were fine and fully tested on testnet, could fail and block a bridge until that calculation was made correct and the network upgraded.",
