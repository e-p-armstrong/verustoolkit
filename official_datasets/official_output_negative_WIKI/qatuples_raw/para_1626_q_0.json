    "Can you explain why the Verus wallet on ARM Linux stores its files in the `/usr/local/bin/VRSC` directory?",
    "The Verus wallet on ARM Linux does not store its files in the `/usr/local/bin/VRSC` directory. According to the documentation, the standard location for the `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata, and `VRSC.conf` files is `~/.komodo/VRSC`. However, on ARM installations, this directory is often stored on a mounted external hard drive, which means the actual path may be user-specified and non-standard.",
