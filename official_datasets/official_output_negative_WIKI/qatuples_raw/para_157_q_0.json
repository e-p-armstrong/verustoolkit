    "How does the `makeoffer` command allow for centralized, trusted third-party atomic swaps of blockchain assets?",
    "The `makeoffer` command does not facilitate centralized, trusted third-party atomic swaps of blockchain assets. It enables completely decentralized, fully on-chain atomic swap offers for decentralized swapping of any blockchain asset, including currencies, NFTs, identities, contractual agreements, and rights transfers, or as bids for on-chain auctions of any blockchain asset(s).",
    "### `makeoffer fromaddress '{\"changeaddress\":\"transparentoriaddress\", \"expiryheight\":blockheight, \"offer\":{\"currency\":\"anycurrency\", \"amount\":...} | {\"identity\":\"idnameoriaddress\",...}', \"for\":{\"address\":..., \"currency\":\"anycurrency\", \"amount\":...} | {\"name\":\"identityforswap\",\"parent\":\"parentid\",\"primaryaddresses\":[\"R-address(s)\"],\"minimumsignatures\":1,...}}' (returntx) (feeamount)`\nThis sends a transaction which provides a completely decentralized, fully on-chain an atomic swap offer for\ndecentralized swapping of any blockchain asset, including any/multi currencies, NFTs, identities, contractual\nagreements and rights transfers, or to be used as bids for an on-chain auction of any blockchain asset(s).\nSources and destination of funds for swaps can be any valid transparent address capable of holding or controlling\nthe specific asset.#### Arguments\n1. \"fromaddress\"       (string, required) The VerusID, or wildcard address to send funds from. \"\\*\", \"R\\*\", or \"i\\*\" are valid wildcards\n2. {\n   \"changeaddress\"     (string, required) Change destination when constructing transactions\n   \"expiryheight\"     (number, optional) Block height at which this offer expires. Defaults to 20 blocks (avg 1/minute)\n   \"offer\"         (object, required) Funds description or identity name, \"address\" in this object should be an address of the person making an offer for change\n   \"for\"          (object, required) Funds description or full identity description\n  }\n3. \"returntx\"        (bool, optional) default = false, if true, returns a transaction waiting for taker completion instead of posting\n4. \"feeamount\"        (value, optional) default = 0.0001",
