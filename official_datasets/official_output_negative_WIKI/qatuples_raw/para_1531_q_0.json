    "When creating an ID, how do the fees get distributed between the referrer and the blockchain developers?",
    "The fees don't actually get distributed between the referrer and the blockchain developers. According to the protocol, 20 VRSC each goes to the referrer's ID, the referrer's referrer's ID, and the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID. Additionally, 20 VRSC goes to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined. 100% of all funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain. There is no mention of blockchain developers receiving fees.",
