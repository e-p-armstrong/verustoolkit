    "Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag the software as a virus?",
    "Avast and Kaspersky do not flag the software as a virus. They may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that the software is mining software that could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and the software is not malicious.",
