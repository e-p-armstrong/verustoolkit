    "Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky not flag the Verus software as malicious?",
    "Actually, Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which are warnings that you are installing mining software that could be used to exploit your PC if installed by a third party. These warnings are false positives, and the software is not actually malicious.",
