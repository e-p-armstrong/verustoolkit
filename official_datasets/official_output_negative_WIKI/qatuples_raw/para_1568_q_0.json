    "How do I get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for a random block?",
    "You can't get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for a random block. The `getcurrencystate` command allows you to get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block, a specific block, or a range of blocks with a specific period between them. You need to specify the block number or range of blocks you're interested in.",
