    "How do I create a limited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network?",
    "You don't need to worry about creating a limited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. In fact, the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.",
    "arve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n#### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\": <Unlock block height>}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"setunlockdelay\": <Unlock block delay>}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve rati",
