    "How do I earn extra coins by cheating on the network?",
    "You shouldn't try to cheat on the network! In fact, the cheat catcher system is designed to detect and punish cheating behavior. If a miner or staker discovers a fork where the same winning coins are posted on two different forks, signed by the same person, they will create a transaction with cryptographic evidence of the cheating and submit it to the cheat catcher's address. This means that cheaters will actually lose coins, not gain them.",
    "- Once your cheat catcher address has been set, a **full node wallet that is mining OR staking, will also be looking for forks where the same winning coins may be posted on two different forks, signed by the same person.** If this is ever discovered, the the mining or staking wallet will create a transaction that has cryptographic evidence of the cheating and submit it for shielding to the cheat catcher\u2019s address. That means that while staking or mining, anyone who has a Sapling cheat catcher address set, may periodically find an additional shielded coinbase or two in their cheat catching address. **Earning cheat catching rewards does not new create coins, but actually takes them from cheaters, so DON\u2019T CHEAT :) !** Earning a cheat catching reward can also occur whether or not you earn a block reward and is available equally across the network to all miners and stakers, more dependent on who happens to observe the cheating fork and catches the cheater than on staking or mining power.## Version 0.4.0c also fixes the following issues reported in prior versions:\n- Wallet balance can get out of sync with blockchain when staking\n- Some non-Latin usernames cause failure to load\n- When used to load KMD in GUI Agama, Komodo stops accruing interest after transfer\n### IF YOUR WALLET IS OUT OF SYNC, YOU CAN RESCAN TO FIX THE PROBLEM.",
