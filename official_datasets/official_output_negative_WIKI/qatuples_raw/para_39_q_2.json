    "Can I use the example command and result provided in the text to create my own raw transaction?",
    "No, you should not use the example command and result provided in the text to create your own raw transaction. The text explicitly states that the example command and result are only examples and should not be used. You should use the results from your own wallet, generated by running the `createrawtransaction` command with your own specific parameters.",
    "To create a raw transaction, we will need to use the CLI-interface. In Verus Desktop\n`run createrawtransaction '[{\"txid\": \"yourtxid here\", \"vout\": fill in too}]' \"{\"destination addr\": <amount>}\" <current Blockheight -5>`1. adapt the above `createrawtransaction` command, making sure to subtract the 0.0001 VRSC free from the amount that is in the original TXID, similar to this example:\n```bash\nrun createrawtransaction '[{\"txid\": \"fa5962ebf61ef31867ba73b173433841f8f68578d53b4bb30cfe1432b5820f15\", \"vout\": 10}]' '{\"Oink@\": 2.20004763}' 890450\n```\nIn this example, the result is a long HEX-string:\n```json\n0400008085202f8901150f82b53214fe0cb34b3bd57885f6f841384373b173ba6718f31ef6eb6259fa0a00000000feffffff019b011d0d0000000024050403000000cc1b04030001011504575dc6ae7484c83c0dc97a4218f88e2cbe9b659c7552960d006e960d000000000000000000000000\n```\nCopy the string that your command gave as response, from the CLI interface of your wallet. You will need it in the next step.note: The above command and its result are examples. ***DO NOT*** use data from it. Use the results from your own wallet!",
