    "I've been mining for a week and haven't found a block yet. Doesn't that mean the formula for calculating the Average Time To Find One Block is wrong?",
    "Not necessarily. The formula for calculating the Average Time To Find One Block is based on the network hashrate, local hashrate, and block time. It provides an average time to find a block, not a guarantee that you'll find one within that timeframe. In reality, you may find a block much sooner or later than the calculated average time. It's all about probability and luck.",
    "[gimmick: math]()\n\n# Question: I'm mining since XYZ with XYZ, why I haven't found a block yet?\n\n$$ Average Time To Find One Block = ( \\frac{NetworkHashrate}{LocalHashrate} ) * BlockTime $$\n\nOne block = 6 coins (as now)\nNetworkHashrate = retrieved by `getmininginfo` command from </>CLI\nLocalHashrate = retrieved by `getmininginfo` command\nBlockTime = 60 seconds (average)\nnote: The above formula assumes you are already mining and your hashrate is already included in the `NetworkHashrate`. For very large LocalHashrate calculations (what-if-I-had scenario) add it to the NetworkHashrate yourself.\n\nReal example with - 31 threads AMD Ryzen 5950x @ 4.4Ghz -\n\n$$ Average Time To Find One Block = ( \\frac{851125882237}{46159950} ) * 60 $$\n$$ Average Time To Find One Block = 1,106,317 seconds (307 hours or little under 13 days) $$\n\nBear in mind that these are average times to find a block. In real life you may hit a block much sooner or later after finding the last. In the long run it averages out to the values predicted.\n\n(submitted by @TexWiller, edited by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nnote: last revision date 2023-06-21",
