    "How does the `OPTION_PBAAS` flag restrict a PBaaS chain to a single currency?",
    "The `OPTION_PBAAS` flag does not restrict a PBaaS chain to a single currency. It simply indicates that the chain is a PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) chain definition. If you want to restrict a PBaaS chain or gateway to a single currency, you would use the `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY` flag instead.",
    "oken, not a native currency\nOPTION_SINGLECURRENCY = 64       // for PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict to single currency\nOPTION_GATEWAY = 128          // if set, this routes external currencies\nOPTION_PBAAS = 256           // this is a PBaaS chain definition\nOPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER = 512     // this means that for a specific PBaaS gateway, this is the default converter and will publish prices\nOPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024  // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain\nOPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048        // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID\n```",
