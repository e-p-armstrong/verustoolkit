    "How do I use the `zcrawkeygen` command to send and receive confidential values on the blockchain?",
    "Actually, the `zcrawkeygen` command is deprecated, and it only generates a zcaddr, zcsecretkey, and zcviewingkey. It does not allow you to send and receive confidential values on the blockchain. The output of `zcrawkeygen` is a JSON object containing these three keys, but it does not provide a means to perform transactions.",
    "Note: The caller is responsible for delivering the output enc1 and enc2 to the appropriate recipients, as well as signing rawtxout and ensuring it is mined. (A future RPC call will deliver the confidential payments in-band on the blockchain.)\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n\"encryptednote1\": enc1,\n\"encryptednote2\": enc2,\n\"rawtxn\": rawtxout\n}\n```\n\n### `zcrawkeygen`\nDEPRECATED. Generate a zcaddr which can send and receive confidential values.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n \"zcaddress\": zcaddr,\n \"zcsecretkey\": zcsecretkey,\n \"zcviewingkey\": zcviewingkey,\n}\n```\n\n### `zcrawreceive zcsecretkey encryptednote`\nDEPRECATED. Decrypts encryptednote and checks if the coin commitments\nare in the blockchain as indicated by the \"exists\" result.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n \"amount\": value,\n \"note\": noteplaintext,\n \"exists\": exists\n}\n```\n\n### `zcsamplejoinsplit`\nPerform a joinsplit and return the JSDescription.\n\ncompiled by Oink.vrsc@, additions by Mike@, grewalsatinder@ and allbits@\n\nNote: last revision date 2024-05-03.",
