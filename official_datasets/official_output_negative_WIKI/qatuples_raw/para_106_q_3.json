    "Are softforks always enforced in the output?",
    "No, softforks are not always enforced in the output. The \"softforks\" field is an array that contains the status of softforks in progress, including their name, version, and enforcement progress. The \"enforce\" object within the softfork object shows the progress toward enforcing the softfork, but it does not mean that the softfork is always enforced.",
