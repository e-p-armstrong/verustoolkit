    "Can I register an identity using the `registernamecommitment` command?",
    "No, the `registernamecommitment` command is not used to register an identity. It is used to register a name commitment, which is a prerequisite for registering an identity. The actual identity registration is done using the `registeridentity` command.",

The name commitment hides the name itself while ensuring that the miner who mines in the registration cannot front-run the name unless they have also registered a name commitment for the same name or are willing to forfeit the offer of payment for the chance that a commitment made now will allow them to register the name in the future.",
