    "How does the current notification on the network hinder the launch of DeFi, multicurrency, and non-cross-chain functions?",
    "The current notification on the network does not hinder the launch of DeFi, multicurrency, and non-cross-chain functions. In fact, according to the text, all these functions are already enabled and the network has been running smoothly since activation.",
    "Having this notification remain in place until removed keeps the network running smoothly as it has been since activation, with all DeFi, multicurrency, and non-cross-chain functions enabled. Since the ETH bridge is undergoing final changes and review, is not quite ready to launch on testnet or mainnet, and will likely require at least a couple days on testnet to finish its review, we do not believe the current notification is hampering or slowing anything or anyone down at this time.\n### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see.
