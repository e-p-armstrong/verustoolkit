    "Are the command line formatting rules for Windows the same as those for Linux and MacOS?",
    "No, the command line formatting rules for Windows are different from those for Linux and MacOS. On Windows, you need to substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character, and substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters, whereas on Linux and MacOS, the formatting is as shown in the CLI help.",
    "# Remarks on Windows command line formatting:\n\nThe CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS. On the native windows command prompt (`cmd.com`) the formatting is different.\n\n* For windows substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character.\n * For windows substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters.\n\nNote: this only applies to giving commands from the windows command prompt. Verus Desktop will accept commands as listed.\n\nCreated by Oink.vrsc@\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-03-02.",
