            "You need to understand that VRSCTEST coins on the testnet have no real value and will be erased whenever the testnet is reset. Therefore, you can't send real VRSCTEST coins. You can, however, use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert testnet funds. For example, to send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nKeep in mind that these coins are only for testing purposes and have no real value.",
