            "Why do I need to verify the downloads using a third-party service, since Verus doesn't provide any built-in verification method?",
            "You don't need to use a third-party service to verify downloads. Verus provides a built-in method to verify downloads using the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands. These commands can be used to verify the signature of the downloaded archive using the extracted text file, which contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. The signer is \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\", and the commands can be used to ensure that the downloaded archive has not been tampered with.",
