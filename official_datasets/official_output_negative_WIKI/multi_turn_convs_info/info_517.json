            "The default setting for staking in Verus Coin 0.4.0 is actually **OFF**. This is to prevent multi-machine staking of the same coins or addresses. You can easily enable staking with the \"-mint\" parameter to verusd, \"setgenerate true 0\" with the \"verus\" CLI, or the staking button in the GUI.",

            "Can I stake on multiple machines with the same address or wallet without worrying about losing my block reward?",
            "No, you should not stake on multiple machines with the same address or wallet, unless you can be absolutely sure they are in sync and on the same chain at every block. If you do, you may lose your block reward to a cheat-catcher. It's recommended to only stake any address or wallet on one computer at a time.",
