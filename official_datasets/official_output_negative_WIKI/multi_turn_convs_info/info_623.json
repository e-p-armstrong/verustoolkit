            "What is the main purpose of digital signatures on the Verus Network?",
            "The main purpose of digital signatures on the Verus Network is to establish a reputation for authenticity and counter deep-fakes. They can be used by anyone, such as journalists, to ensure the authenticity of their work. Additionally, digital signatures have many other applications, including physical entry systems, workflow applications, and new earning opportunities.",
            "For example, using Verus ID signatures, it\u2019s possible for any journalist anywhere to sign photos, videos, and content, establish a reputation for authenticity, and counter the potential for deep-fakes to make the truth harder to find. Open source projects can now create their own identities and digitally sign their binary releases, ensuring that not only can a file be verified by hash as the one downloaded from a particular server, but by signature as the actual file initially signed by the developer or release engineer. Signatures also form the basis for any attestation of one party to the validity of another. In fact, there are so many applications for digital signatures, from things listed already, to physical entry systems, to workflow applications, to new earning opportunities that a full discussion of use cases would overwhelm these release notes.\n\nIn any case, we are happy to release digital signatures for all, and we hope you enjoy using this new, simple capability, maybe even think of a new use case you\u2019d like to pursue yourself as a business opportunity on the Verus Network!",

            "Are digital signatures on the Verus Network only useful for a few specific cases like photo and video authentication?",
            "No, digital signatures on the Verus Network have a wide range of applications beyond just photo and video authentication. They can be used for open source project binary releases, physical entry systems, workflow applications, and many other use cases. The possibilities are vast.",
