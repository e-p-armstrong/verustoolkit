            "Can you explain how Verus only supports creating tokens on the Verus chain itself and not on other blockchains?",
            "Verus actually enables users to create their own tokens on non-Verus systems, not just on the Verus chain itself. This is possible through the PBaaS (Platform-based Blockchain-as-a-Service) technology, which allows users to create their own tokens and even full-fledged blockchains that can interoperate with the Verus chain.",

All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon.

The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain.
