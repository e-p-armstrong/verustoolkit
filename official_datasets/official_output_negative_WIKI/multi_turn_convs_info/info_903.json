            "How do VerusIDs compromise user sovereignty by requiring central authority approval for creation and management?",
            "VerusIDs do not compromise user sovereignty by requiring central authority approval. In fact, VerusIDs are designed to be fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable. Anyone can create a VerusID without needing permission from a central authority, and the ID creator has complete control over their own ID. This self-sovereignty is a key feature of the VerusID protocol.",

When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user\u2019s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well.

            "Can Verus Vault be used to steal funds from a locked ID?",
            "No, Verus Vault is designed to prevent theft, not enable it. When an ID is locked using Verus Vault, funds under its control cannot be spent while locked. The unlock delay ensures that the ID owner has time to notice any potential key compromise and take action to prevent theft. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover the ID, which requires the ID owner's explicit action.",
