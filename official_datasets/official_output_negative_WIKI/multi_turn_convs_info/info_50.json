            "How do Bitcoin and its derivatives offer robust key management capabilities similar to centralized services, making them suitable for identity verification?",
            "Bitcoin and its derivatives do not offer robust key management capabilities similar to centralized services. In fact, a single public/private key pair in these systems lacks critical capabilities, such as the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, and privacy. This makes them unsuitable for identity verification. Verus ID, on the other hand, offers more advanced capabilities, including free verifiable digital signatures, making it a more suitable solution for identity verification.",
            "Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity.Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables. It is also the foundation upon which many new applications and additional capabilities can be built.",

            "Can you explain how Bitcoin's signing capability is equivalent to a full-fledged identity system?",
            "No, Bitcoin's signing capability is not equivalent to a full-fledged identity system. While it does offer some limited signing capability, it lacks many critical features necessary for a robust identity system, such as recoverability, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, and privacy. Verus ID, on the other hand, offers a more comprehensive identity system, enabling features like friendly name aliases, association of signed attestations, and more.",

            "No, Verus ID is not just a simple extension of Bitcoin's signing capability. It is a distinct protocol that offers a wide range of advanced capabilities, including free verifiable digital signatures, recoverability, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, and privacy, making it a more comprehensive identity system compared to Bitcoin's limited signing capability.",
