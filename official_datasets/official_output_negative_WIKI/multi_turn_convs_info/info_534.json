            "How do I start staking with VRSCs that are time-locked?",
            "You cannot start staking with VRSCs that are time-locked. To start staking, you need VRSCs that are not time-locked and are in your public/transparent wallet, and are at least 150 blocks old (or about 2.5 hours). Once your time-locked coins are unlocked, you need to transfer them to a private address and then to a public/transparent address before you can use them for staking.",
            "# Question: How does staking work?\n\nYou'll start staking with the first VRSCs that are not time locked + in your public / transparent wallet + 150 blocks old (or about 2.5 hours).\n\nYour chances to win a block: Your coins in your public/transparent wallet / Total staking supply in public/transparent wallets (which is max. about 485.000 VRSC from the first (sunrise) week as long as the rewards were below 192)\n\nRemember: There will be only one reward every minute. It\u2019s going to be either mining or staking, so on average 720 mining and 720 staking rewards every day.\n\nExample: I have 300 coins in a public/transparent address / 300.000 in public wallets (let's assume some part is lost/not staking or in private wallets), so that would be 1/1000 x 720 of a chance or around average 1,4 days for a staking block rewards. Hash power does not influence staking reward.\n\nRegarding the Verus debug.log: \u201c<DATE> No eligible staking transaction found\u201c. It means that you are staking but have not received a reward yet. @miketout will change the message soon.\n\nRegarding time locked coins:\nThe Zcash protocol requires you to send all coins received by mining (on wallet, not pool mining) or staking (reward transactions, also on wallet, not pool staking) once unlocked to a private address and then to a public/transparent address before you can use them either for staking or for making transactions (that\u2019s how you make use of your rewarded coins = coinbase coins). So, once your coins loose their time lock, you can unlock those coins as described in [\"Shield Verus Coins via Command Line Interface]\"(#!how-to/how-to_shield_via_cli.md). Once you've transferred the coins from your private address back to (one of) your public / transparent address(es) and you\u2019ll automatically start staking.\n\n(submitted by @karero, edited by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nnote: last revision date 2020-02-25.",
