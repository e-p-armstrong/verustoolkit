            "Can you explain why a locked VerusID cannot be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities?",
            "Actually, a locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. This provides an additional layer of security and allows for decentralized funds recovery.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.
