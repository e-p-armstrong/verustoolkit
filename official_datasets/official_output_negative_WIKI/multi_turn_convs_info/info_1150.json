            "Why do antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky never flag the Verus software as a potential threat?",
            "Actually, Avast and Kaspersky might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because they are warning users that the software is mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit the user's PC. It's not that the antivirus software never flags the Verus software, but rather, they might flag it due to its mining capabilities.",
