            "What is the process for reporting a bug in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross-chain protocols on the mainnet release?",
            "Actually, the bug bounty program is for reporting bugs on the testnet, not the mainnet release. The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty for the first 10 people to report any actual protocol bug on the testnet before the mainnet release.",
            "## Verus PBaaS and DeFi RC6 - BUG BOUNTIES\nAt this time, we are not aware of any bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross chain protocols on this version of testnet. We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all of the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release. While we don\u2019t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people (3 still unclaimed) who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended. If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.If you have reported a bug, since the bounties for the 0.9.5+ versions were announced, you are on the list, and someone from the Foundation will reach out to you in the near future.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the #pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for mainnet release this coming week, and start building your vision today!## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):",
