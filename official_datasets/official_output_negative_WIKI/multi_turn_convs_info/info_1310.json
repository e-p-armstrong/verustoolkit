            "What is the `z_getoperationresult` command used for, and how do you use it to get the total balance of funds stored in the node's wallet?",
            "The `z_getoperationresult` command is not used to get the total balance of funds stored in the node's wallet. Instead, it is used to get the result of a specific operation, specified by an operation ID. The command takes an array of operation IDs as an argument, and returns a list of JSON objects containing the results of those operations. To get the total balance of funds stored in the node's wallet, you would use the `z_gettotalbalance` command, which takes two optional arguments: `minconf` and `includeWatchonly`.",
            "#### Arguments:\n1. \"operationid\"     (array, optional) A list of operation ids we are interested in. If not provided, examine all operations known to the node.#### Result:\n\"  [object, ...]\"   (array) A list of JSON objectsExamples:\n```bash\n> verus z_getoperationresult '[\"operationid\", ... ]'\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_getoperationresult\", \"params\": ['[\"operationid\", ... ]'] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```### `z_getoperationstatus '[\"operationid\", ... ]'`\nGet operation status and any associated result or error data. The operation will remain in memory.#### Arguments:\n1. \"operationid\"     (array, optional) A list of operation ids we are interested in.
