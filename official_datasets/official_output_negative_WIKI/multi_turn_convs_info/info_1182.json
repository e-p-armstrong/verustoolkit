            "How does Verus Fee Pooling technology weaken blockchain security?",
            "Verus Fee Pooling technology actually strengthens blockchain security, rather than weakening it. This technology preserves the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time. This approach addresses the legitimate concerns expressed by Vitalik Buterin regarding ETH and ETH 2.0, and provides a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model.",

In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
