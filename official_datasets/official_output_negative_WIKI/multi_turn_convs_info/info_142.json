            "You can't initiate a currency launch immediately after defining the currency. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command to initiate a currency launch. Additionally, the currency launch will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.",
