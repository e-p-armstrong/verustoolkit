            "Actually, any user with an ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged blockchain on the Verus network, without needing to be a developer. This is one of the key features of the Verus protocol, which enables user-created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without requiring programming knowledge.",
