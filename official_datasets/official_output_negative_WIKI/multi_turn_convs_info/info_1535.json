            "The question is based on a flawed premise. The `getcurrencyconverters` command is used to list all currencies that have markets at or above a certain liquidity threshold, not to list currencies with a specific number of reserve currencies. To list currencies that have markets with both BTC and ETH, you can use the command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have markets with both BTC and ETH.",

            "The `getcurrencyconverters` command is used to list currencies that have markets with specific reserve currencies, not to list all currencies that have markets with any cryptocurrency.

If you want to list all currencies that have markets with any cryptocurrency, you would need to use a different command or approach.",
