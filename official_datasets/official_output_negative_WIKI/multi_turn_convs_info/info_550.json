            "Unfortunately, it's not possible to manually calculate the exact date when an immature block will mature without using any scripts or automation tools. The provided script is necessary to automate the calculation, as it takes into account the varying number of blocks per day (which is not always exactly 1440) to estimate the date. Without the script, you would need to constantly monitor the blockchain and perform complex calculations to estimate the maturity date.",
