            "How do I get the current price of VRSC in Euros using the VerusPay API?",
            "The VerusPay API doesn't directly support Euros as a currency option. However, you can use the `currency` option to get the price in other fiat currencies like USD or CAD. For example, to get the current price of VRSC in CAD, you can use `https://veruspay.io/api/?currency=cad`. If you need to get the equivalent price in Euros, you would need to use an external exchange rate API or service to convert the price from the supported fiat currency to Euros.",

            "Can I use the VerusPay API to get the price of any cryptocurrency?",
            "No, the VerusPay API is specifically designed to provide price information for VRSC (Verus) and ARRR (Pirate Chain) cryptocurrencies. It does not support other cryptocurrencies. If you need price information for other cryptocurrencies, you would need to use a different API or service.",
