            "Why do I need to delete my entire wallet and start from scratch when upgrading to the latest version of the Verus Wallet?",
            "You don't need to delete your entire wallet and start from scratch. In fact, the procedure specifically instructs you to backup essential files such as `wallet.dat` and `VRSC.conf` to a safe location, and then restore them later. This ensures that your wallet data and configuration are preserved during the upgrade process.",

Go to `VRSC Wallet location`\n\tb. copy `wallet.dat` to a *SAFE* location\n\tc. copy `VRSC.conf` to a *SAFE* location\n\td. Verify that both files are copied to your safe location\n3.
