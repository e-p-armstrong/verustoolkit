            "How do I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve all currencies that have a market capitalization of over $1 billion?",
            "The `getcurrencyconverters` API does not filter results by market capitalization. Instead, it retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. If you want to retrieve currencies that have a market with a specific pair (e.g., BTC/ETH), you can use the API with the desired currency codes, like this: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth`.",
