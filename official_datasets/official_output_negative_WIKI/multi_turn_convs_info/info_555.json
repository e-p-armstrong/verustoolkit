            "How does Verus Vault ensure the security of funds by allowing anyone with primary keys to immediately spend or access them?",
            "Verus Vault doesn't work like that. In fact, even with primary keys, including multisig primary keys, you must first unlock and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before you can spend or access funds. This delay allows the revocation and recovery authority identities to intervene in case of an unauthorized unlock, providing an additional layer of security and decentralized funds recovery.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet\nWith an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions. Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.",
