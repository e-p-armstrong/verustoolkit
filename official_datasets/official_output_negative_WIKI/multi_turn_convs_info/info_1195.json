            "How does Verus Vault allow anyone with the primary keys to immediately spend or access funds from a locked VerusID?",
            "That's not correct. Verus Vault actually requires anyone with the primary keys to first unlock the ID and then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This provides an additional layer of security and allows for decentralized fund recovery in case of unauthorized access.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.

            "Does Verus Vault provide any protection against the 5 dollar wrench attack?",
            "Yes, it does. Verus Vault provides a decentralized solution to the 5 dollar wrench attack by allowing users to set a delay on their locked IDs, such as a 24-hour unlock delay. This means that even if someone tries to access the funds by using physical coercion, the delay will prevent them from doing so, giving the rightful owner time to revoke and recover their funds.",
