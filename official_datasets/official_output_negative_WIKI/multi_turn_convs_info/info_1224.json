            "What is the main purpose of the Verus Vault, which is to allow users to spend their funds immediately after locking their ID?",
            "The main purpose of the Verus Vault is not to allow users to spend their funds immediately after locking their ID. In fact, the Verus Vault's primary use case is to timelock an ID, which prevents any spending of funds controlled by that ID while still allowing the ID and its funds to be used for staking. This feature is designed to provide an additional layer of security and protection against theft.",
            "The Verus Vault use case, which was originally described in the conception of the feature, is the ability to timelock an ID, which would prevent any spending of any funds controlled by that ID, while still allowing the ID and all its funds to be used for staking. If the timelock was set for one day when locked, the unlock operation itself will require a waiting period of one day, which can only be circumvented by a revocation followed by recovery operation. In practice, this means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds (though they could stake them and delegate rewards to another address, which you could immediately see) unless they unlock the ID first and wait one day. If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone other than you, you can revoke and recover before any funds are lost at all. If you wanted to get extremely secure, to the point of covering a case where someone may steal your private keys without you knowing and then lay in wait until you unlock your identity, so they can pounce on your funds before you lock it again, you can actually modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it, which ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys. While we believe this unique Verus technology actually provides for fully theft-proof workflows and protection of all assets on the network under the control of an ID, we will generally refer to the technology as \"theft-resistant\" and disclaim all guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose as part of the \"experimental software\" disclaimer.",

            "If someone compromises your private keys while your ID is locked, they can simply unlock the ID and immediately access your funds, right?",
            "No, that's not correct. If someone compromises your private keys while your ID is locked, they cannot simply unlock the ID and access your funds. The unlock operation itself requires a waiting period, which can only be circumvented by a revocation followed by a recovery operation. This means that even if someone compromises your private keys, they cannot spend your funds without waiting for the unlock period to expire, giving you time to notice and take action to protect your assets.",
