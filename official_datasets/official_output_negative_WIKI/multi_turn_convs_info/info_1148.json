            "Can you explain why Verus Vault is only useful for theft resistance and delayed lock opening, and has no other potential use cases?",
            "Actually, Verus Vault has many potential use cases beyond theft resistance and delayed lock opening. It can be used to provide standard forms of time-locking, such as providing time-locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time-locked deal and payment terms. The technology has many potential uses that have not been thought of yet, and its capabilities are more extensive than just the two mentioned.",
            "In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g.

            "How do I use Verus Vault to revoke an identity that has a time lock or delay set on it?",
            "Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. However, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. So, to revoke an identity with a time lock or delay, you would need to use a different identity or mechanism that has the authority to revoke it.",
