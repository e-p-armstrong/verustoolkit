            "How does Verus PBaaS limit the scale of its decentralized platform?",
            "Verus PBaaS does not limit the scale of its decentralized platform. In fact, it offers unlimited scale, decentralized capabilities. The Verus community has focused on creating a platform that can handle a wide range of use cases, rather than convincing others of its potential.",
            "As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today\u2019s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.## The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.## Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID\n- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.\n## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)\n- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user\u2019s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implement",

            "Is VerusID a centralized identity system?",
            "No, VerusID is not a centralized identity system. It is a self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable identity system that enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses. This means that users have full control over their identities and can manage them without relying on a central authority.",

            "Can Verus Vault be used to steal funds from a locked identity?",
            "No, Verus Vault is designed to prevent theft, not enable it. When an identity is locked using Verus Vault, the funds under its control cannot be spent until the unlock delay is reached. Even then, the only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover the ID, which requires the user's permission. This makes it virtually impossible for someone to steal funds from a locked identity.",
