            "What is the main difference between the Verus Protocol and other blockchain protocols, which is that the Verus Protocol requires an ICO to launch a new currency?",
            "Actually, the Verus Protocol does not require an ICO to launch a new currency. In fact, it launched its mainnet in 2018 without an ICO, preallocation of funds, or development fees. The Verus Protocol is designed to be a decentralized, transparent, and community-driven platform, which allows individuals, projects, organizations, or communities to create their own currencies, fundraising platforms, voting networks, and more, without the need for an ICO or middlemen.",
