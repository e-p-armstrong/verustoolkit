            "How do Verus developers plan to implement liquidity pools and token conversions using multiple smart contracts?",
            "Actually, Verus developers have chosen to implement liquidity pools and token conversions using a single mechanism, not multiple smart contracts. Users and liquidity providers use the same mechanism to achieve their goals, which involves transactions with a multi-reserve currency that acts as the pool. This approach eliminates the need for separate smart contracts for users and providers.",
            "tant.\nThere is also a fundamental difference in how Verus developers have chosen to implement liquidity pools and token conversions. In Ethereum, the users (converters of tokens) interact with different smart contracts than do the liquidity providers. They operate on different sides of the playing field, so to speak, only meeting occasionally to transact. In Verus, however, users and providers are using the exact same mechanism to achieve their ends \u2014 they each issue the same transactions, converting to, from or through an asset known as a multi-reserve currency. This new asset is, in effect, the pool. When a user wishes to convert from one token to another, they can conduct two successive transactions, first entering the \u201cpool\u201d by acquiring the multi-reserve currency, then, in the subsequent block, exiting the \u201cpool\u201d to the target currency. Or, they can elect to convert directly from reserve to reserve using a single \u201cvia\u201d transaction, through the \u201cpool\u201d. These conversion transactions are accomplished by simple \u201csending\u201d transactions, as easily as one would typically send a single cryptocurrency. Prices do not need to be selected as the user will be able to observe the price from the last block, understand the typical changes from block to block, and transact at the \u201cmarket\u201d price. The market price is the same fair, solved price for all users who transact in a block.\nReduced Costs and Risks for Liquidity Providers\nThe Verus system drives the marginal cost for provision of liquidity to zero, with the exception of the phenomenon known as \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d. There are no smart contracts to audit \u2014 no unintended scenarios for poorly written contracts that will lead to catastrophic loss. Impermanent loss is dealt with through a fee of 0.025% that is paid to the \u201cpool\u201d holders by every conversion that goes directly from \u201creserve\u201d to \u201creserve\u201d. The phenomenon of impermanent",
