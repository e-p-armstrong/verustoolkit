            "How do Verus currency conversions work if they require a buyer or seller on the other side of the transaction?",
            "Actually, Verus currency conversions don't require a buyer or seller on the other side of the transaction. Conversions are protocol conversions, not traditional buy or sell transactions. This means that you don't need someone to buy from or sell to in order to convert your currency. The conversion happens automatically, and the conversion rate (price) is adjusted according to market-based mathematical formulas.",
            "ve currency conversion is built into the blockchain protocol, charges no centralized fees, addresses the infamous front-running problem, and can be mined and staked while emitting new coins in the process, the model is very similar to Bancor reserves. The Bancor whitepaper is a good place to start if you want an introduction into cryptographic fractional reserve currencies and how conversions work. At any time and for virtually any volume, Verus will be convertible in a fully automatic way between Verus and native fractional reserve currencies through simple transactions and PBaaS reserve protocols.\nImportantly, conversion is not a buy or a sell from or to another individual, it is a protocol conversion. To convert any amount, you need no buyer on the other side of a \u201csell\u201d and no seller in order to buy. Converting to a currency will cause the currency conversion rate (price) to rise, according to proven, market-based mathematical formulas, and converting from will have the opposite effect.\nWith PBaaS reserve currencies, there cannot be a shortage of liquidity across the ecosystem, since the order books are always the entire supply and reserve of the currency. In addition, currency can be sent automatically from the Verus blockchain to a PBaaS reserve blockchain, arriving to the specified address as either Verus Reserve Tokens, or auto-converted at the current market price (causing the price to rise slightly according to the reserve currency formulas) to the native currency of the destination chain. Unlike complex APIs that make cross-chain operations difficult for the average user, the latest big advance in this area is a protocol that makes it as easy to send from one chain to another as it is today to send a simple transaction.\nVerus fractional reserve currencies will have decentralized capabilities and benefits that are fundamentally new both to crypto and also to",
