            "Can you explain how most leading blockchain networks today were initially decentralized through ICOs or large pre-mines, rather than a fairly launched protocol?",
            "That's not correct. Most leading blockchain networks today were initially centralized through ICOs or large pre-mines, rather than a fairly launched protocol, which is the opposite of what you're saying. This centralization has led to a lack of focus on designing or implementing core protocol primitives, such as currencies or identities, beyond one native currency.",
