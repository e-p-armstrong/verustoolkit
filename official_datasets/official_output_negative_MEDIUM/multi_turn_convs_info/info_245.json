            "How do corporations control VerusIDs?",
            "VerusIDs are self-sovereign, which means that you have complete ownership and control over your VerusID through the use of private keys. No one besides you has control over your VerusID unless you choose to give them permission. It's a permissionless system, so anyone in the world can create a VerusID without needing permission from a central authority or corporation.",
            "most important features of VerusID:\nSelf-sovereign: you have complete ownership and control over your VerusID through the use of private keys. No one besides you has control over your VerusID unless you choose so. It is a permissionless system, so anyone in the world can create a VerusID.\nRevocable and recoverable: when creating a VerusID, you can specify a revoke ID and a recover ID. Verus believes that this functionality is critical for any system of self-sovereign identities; users need a path to recover their identities if their private keys are lost or stolen, otherwise there is just too much risk in a self-sovereign system where an identity can become inaccessible with a single mistake. It\u2019s now possible for the first time ever that you can recover from private key loss or theft in a completely decentralized, self-sovereign way.\nFriendly name: a VerusID is a blockchain address that can also hold funds, and stake its VRSC. This is an improved system for holding and receiving funds, as users now have a friendly, human-readable name, e.g. Verus Coin Foundation@, to receive, send and secure all their cryptocurrencies. It means, too, that funds held in a VerusID address are recoverable in the event of private key loss.\nMultisig: each VerusID can function as a multisig address, thus making it possible to be controlled by multiple people. In this way, new methods are provided for organizations or groups of people to work together.\nThere is more: with VerusID you also have z-addresses (Sapling) for private transactions and messages, and you can create unforgeable signatures for messages and for signing files. Furthermore you can transfer a VerusID to another address, including all of its UTXOs!\nEarn VRSC with Referrals\nVerusID has a referral system in which anyone can earn VRSC. Referrals go back 3 levels as part of the blockchain rules. An unreferred VerusID costs 100 ",

            "Are VerusIDs only usable for cryptocurrency transactions?",
            "No, VerusIDs are more than just a cryptocurrency address. They can hold funds, stake VRSC, and also serve as a friendly, human-readable name for receiving, sending, and securing all your cryptocurrencies. Additionally, VerusIDs have other features such as multisig functionality, z-addresses for private transactions and messages, unforgeable signatures, and more.",
