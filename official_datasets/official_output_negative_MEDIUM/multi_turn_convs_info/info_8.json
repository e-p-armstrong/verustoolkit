            "According to the predictable and transparent monetary policy of Verus, the block reward is increased every two years. Can you explain how this benefits miners and stakers?",
            "Actually, the block reward is halved every two years, not increased. This means that the number of coins coming into circulation is reduced, which can have implications for miners and stakers. However, with the upcoming PBaaS-mainnet upgrade, the Fee Pool economy will provide higher block rewards for miners and stakers, offsetting the effect of the halving.",
