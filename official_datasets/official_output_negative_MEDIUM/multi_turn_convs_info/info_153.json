            "Actually, the opposite is true. Verus offers more functionality and capabilities than smart contract platforms, without requiring an enormous engineering effort to bring together multiple interoperating complex smart contracts. Verus provides additional capabilities such as privacy enhancement, moral hazard resistance, and easy group dynamics, making it a more comprehensive solution.",

            "Don't social tokens require a lot of programming and engineering effort to create?",
            "No, that's not the case. Experiments to prove the concepts of social tokens on Verus require no programming, are risk-free, and extremely low cost. The core protocols already exist, and tooling and apps can be built out through a collective effort.",

            "Aren't social tokens on Verus just a rehash of the same old ERC-20 tokens?",
            "No, social tokens on Verus offer more than just digital scarcity. They can emerge automatically, without programming, as ERC-20s, and also provide decentralized bridges to Ethereum, giving users the best of both worlds. They are intelligent, next-generation social tokens that offer more capabilities and functionality than traditional ERC-20 tokens.",
