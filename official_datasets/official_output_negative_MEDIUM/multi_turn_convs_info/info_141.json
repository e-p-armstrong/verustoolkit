            "How do I stake my Verus Coin (VRSC) without having a mature balance?",
            "You can't stake your Verus Coin (VRSC) without having a mature balance. A balance in Verus needs to be \"mature\" (in the form of a UTXO) and have at least 150 block confirmations to actively stake on the blockchain.",
            "Success! Your Lite mode wallet address is now a part of your wallet.dat file.\nPart 4 \u2014 Earn More VRSC by Staking Verus Coin!\nYou can also participate in Staking using the Native mode of the Verus wallet, activating staking by having a VRSC mature balance and starting Staking from the same Mining button in Agama.\nStaking is a great way to keep earning VRSC on your mined rewards or any VRSC you purchased on an exchange. For a balance in Verus to actively stake on the blockchain, it needs to be \u201cmature\u201d , in the form of a UTXO(s) and have at least 150 block confirmations as such.\nA newly mined or minted (won from staking) block will mature after 100 block confirmations (about 100 min). After reaching maturity, because it came from the coinbase, it needs to first be shielded and unshielded, which results in a UTXO (unspent transaction output).\nIf the VRSC in your wallet balance comes from someone else, is paid out from your pool mining efforts, or is from an exchange buy, it\u2019s already in UTXO format and will begin staking within 150 block confirmations of coming into your wallet (as long as Staking is enabled on the wallet).\nLet\u2019s talk about how to shield coins you mined from solo mining or minted from staking!\nStep 1\nGenerate a new shielded wallet address. This is a 1 time step, once you\u2019ve generated it, you can keep using it for future shielding/unshielding. To create your \u201czs\u201d address, in Verus Agama first click Receive, then click \u201cGet New Address\u201d and select \u201cPrivate Address (Sapling)\u201d. You\u2019ll see a confirmation in the lower right that it generated a new address.Step 2\nNow copy the new \u201czs\u201d address you generated by clicking the 3 vertical dots next to it and selecting \u201ccopy pub key\u201d.

            "Can I start staking my VRSC immediately after mining or buying it on an exchange?",
            "No, you can't start staking your VRSC immediately after mining or buying it on an exchange. If the VRSC comes from someone else, is paid out from your pool mining efforts, or is from an exchange buy, it will begin staking within 150 block confirmations of coming into your wallet (as long as Staking is enabled on the wallet). If it's a newly mined or minted block, it needs to mature after 100 block confirmations (about 100 min) and then be shielded and unshielded, resulting in a UTXO, before it can be staked.",
