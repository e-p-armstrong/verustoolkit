            "The Verus blockchain doesn't prevent cheating by simply not allowing users to stake on forked or orphaned blocks. Instead, it allows users to stake on multiple chains, but then uses a mechanism to detect and punish cheating behavior. When a cheater like Jamie tries to \"double spend\" by casting votes on both the main chain and a forked or orphaned block, the blockchain's security mechanism kicks in. The reward for the cheat attempt is caught by a scanner like Stacy, who can then claim the reward for themselves and expose the cheating behavior on the blockchain.",
