            "How do you create a new blockchain on the Verus network without a VerusID?",
            "To create a new blockchain on the Verus network, you need to have the VerusID name of the chain. Without a VerusID, you cannot create a new blockchain. VerusIDs are necessary to launch a new chain, and each chain is independent and customizable.",
            "Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS): Launch Your Own Blockchain\nVerus sees a future where anyone can create their own blockchain in an easy fashion. Every blockchain in the ecosystem is independent and customizable. To create a chain one needs to have the VerusID name of the chain.\nChains can be nested to any level, so that a chain, say \u201cNewChain\u201d, that is launched with a VerusID on the main Verus blockchain, can be used to spawn an unlimited amount of new chains, each of these using identities on NewChain, which can be acquired at any cost as selected by the creator of NewChain.\nNew chains inherit the 50/50% PoW/PoS consensus mechanism. This percentage might be customizable in the future.\nA newly created chain can be mined by the miners of VerusCoin. A miner in the VerusCoin ecosystem can mine up to 22 different PBaaS-chains without losing any of the original hash power. This is called Merge-Mining and means that a creator of the chain doesn\u2019t have to worry about creating their own mining infrastructure.\nPBaaS chains will form the basis for a practically unlimited scalability of the Verus system. Popular currencies and tokens can exist and be interchangeable on many Verus blockchains, so that they won\u2019t be restricted or limited by the capacities of a single blockchain.\nA chain can have certain characteristics like launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund. Other options include dynamic coin launch pricing based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carve outs, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations. Additionally the creator can specify coin supply, coin emission with up to three era\u2019s and define the price for identities. All specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary.Multi-Reserve Currencies: DeFi Reimagined\nVerus is curren",

            "Can a PBaaS chain have a custom consensus mechanism?",
            "Newly created PBaaS chains inherit the 50/50% PoW/PoS consensus mechanism from the main Verus blockchain. While this percentage might be customizable in the future, currently, PBaaS chains do not have custom consensus mechanisms.",
