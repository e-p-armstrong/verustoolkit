            "What's the status of the centralized Ethereum-Verus bridge, and how can I use it?",
            "There is no centralized Ethereum-Verus bridge. Instead, the bridge is decentralized and is currently live on Rinkeby and Verus Testnet. You can try it out with MetaMask or by downloading Verus Desktop or CLI and activating the Verus Testnet blockchain. The community is also testing and hardening the bridge for deployment on mainnet.",

Users will be able to buy, sell, and make offers on VerusIDs without any intermediaries.

More details later.\nVerUSD Stablecoin\nVerus and Valu announce a fully compliant stablecoin for the Verus ecosystem and beyond. The US dollar stablecoin is called VerUSD, is 100% backed with dollar collateral and is FDIC insured. The issuance of the stablecoin is transparent, auditable and controlled by code.
