    "What kind of applications are being built around Verus, considering it's still in the planning stages and hasn't implemented any protocols yet?",
    "Verus has actually already implemented some protocols on its mainnet, including payment, privacy, and identity. Additionally, Defi is operational on the testnet, and interoperability, blockchain creation, and data exchange are expected to join the testnet soon. These protocols serve as public infrastructure, enabling the development of various applications.",
    "s and then application systems are built around that, communicating through data. Verus has currently implemented payment, privacy and identity on its mainnet. Defi at the protocol level is in operation on testnet. Interoperability and blockchain creation is joining on testnet shortly, with data exchange to follow shortly thereafter.\nOnce these protocols are in place to serve as public infrastructure, Verus expects rapid uptake for users and developers of all kinds to continue building and using the applications of the new era.\nDiscuss and explore on Discord\nFollow us on Twitter\nGo to our website",
