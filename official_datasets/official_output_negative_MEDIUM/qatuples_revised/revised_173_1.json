    "Can you explain how social tokens on Verus are engineered using complex interconnecting smart contracts, similar to those found on other blockchain platforms?",
    "Social tokens on Verus are not engineered using complex interconnecting smart contracts. Instead, they are built using primitives as building blocks, which allows them to be issued in just a few minutes, with bespoke variables, by non-programmers, and at little cost. This approach makes it much simpler and more efficient than trying to engineer social tokens on other blockchain platforms using smart contracts.",
    " practice. Five years in development, and with a working network (minus these token capabilities) for the last three years, the Verus Project has built the protocols. Verus aims to be a public good. There are no VCs funding the project and so no returns on investment that need to be drawn from users to pay back investors. It is a community developed FOSS blockchain protocol. The only fees involved in creating and using social tokens on Verus will be paid, as in bitcoin, to miners who power the network.\nThese capabilities as described do not exist on smart contract platforms today. Perhaps they could be engineered on a case by case basis by a team of competent smart contract developers. But, this would require complex interconnecting smart contracts to deal with all of the disparate elements. It would be an enormous engineering effort, fraught with risk and complexity. On Verus, using primitives as building blocks, these tokens can be issued in just a few minutes, with bespoke variables, by non-programmers, and at little cost.\nAdditional Capabilities\nApart from the core functionality of social tokens described above, there are also some interesting capabilities that enhance the concept. First, as a fork of zcash, Verus offers private transactions on its native currency. And, as a UTXO blockchain, wallets control multiple addresses which cannot necessarily be traced to the same wallet. This gives the ability for intelligent apps to protect user\u2019s privacy as they interact with social tokens.\nAlso, on-chain escrow mechanisms allow for issuers to timelock their holdings for arbitrary periods. This helps reduce potential moral hazard where fans and speculators might be concerned about issuers dumping their holdings and \u201crugging\u201d their community. Roll has always been concerned about this possibility, and that led them to provide centralized escrow services for their issuers.",
