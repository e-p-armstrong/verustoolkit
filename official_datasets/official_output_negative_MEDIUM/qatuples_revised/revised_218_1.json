    "What is the purpose of \"options\":16 when creating a currency?",
    "\"options\":16 is not used when creating a currency. It is used to require referrals for subID creation.",
    "eation.\noptions:16 \u2014 Referrals are required for subID creation.\noptions:32 \u2014 The currency is a simple token currency without any reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized. This option is also used for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens.\noptions:2048 \u2014 A single satoshi (0.00000001) NFT token is created & has tokenized control of the root VerusID. Which means you can send the single satoshi token to other addresses and then they have control of the root VerusID.\nLet\u2019s give some examples of combined options:\n\"options\":33 \u2014 this launches a basket currency. It is options 1 + 32 combined.\n\"options\":2080 \u2014 this launches a single satoshi token that has control of the root VerusID. It is options 32 + 2048 combined.\n\"options\":35 \u2014 this launches a basket currency, and only the rootID can create subIDs. It is options 1 + 2 + 32 combined.\nAnd so on. More information on basket currencies, simple token currencies and subIDs in the next chapter.\nTwo Types of Currencies\nThere are two types of currencies that can be launched with the Verus Protocol. Basket currencies and simple token currencies. Both can be issued decentralized, or centralized (has minting and burning capabilities.)\nBasket Currencies\nA simple example of a basket currency containing two reserve currencies.\nBasket currencies are magical currencies that have reserves. Have a look at the simplified image. If anyone has currency X or Y, they can convert to the basket currency, or convert from reserve to reserve. If anyone has the basket currency, they can go to currency X or Y. A basket currency can have 1 and up to 10 reserve currencies.\nThe basket currency supply is dynamic, depending on how much is converted to the basket currency (supply minted), or back to its reserve(s) (supply burned).\nA basket currency can be 100% backed by its reserves, 5%, or anything in between. This is called the reserve ",
