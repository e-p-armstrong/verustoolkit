    "No, that's not correct. According to Verus, the decentralized internet will not emerge as a single, centralized \"global computer\" where all applications are programmed. Instead, it will consist of heterogeneous systems exchanging data that they can all understand, with some being centralized and others being decentralized. Functionality will be triggered from one system to another, with secure systems including their most important functions at the protocol level.",

Verus\u2019 philosophy is that the decentralized internet will not emerge as a system of applications all programmed on a single \u201cglobal computer\u201d but that it will consist of heterogeneous systems exchanging data that they can all understand (some centralized, some decentralized). Functionality will be triggered from one system to another. Secure systems will include their most important functions at the protocol level.Bell\u2019s Law states that \u201croughly every decade a new, lower priced computer class forms based on a new programming platform, network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new industry\u201d. Experience shows that this shift comes into effect invisibly at first, and its nature is only widely understood and recognized some five to seven years after the shift began.\nWe know that the latest Bell\u2019s Law transformation is upon us, and has been for some years, but there is still scant agreement on its specific nature. What we can say for certain, though, is that we are in dire need of a great leap forward in systems, services and usage. Our most recent computing paradigm has given us new toys, tools and businesses. But it has also brought giant internet monopolies that routinely abuse their power and stifle freedom, innovation and wealth creation. This paradigm is noted for constant security breaches and a perceived impossibility to protect even our most important systems from intrusion. Privacy is a non-feature and is abused at w",
