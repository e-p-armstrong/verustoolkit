    "Next to publishing the monthly recap on Medium, I will send the exact same content through a newsletter. Subscribe here. I\u2019ll try to keep things short and to the point. So let\u2019s get started with the very first monthly recap.\nAugust 2021\nPreparing Testnet for Ethereum Bridge\nThe multi-chain testnet has been reset. This in preperation for the bridge to the Rinkeby testnet. It has been said we are very close to this game-changing release.\nWallet Updates\nHighly recommended non-mandatory Verus Desktop and CLI wallet updates have been made available. (Critical for notaries and pools). Download v0.7.4 here\nConversations with Mike & Bluesky\nBluesky is an initiative from Twitter to create a decentralized social media platform. Verus lead developer Mike Toutonghi had some very interesting posts in their Discord channel explaining the benefits that Verus and VerusID can bring to their project. Everyone in their Discord is still shell-shocked from the bombs that Mike dropped on them. Read a part of the messages here. Verus has been selected to start a workgroup to integrate with OpenID. The future will tell if it is something worthwhile. One big positive is that more people, and especially developers, will learn about Verus. You can read all the messages back in the Bluesky Discord, and please keep the shilling to yourself. We want to foster professional and productive environments.Giant Website Overhaul\nWe are close to finishing a giant website overhaul. Better, more concise messaging. Easier to understand copywriting. More illustrations. Clearer design. All-in-all easier to digest for all people. I personally can\u2019t wait for it to be online. I believe it to be a great improvement that will definitely get more people more interested in Verus.",
