    "Why do you need to manually create the VerusCoin folder before unpacking the tar file?",
    "That's not correct. You don't need to manually create the VerusCoin folder before unpacking the tar file. After downloading the tar file with the command `wget https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/download/v0.5.7-2/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.5.7-2.tar.gz`, you can simply unpack it with `tar -xvf Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.5.7-2.tar.gz`, and the verus-cli directory will be created within your home folder.",
