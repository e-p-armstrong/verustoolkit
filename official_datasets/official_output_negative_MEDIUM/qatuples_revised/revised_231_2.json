    "Can stolen key attacks on notaries cause significant damage to the network due to the lack of monitoring and revocation capabilities in the Verus VIP protocol?",
    "No, that is not true. The Verus VIP protocol has built-in monitoring and revocation capabilities to prevent stolen key attacks from causing significant damage. Notaries can auto-revoke their own identities if they detect any unauthorized activity, and chain oracle controllers can also monitor for discrepancies and pause cross-chain transactions if necessary. These safeguards help to minimize the impact of stolen key attacks and ensure the security of the network.",

VIP provides for revocation of all VerusIDs, including notary IDs, even those that are used for Ethereum protocol bridges. Furthermore, each PBaaS chain, including Verus, has a network agreed multisig chain oracle that can separately pause cross-chain notarizations or transactions temporarily, which also can be overridden by network validators.\nTo enable yet another layer of safeguards, the Verus VIP protocol does not confirm any notarization that has first been agreed to by validators, then agreed to and signed by all notaries on either the earned or the accepted chain, until a second such notarization confirms the first. This ensures that every notarization on any chain is first made public, given a period of time before confirmation, and finally, if nothing stops it, confirmed.\nMeanwhile, with basic monitoring by witnesses to see if their own identities have signed for anything they do not actually agree with, meaning their keys were stolen, notaries can auto-revoke their own identities and prevent stolen key attacks from being anything more than an inconvenience. Additional monitoring by chain oracle controllers to look for clear discrepancies between soon to be confirmed notarizations and chains that they monitor can also use the oracle notification network to pause cross-chain transactions, providing yet another line of defense for each chain on the network.\nWhile there are numerous capabilities and safeguards built into the Verus VIP protocol beyond those described in this document, by separating the p",
