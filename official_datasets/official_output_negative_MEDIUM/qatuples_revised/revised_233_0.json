    "How do I control who mines my project within the Verus ecosystem?",
    "Within the Verus ecosystem, miners are encouraged to participate in mining projects that are interesting and profitable. You can even motivate them further by adding some $VRSC to the project. This implies that miners are free to participate in mining your project, rather than needing permission to do so.",
    ", if any, you want to receive yourself.\nDo you want to get a pre-mine? No problem. Choose your amount. It\u2019s only one out of many properties you can specify. Of course, this is all prepared before your Kickstarter-launch.\nIs your project interesting? Then miners within the Verus ecosystem will pick it up for you to maximize their profits. They can mine up to 22 chains simultaneously so it\u2019s a no-brainer. Maybe miners need a little extra motivation? Add some $VRSC to sweeten the pot. Boom, you have a chain running that is decentralized and protected against 51% attacks.\nThis is just a tiny amount of detail into how the whole system works, and all the specifications that can be customized. But for me, these are the most interesting. It all works together in harmony to create comfort, safety and ease of use for entrepreneurs and investors alike. These are the systems of the future. They will bring unique ideas, inspiring people, and new markets together. Exciting times are coming.",
