    "How do I set the preconversion time frame to less than 20 blocks when defining a currency?",
    "You cannot set the preconversion time frame to less than 20 blocks. The preconversion time frame is always 20 blocks and cannot be less.",
    " BusinessBrand and DiscountBrand.\n\u201cstartblock\u201d\nUse this parameter to define the block height when the currency is launched. There is a preconversion time frame before the currency is launched. When omitting this parameter it uses a 20 block preconversion time frame before the currency is launched.\nThe preconversion time frame is always 20 blocks, this can not be less.\n\u201cendblock\u201d\nEndblock can not be defined on basket currencies. It does nothing. It could be set as a signal to software that might use the basket currency.\nIt can be set on centralized (proofprotcol:2) simple token currencies. When the endblock is reached, it turns the centralized currency into a decentralized one.\n\u201cidregistrationfees\u201d\nUse this parameter to change the costs of registering subIDs under the rootID. The default registration fee is 100.\nWhen it\u2019s a decentralized currency the fees are burned, when it\u2019s centralized the fees go to the rootID.\nTo enable discounts when using referrals, add \"options\":8 to the currency definition.\n\u201cidreferrallevels\u201d\nUse this parameter to change the levels of referrals used when registering subIDs. The default is 3 levels.\n\u201cnativecurrencyid\u201d\nUse this parameter for mapped ERC-20 tokens. The parameter includes the Ethereum contract address for the ERC-20. Read here for more information.\nThese were all the parameters to use when defining currencies. There are many, and combining them in the right ways make powerful currencies and tokens. The community is always ready to help when defining and launching currencies for your use cases! Please go to Discord and ask away.\nThe next chapter explains how to exactly launch these currencies.\nHow to Launch the Currencies\nLaunching these currencies is quite easy. Launch with the command-line interface, or Verus Desktop for Windows, Linux or macOS. Download here.\nIn the chapter before many examples of currency definitions are given. ",
