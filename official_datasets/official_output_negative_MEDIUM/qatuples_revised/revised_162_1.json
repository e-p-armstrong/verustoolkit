    "Is Verus a centralized cryptocurrency project that had a premine?",
    "No, Verus is a truly decentralized, community-driven cryptocurrency project. It had a fair launch without a premine, and the team working on it is dedicated to a vision of a better future.",
    "e cases. For example, they\u2019re already a significant improvement in terms of cost and efficiency for cryptographic signing \u2014 which may seem like a small use case but it\u2019s not. Verus doesn\u2019t focus on it much but that one use case could, in itself, justify a mega blockchain project.\nBut Verus also isn\u2019t done yet \u2014 not at all, not nearly. When you add IDs to what\u2019s currently visible on testnet, the implications are mind-blowing again. A future, decentralized vision of the Internet \u2014 a future Internet of blockchains \u2014 requires a micro payment system to account for costs. Such a system requires identification for all actors \u2014 humans, software microservices, hardware resources \u2014 everything. The VerusID + the financial technologies that are being developed right now (a suite of equally innovative DeFi capabilities that deserve their own series of articles) are the basic building blocks for all of that.\nIt makes sense that people want to see innovations at the late adopter/grandparent level right now. Though it\u2019s changing rapidly, at this moment, in the whole blockchain space that level is only being addressed by a small handful of services, for example, many projects are making cryptocurrencies useful for financial services. Verus will contribute there as well, but from what I\u2019ve seen the long-term vision is even larger, and the pieces required to realized that vision are in the process of being built.\n**\n\u00b7 This article has more detail about how Verus feature sets such as its DeFi capabilities and VerusID will work and complement each other.\n\u00b7 There\u2019s a Verus channel with a lot more information on specific features.\n\u00b7 The Verus website is a fantastic resource.\n\u00b7 Join the conversation on Discord!\nVerus is a truly decentralized, *community* driven cryptocurrency project.
