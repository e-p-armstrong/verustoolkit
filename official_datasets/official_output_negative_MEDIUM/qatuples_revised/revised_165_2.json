    "Can PBaaS chain coins be staked on the Verus network?",
    "No, PBaaS chain coins cannot be staked on the Verus network. They are mineable and/or stakeable on their own chain, but not on the Verus network.",
    " this period.\nFor this reason, if you\u2019re staking a large balance you\u2019ll likely have better staking performance by making sure your balance is split up between multiple UTXOs \u2014 by having sent it to the wallet in multiple transactions rather than a single large transaction or otherwise redistributing it within the wallet. This keeps a larger portion of your funds available for staking while the successful stakes have to wait 150 blocks to be available for staking again. There are quickly diminishing returns here though, and having too many small transactions can decrease your wallet\u2019s efficiency in scanning all of them for eligible stakes. My recommendation is to not bother breaking up any UTXOs smaller than 5,000 VRSC.\nThe odds of each individual UTXO staking are independent, and proportional to their value. This means that one 10,000VRSC UTXO has the same odds of staking as a group of ten 1,000VRSC UTXOs.\nVerus Vault\nVerus Vault will soon move from Testnet to the main Verus network. Verus Vault allows a VerusID to be locked and prevented from spending until it is unlocked and a specified cooldown time has passed or a specific block height is reached, or until the ID is revoked and recovered. Verus Vault allows the funds in a locked ID to stake, so users protecting their funds this way won\u2019t miss out on staking opportunities.\nCurrencies and PBaaS\nAlso on the Verus Testnet right now is functionality for creating and trading using currencies. I recommend starting with this article on Verus DeFi to understand more. It is mentioned here to make it clear that currencies on Verus will not be able to stake; only Verus can stake. Also, Verus that resides in the reserves (the liquidity pool) of a fractional currency is unable to stake.\nPBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) chains have their own coin, which is mineable and/or stakeable on that chain, but not on the Verus netwo",
