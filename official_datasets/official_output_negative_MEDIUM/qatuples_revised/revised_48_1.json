    "Is the Verus network limited in its scalability and ability to support a large number of user identities and applications?",
    "No, the Verus network is designed to be highly scalable and can support an unlimited number of user identities and applications. It uses a 100% fully decentralized, unlimited scale backbone, secured by the Verus Proof of Power (PoP) consensus, which is 51% hash attack resistant. This allows for fast access to an unlimited number of user identities and their unlimited Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF) indexable key-value database.",
    "p-Development Opportunities at Consensus 2024\nGet ready for a new era of decentralized application development. Unlike today\u2019s complex smart contract applications, requiring VM-based smart contracts that talk to user facing applications through server-side APIs and phishing-prone web-interfaces using public key hashes or rented names as identity, the Verus network is a Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 0 (L0) protocol with composable and powerful multi-chain core primitives, including identities, currencies, MEV-resistant liquidity baskets, updateable, even transferable ID-bound databases that can comprise NFTs and real world assets, all on a 100% fully decentralized, unlimited scale backbone, secured by the 50% proof-of-stake / 50% proof-of-work, 51% hash attack resistant Verus Proof of Power (PoP) consensus and accessible securely from mobile clients or cloud-based web-applications.\nBuild applications in your favorite framework for clients and access the Verus network either through QR-codes and deep-links to a client-side wallet under user control or talk directly to data-indexed, blockchain nodes, capable of providing fast access to an unlimited number of user identities and their unlimited Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF) indexable key-value database providing provable, optionally private, worldwide resolvable data at unlimited scale over an unlimited number of blockchains. All of this power, including inherent eCommerce and markets of all types are usable by applications, and unlike yesterday\u2019s Internet, application-owned data stays under application control, while user-owned data remains under user control and subject to voluntary, provable disclosure, protected by zero knowledge privacy, as it should always have been.\nWrite applications your way, your client frameworks, your languages, with links and RPC calls to the decentralized Internet of Value. Connect through one ",
