    "Can you explain why VerusID can only store Verus network native assets?",
    "VerusID can actually store any asset on the Verus network, including those bridged from other blockchains.

If you have set up revocation and recovery authorities, you now have one week to safeguard your funds away from prying hands, back into your control.\nTrusts: setting up a trust fund for your children. Give your child a time locked VerusID with funds on them. When he or she turns 18, the VerusID unlocks and the funds can be spent. Keep revocation and recovery authorities with yourself or a trustee.\nVesting period: when doing a currency or chain launch, development funds can be diverted to a locked VerusID.

You can also spread the funds across multiple identities with different unlock periods.\nThese are just a few examples on how the powerful Verus Vault can be used.

When PBaaS is on mainnet, the first bridged asset is Ethereum.\n\u23f0 VerusID (NFT) Marketplace and Verus Vault activate on block 1,796,400 (expected on Monday, 29 November 2021).
