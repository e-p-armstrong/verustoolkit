    "What happens to the fees collected from transactions and ID registrations?",
    "The fees collected from transactions and ID registrations go into a fee pool. This fee pool is then distributed among miners and stakers, who each receive 1% of the fee pool along with their block reward. This distribution system helps to stabilize mining and staking proceeds over time and aligns incentives to prevent malicious behavior.",
    "rk directly.\nFees and the Fee Pool\nIn addition to the block reward miners and stakers are rewarded with the fees users pay to have their transactions processed by the network.\nAnother Testnet feature that will soon migrate to the main Verus network is the fee pool. The fees that go to the miners and stakers (such as transaction fees, ID registration costs, and others) will go into the fee pool, and each miner or staker will get to take 1% of what is in the fee pool along with their block reward. This makes mining/staking proceeds from fees more stable over time, rather than having occasional blocks with high fees from high-fee events like ID registrations. It also helps align incentives by making sure no potentially malicious miner or staker might want to mine for a previous block if the fees were particularly lucrative, since those fees are averaged out over time.\nTroubleshooting\nIf you believe you\u2019re having problems with staking here are a few things to check:\nCheck your eligible staking balance. Funds in a private address (z-address) aren\u2019t eligible to stake. Also any funds received, transacted with, or staked within the last 150 blocks aren\u2019t eligible. So keep these in mind when assessing your eligible balance. If there\u2019s a discrepancy between your wallet balance and your eligible staking balance not explained by these considerations, there might be something to investigate with the help of the community-support or staking channels on the Verus Discord.\nCheck to ensure that staking is enabled. If you\u2019re using the command line wallet or if you want to look under the hood on the Verus Desktop wallet use the getmininginfo command to see that staking is enabled (\u201cstaking\u201d:true) (on the CLI: verus getmininginfo ; in the GUI wallet: Settings->Coin Settings, then run getmininginfo in the command window).\nCheck your system clock to make sure your time is accurate.\nCheck i",
