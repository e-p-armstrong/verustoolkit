    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\
    \ M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\nAdversarial Question (based on text):\n\"\"\"\n\
    Why are VerusIDs not quantum-resistant?\n\"\"\"\n\nSupposed answer to the question\
    \ (this is what you are fact-checking; it should correct the question): \n\"\"\
    \"\nVerusIDs are actually already quantum-resistant \u2014 they are quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto addresses. The phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\"\
    \ refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers that\
    \ use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure signature scheme\
    \ for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have all the funds\
    \ sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant.\n\nSo with regard to your\
    \ question, it seems there's some confusion, as VerusIDs are, in fact, quantum-resistant.\n\

    \ Wallet to Latest Version\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-to-update-veruscoin-graphical-gui-wallet-to-0-4-0a-for-linux-686fc7a5b6e7\n\
    Content:How to Update VerusCoin Graphical (GUI) Wallet to Latest Version\nStep-by-step\
    \ for updating to the latest version of Verus GUI wallet on Ubuntu Linux and WindowsIn\
    \ this post I\u2019ll walk through the steps to updating to the latest Verus (GUI)\
    \ from a previous release. These steps may also be used for performing a fresh\
    \ install of the latest Verus wallet, including installing the wallet in tandem\
    \ on a system which already has Agama by Komodo installed.\nVerus wallet is an\
    \ modified and enhanced build of Agama. Verus includes enhancements such as mining,\
    \ staking, and latest zero knowledge Sapling features built in. Because Verus\
    \ wallet is a build of Agama, relying on the same daemon (komodod) in the background,\
    \ installing it side by side, on a system already containing Agama by Komodo does\
    \ take a little finesse to ensure both wallets work correctly, when all is said\
    \ and done.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\nAll nodes, CLI or GUI, must be v0.5.3 or later\
    \ (0.5.1 on Mac) unless otherwise announced on the official Verus Discord or Medium.\
    \ Please update your wallet immediately if you are running an older version.\n\
    Download binary for your OS: \nhttps://veruscoin.io/#download\nFor ALL step-by-steps\
    \ below, be sure to shutdown Agama and/or Verus wallet and backup your wallet.dat\
    \ files for ALL coins you have activated. In Step 1 of each section below I\u2019\
    ll walk you through the process of creating a backup of your entire hidden komodo\
    \ folder, which includes your wallet files, just for good measure.\nGraphical\
    \ Wallet (GUI) \u2014 Linux and Windows\nIn Linux it\u2019s easiest to do much\

    \ on text):\n\"\"\"\nCan I update my VerusCoin Graphical (GUI) Wallet to the latest\

    \"\"\"\n\nSupposed answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking):\n\
    \"\"\"\nNo, you must shutdown Agama and/or Verus wallet and backup your wallet.dat\
    \ files for ALL coins you have activated before updating your VerusCoin Graphical\
    \ (GUI) Wallet to the latest version. This is an important step to ensure the\
    \ safety of your coins and to prevent any potential losses.\n\"\"\""
