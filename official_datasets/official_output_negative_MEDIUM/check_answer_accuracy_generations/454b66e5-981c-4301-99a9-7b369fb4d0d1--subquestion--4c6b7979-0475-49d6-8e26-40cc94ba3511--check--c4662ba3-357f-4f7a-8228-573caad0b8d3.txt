    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\
    \ M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\nAdversarial Question (based on text):\n\"\"\"\n\
    Why are VerusIDs not quantum-resistant?\n\"\"\"\n\nSupposed answer to the question\
    \ (this is what you are fact-checking; it should correct the question): \n\"\"\
    \"\nVerusIDs are actually already quantum-resistant \u2014 they are quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto addresses. The phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\"\
    \ refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers that\
    \ use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure signature scheme\
    \ for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have all the funds\
    \ sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant.\n\nSo with regard to your\
    \ question, it seems there's some confusion, as VerusIDs are, in fact, quantum-resistant.\n\

    **Dissect the Answer's Assertions:**\n  * That VerusIDs are already quantum-resistant.\n\
    \  * That \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\" refers to the resistance\
    \ of VerusIDs against quantum attack with existing algorithms.\n  * That a quantum-secure\

    \ potential to break cryptographic algorithms.\n  * That being \"quantum-ready\"\

    \ Accuracy and Common Knowledge Check:**\n\n  * The text describes VerusIDs as\

    \ as referring to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers\

    \ text describes quantum-secure signature schemes as allowing funds to be made\
    \ retroactively quantum-resistant.\n  * The text does not mention anything about\
    \ quantum computers having the potential to break cryptographic algorithms, but\
    \ this is common knowledge.\n  * The text does not mention what \"quantum-ready\"\
    \ means explicitly, but this is easily-inferrable from the text and the words\
    \ themselves.\n  * The text explicitly describes how VerusIDs are capable of publishing\
    \ ID to destination mappings on other blockchains.\n  * The question asserts that\
    \ VerusIDs are not quantum-resistant, which is flawed.\n\n### Final Judgment:\n\

    \ and receive funds. With Verus, however, you can also create a VerusID and use\
    \ it to send and receive funds. This article is laser focused on features of the\
    \ VerusID that you can use to protect your funds but VerusIDs are incredibly powerful\
    \ and can be used as fully self sovereign identities.\nLike an email or web address,\
    \ VerusIDs can include any combination of letters and numbers. They just have\
    \ to end with an \u2018@\u2019 symbol. This document uses example addresses such\
    \ as, Bob@, and Alice@\u2014 but Mogg@ could also be a VerusID, or BigCompany@,\
    \ or BurgundySocksfortheHolidays@, or whatever.\nVerusIDs are controlled by one\
    \ or more associated addresses. For example, if you send funds to an ID, they\u2019\
    ll be available to be spent by that ID and also by associated addresses. As we\u2019\
    ll see, this opens up a lot of design space.\nThe Three Authorities\nEach VerusID\
    \ is created with three authorities. You can think of an authority as a bundle\
    \ of specific powers.\nFirst is primary authority. Primary authority allows an\
    \ ID to:\nreceive deposits,\nspend funds,\nsign,\nstake,\nmodify ID information,\n\
    lock, and\nunlock.\n(We\u2019ll look more closely at those last two \u2014 lock\
    \ and unlock \u2014 in a bit.)\nSecond is the revocation authority, typically\
    \ assigned to another ID. The revocation authority revokes the primary authority.\
    \ When used, it prevents an ID from spending or receiving funds, staking, signing,\
    \ etc. For example, say you have two IDs, \u201CBob@\u201D and \u201CAlice@.\u201D\
    \ If you assign Bob@\u2019s revocation authority to Alice@:\nAlice@ will be able\
    \ to revoke Bob@\u2019s primary authority, making Bob@ unable to spend or receive\
    \ funds, etc.\nOnly Alice@ will be able to change the revocation authority for\
    \ Bob@; Bob@ will not be able to change it.\nFinally, there\u2019s the recovery\
    \ authority. After it\u2019s assigned to an ID, the recovery authority can be\
    \ used to recover a revoked primary a\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text):\n\"\
