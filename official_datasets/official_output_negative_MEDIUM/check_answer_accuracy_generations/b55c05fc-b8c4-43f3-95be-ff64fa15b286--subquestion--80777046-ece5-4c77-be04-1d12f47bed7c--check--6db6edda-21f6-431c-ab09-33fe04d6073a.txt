    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\
    \ M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\nAdversarial Question (based on text):\n\"\"\"\n\

    \"\nVerusIDs are actually already quantum-resistant \u2014 they are quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto addresses. The phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\"\

    The Fee Pool is introduced as a security measure to keep the protocol stable.\
    \ We have seen in other blockchain protocols that when a block has large fees,\
    \ block producers try to \u201Csnipe\u201D the block (putting lots of hash onto\
    \ the network, then pulling it out of the network, or even trying to reorder the\
    \ blocks for their own gain). In doing so they destabilize the protocol. Verus\
    \ mitigates this behavior by spreading the extra fees over many blocks.\nSmart\
    \ Contracts Are Not Secure\nMost blockchain protocols use the VM-based application\
    \ model \u2014 smart contracts written with Solidity. It\u2019s full of smart\
    \ contract hacks and bugs and has insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval\
    \ mechanisms. On top of that MEV (maximum extractable value) is rampant, due to\
    \ the serial processing of transactions on the VM-model (it\u2019s easy for a\
    \ block producer to reorder transactions inside a block for their own gain). We\
    \ can honestly say that the VM-model is not secure.\nThe Verus approach is different\
    \ as it follows the fundamental systems design principle \u2014 the most important\
    \ security layers should be located in the protocol itself, and not coded on top\
    \ via L2 (smart contracts). All operations on Verus and PBaaS-chains are directly\
    \ connected to consensus, secured by the miners and stakers of the protocol.\n\
    Now you might ask yourself \u201CBut can we build dApps that are as capable as\
    \ building them with the VM-model?\u201D. The answer is yes. Developing dApps\
    \ with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application\
    \ model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions.\n\
