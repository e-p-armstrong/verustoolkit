    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\
    \ M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\nAdversarial Question (based on text):\n\"\"\"\n\
    Why are VerusIDs not quantum-resistant?\n\"\"\"\n\nSupposed answer to the question\
    \ (this is what you are fact-checking; it should correct the question): \n\"\"\
    \"\nVerusIDs are actually already quantum-resistant \u2014 they are quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto addresses. The phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\"\
    \ refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers that\

    Content:vBasics: Verus DeFi\nVerus is a UTXO-based cryptocurrency with DeFi in\
    \ its consensus protocol. In this first vBasics-series, we explain what liquidity\
    \ pools, automated market makers and fractional currencies are, and how they function\
    \ in the Verus ecosystem.Verus is a foundational blockchain that builds key primitives\
    \ at the consensus level of the protocol. DeFi is one of those key primitives,\
    \ and quite difficult to wrap our heads around. Especially as the words we use\
    \ can be confusing. This is new technology so we make it up as we go. DeFi systems\
    \ we know use words like \u2018automated market makers\u2019 and \u2018liquidity\
    \ pools\u2019. Verus adds \u2018fractional currency\u2019 to the terminology.\n\
    In a DeFi system there are no people you buy or sell your currency to. You only\
    \ interact with a pool of liquidity. Inside this pool of liquidity can be many\
    \ different currencies, small or large amounts. The liquidity pool is attached\
    \ to a currency. The currency that is attached to the liquidity pool has a value\
    \ that is determined by what is in the liquidity pool (image 1).\nImportant note:\
    \ in the Verus ecosystem, all currencies with liquidity pools have adaptive supplies.\n\
    Image 1: In Verus DeFi a currency can have a pool of liquidity attached to it\n\
    Let\u2019s start by explaining currencies that are backed by 100% (see image 2).\
    \ In our example we have NewCurrency. This currency is backed by 100% and has\
    \ VRSC and ETH in its liquidity pool (A).\nIn a currency that is 100% backed,\
    \ the value is always equally divided by the number of currencies in the liquidity\
    \ pool. NewCurrency has 1000 VRSC and 2 ETH in its liquidity pool. And even though\
    \ they are different values, and they have different values outside the Verus\
    \ ecosystem, they still represent 50/50% of the value (B).\nLet\u2019s say the\
    \ currencies in the liqu\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text):\n\"\"\"\nCan the\
    \ value of a currency in the Verus DeFi system be influenced by external market\
    \ forces?\n\"\"\"\n\nSupposed answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking):\n\
    \"\"\"\nNo, the value of a currency in the Verus DeFi system is determined solely\
    \ by the contents of its associated liquidity pool, and not by external market\
    \ forces. The article explains that the value of a currency is divided equally\
