{"text": "Title: Verus Internet Protocol (VIP)\u200a\u2014\u200aProvable, Decentralized Cross-chain Communication\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-internet-protocol-vip-provable-decentralized-cross-chain-communication-8d9414a429c5\nContent:\n\nVerus Internet Protocol (VIP) \u2014 Provable, Decentralized Cross-chain Communication\nWritten by Mike Toutonghi, lead developer of the Verus Protocol.\n\nHow it started\nBitcoin proved that decentralized, secure, permissionless and provable agreement on a worldwide blockchain network of participants is possible.\nHow it\u2019s going\nBeyond Bitcoin, most leading blockchain networks today were initially centralized through ICOs or large pre-mines, rather than a fairly launched protocol. In some cases, the ICO or pre-mined share of ownership was further entrenched by switching from proof of work, as a way for anyone to earn, to pure proof of stake, where owning the network currency is required to earn and those with the most earn the most. As part of prioritizing early growth to capture maximum crypto market share, these platforms generally abdicated the hard work of designing or implementing core protocol primitives, such as currencies or identities, beyond one native currency, as originally conceived in Bitcoin.\nInstead, the popular VM model of many blockchains today, which generally provide a shared \u201ccomputer\u201d or VM on top of a decentralized blockchain, leaves building critical primitives as someone else\u2019s problem, usually companies and app designers, basically writing centralized apps. Instead of a secure set of underlying rules for currencies, we get best practices and the evolutionary legacy of thousands of \u201cdApps\u201d, which ironically, are mostly just partial or full re-implementations of the secure primitives missing in the consensus-based L1 protocols themselves.\nAs a result of the focus on pumping and market capture vs. evolving what we could learn from Bitcoin with sustainable, decentralized, more secure primitives and better protocol design, billions of dollars of value has been lost or transferred from naive early users who bought into the pumped crypto hype to hackers, scammers, VCs, centralized exits, and MEV-exploiters who all leveraged the mass of weaknesses they either failed to protect against or in some cases created and obscured themselves on systems that don\u2019t define or enforce even the most common core primitives, currencies or identities. A great deal of loss has been due to obviously poor cross-chain \u201cbridge\u201d design, with the most common problem being bugs in complex smart contract workflow, followed by stolen or compromised private keys of contract owners / controllers, and in some cases, outright theft by contract controllers.\nThe lack of agreement on basic primitives and how to represent them in a globally resolvable way has held back general, robust solutions to the fundamental problem of interoperability between blockchains and other financial networks today. To complicate our collective challenges, adding full primitive support in the protocols is hard work, especially in an industry where just a year of development is considered a massive investment that must be rewarded by timely exit liquidity. Consequently, an abundance of shortcuts and heavily marketed yet hastily built solutions still dominate the popular narrative, as hacks, rugpulls, and losses continue to pile up.\nThe solution\nVerus was founded by technology veterans and others who believe humanity can do better than being exploited by the technology these same veterans had been building for corporations over decades. The Verus PBaaS protocol was designed, built, and tested over more than 5 years by a self-selected and often volunteer group of technology, finance, legal, operations, or just life veterans and newbies alike. Early Verusians shared a common vision and made it reality, achieving a fairly launched, community driven project without VCs or ICO participants who may want to exit and a truly decentralized unlimited scale network that all humanity can use and build upon without paying rent to anyone.\nIt has taken exactly as long as it has to realize the vision laid out 5 years ago, which is more clearly relevant today than ever. Along the way, that vision has grown and evolved as new community members contributed their own vision to help us improve, making the Verus PBaaS protocol, of which VIP is a small part, a major milestone for the crypto industry and a move back to the original intent of decentralized networks that was pioneered, if not fully realized by Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin. Verus has taken Nakamoto consensus to the next level with consensus driven functional protocols for network primitives that are needed in any network hoping to securely enable financial applications.\nTo ensure maximum decentralization, the Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) takes a maximally decentralized, validator driven approach to its multi-network bridging by incorporating and accounting for currencies, identities, namespaces, and the concept of connected networks themselves in the L0 and L1 consensus protocols. The Verus Internet Protocol provides just enough structure to interoperate with any system that can control funds based on logic and exposes a provable representation of currencies and/or identities.\nBy grounding interoperability in a cryptographically provable, hierarchical namespace of self-sovereign, worldwide resolvable identities, VIP enables the first high-throughput, unlimited scale, decentralized, multi-protocol, non-custodial, auditable and transparent, currency and identity aware cross-blockchain communications protocol.\nA cross-chain protocol with same chain properties\nVIP can be seen as a cross-chain protocol that operates on proof of proof of consensus (PoPoC). VIP has the following properties:\nTransactions that include cross-chain operations, cross-system currency transfers, or new currency and identity definitions, are standardized in the protocol, as are the semantics of their cross-chain use, fee models, cross-system, name-centric provable routing, and MEV-resistant bundling and rollup properties. These characteristics can be and have been implemented on UTXO, VM-based, and transparently centralized networks.\nVIP supports direct or indirect system<->system communication, including cross-system export and import of currency and identity definitions, as well as revocation, recovery, and controlling keys. All cross-chain or DeFi functions in the protocol are accessible to full or lite node clients and applications by simply creating standard transaction inputs and outputs that specify the operations. Available APIs on every node or FOSS API server simplify the creation of transactions with cross-chain outputs in response to command requests or JSON RPC calls.\nTransactions with Identity, DeFi, or cross-chain operations, including all inputs and outputs, even exports and imports of all currencies, are checked for validity by miners and stakers with network consensus, just as single currency inputs and outputs are in today\u2019s single currency blockchain networks.\nCross-chain protocols operate in the same way as on-chain DeFi protocols and are processed on chain by miners and stakers with a bundle->export->import workflow, enabling high-throughput DeFi and cross-chain operations.\nIn PBaaS, exports, imports, and DeFi operations are all solved simultaneously and processed with at per-block or larger granularity in an MEV-resistant manner as part of the core protocol, recognizing and enabling the need for beneficial arbitrage, while eliminating toxic MEV such as front-running and sandwiching once and for all.\nAll cross-chain operations are proven based on one of the following proof models, which are configurable on a per system/chain basis:\nDecentralized consensus-achieved, witness enhanced, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (auto-notarization)\nDecentralized consensus-achieved, witness-dependent, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (notary dependent notarization)\nSemi-centralized or centrally controlled gateway proofs\nFull auto-notarization is only available between Verus and PBaaS chains, and operates faster with but is not dependent on notary witnesses. When auto-notarization is applied to other gateway connections, the protocol will fall back to the closest it can come between auto-notarization and notary dependent, which may evolve towards less dependence on the notaries in future versions. Whether you auto-notarize or depend on notary witness confirmation, all forms of notarization operate similarly. We\u2019ll start with the basic workflow, then highlight differences:\n\u201cEarned\u201d and \u201cAccepted\u201d notarizations \u2014 VIP broadly defines two types of cross-system notarizations, earned and accepted.\nGenerally, one side of a connection will create \u201cearned\u201d notarizations, which on PBaaS chains or for the Ethereum bridge, are created by miners and stakers adding a notarization output to the coinbase. Earned notarizations, which can only be created by Verus or PBaaS chain miners and stakers, include a way to agree or disagree with specific past notarizations, and are subject to further \u201cconfirmation\u201d rules, which may vary depending on if the rules are \u201cauto\u201d, centralized, or \u201cnotary confirm\u201d.\nOnce a new, earned notarization is confirmed, the proof of confirmation is sent to the \u201cnotary\u201d system, which is typically a launch chain, and in the case of the ETH bridge, is Ethereum, along with any notary signatures necessary to prove confirmation, which are typically present. The new, confirmed, earned notarization is entered on the notary chain as an \u201caccepted\u201d notarization, and is entered as \u201cagreeing\u201d with a prior accepted notarization along with proof of the agreement. If the prior accepted notarization it agrees with is not yet confirmed, then it may be considered newly confirmed.\n2. Once an earned notarization has been agreed to by a new earned notarization, alternating between PoW and PoS blocks to help further decentralized requirements for agreement, and by following all notarization rules, notary witnesses may sign signifying they agree with the notarization as well. Although they can disagree with a signature, no signature is also a valid way to disagree.\n3. After validators and notary witnesses have agreed, or in the case of auto-notarization, a longer validation period with more agreement has passed, the prior notarization agreed with by a new notarization that has passed all necessary agreement, is confirmed. Once that happens, the blockchain is considered final up to the point of that confirmation and will resist reorganizations to any point behind.\nThe primary difference between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization is the amount and type of evidence required to enter a potentially confirmed notarization. Most notably, \u201cnotary confirm\u201d always requires a quorum of signatures from the specified notaries, whereas auto-notarization requires more multi-stage evidence in the face of randomized proof selection, potential fraud proofs and disagreements. Fully centralized gateways still operate on cryptographic proofs, but they only need notaries to agree on the cryptographic roots in order to consider them true and do not need cryptographic proof to establish the notarization proof root.\nOnce a proof root has been established by notarization, this root is used to cryptographically prove bundles of transactions exported from one chain or system and imported to another. Even Ethereum transactions are proven in both directions using the same workflow, although Ethereum transactions are validated using PATRICIA Trie proofs, while PBaaS chains use the Verus Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) method, both being cryptographically sound. Cross-chain bundles of transactions follow the same bundling protocol when sourced from Verus or PBaaS chains as is followed in DeFi to prevent MEV.\nTransactions are always delivered to the destination network with bundles in the order they were created on the source network and according to the enforceable rules of the source network. Since a relayer may add arbitrage transactions when the destination is a PBaaS chain, but may not affect the provable source contents of a relayed bundle from one network to another, no restriction is placed on who relays a valid bundle of transactions. Since validators who relay and mine or stake transaction bundles into a block may earn a validation fee from the import transaction itself, validators or notaries will generally shuttle transaction bundles between chains and networks out of self interest, while having no ability whatsoever to censor or modify protocol level bundles.\nWhat witness / notaries do NOT do\nWitnesses / notaries have no control over what transactions are or are not included or the order in which they arrive from one system to another, as all of that is dictated by the protocol. By default, notaries cannot create notarizations and can only witness the validity of notarizations already created and agreed to by both proof of work and proof of stake validators.\nWitness notaries\u2019 primary role is to agree or disagree with the network validators\u2019 earned notarizations, which are earned on one blockchain and accepted on another chain or system. As long as validators enter valid notarizations as part of the merge mining or staking process, confirm other notarizations entered by past validators, and a majority of notaries sign and witness their recognition of those events, a proof root that can be used by anyone to prove committed bundles of cross-chain transactions is established on both systems for the other. As the protocol ensures via cryptographic proof validation that the cross-chain bundles are the exact bundles in the order they were packaged on the source system, importing cross-chain transaction bundles is a permissionless operation that anyone, usually a validator, can perform, which relies on the proof established in relation to a confirmed, notarized proof root.\nDo auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options have different security considerations?\nYes. Proper planning and selection of options and witness ID structure during the launch of a blockchain network or gateway can ensure that security levels meet network demands. There are security tradeoffs between auto-notarization and notary-confirm options, which basically are a tradeoff between a permissionless model where proof root determination is enhanced, but not dependent upon multisig agreement of notary witnesses, auto-notarization vs. a model where establishing any cross-network cryptographic proof root requires the honest participation of a majority of the notary witnesses, which can be represented by revocable and recoverable IDs, allowing for further decentralization, even while requiring participation of a quorum.\nDetermining which option to choose, how many and what notaries to choose, what other safeguards can further enhance security, and then understanding the resulting security profile from each set of choices, is important when launching a blockchain or gateway. The following outlines the current high-level security considerations when configuring a new chain or gateway.\nCurrently, Verus VIP supports 2 proof models for interchain communication, the Verus PBaaS Merkle Mountain Range proofs, which also assume the Verus Proof of Power protocol, and Ethereum PATRICIA Trie proofs that enable interfacing with VIP between any PBaaS chain, and any Ethereum VM + PATRICIA Trie compatible network.\nSince Verus PBaaS is the only interface to fully support notarization finalization using full auto-notarization, it is important to understand the differences between PBaaS and Ethereum proof protocols. At present, there is no objective proof protocol implementation for Ethereum that is known and implemented, which can operate without dependence on some set of notary witnesses. At this time, auto-notarization, when applied to Ethereum, is more similar to notary-confirm, with additional revocation safeguards that could address more edge-case threat models.\nAs new proof algorithms evolve for Ethereum, enabling trustworthy cross-chain proof models in both directions that are both timely and do not need to be backed by witness signatures, it will be possible to update the protocols to remove dependence on witnesses over time. To ensure maximum decentralization on the Ethereum bridge, the network itself can permissionlessly propose contract upgrades, and if affirmatively voted on by Verus validators, an upgrade and new contracts can eventually change the cross-chain proof conditions.\nAuto-notarization of one PBaaS chain on another (PBAAS_AN) differs from and Ethereum interface or notary-confirm (NC) in that, if there are enough validated blocks, both mined and staked, as well as validator agreed notarizations, PBAAS_AN allows validators to finalize a notarization and submit it to the alternate chain. If there are disagreements about the correct notarization, the process becomes an on-chain proof competition, requiring each party to represent a growing, actual chain with both proof of work and proof of stake with an eventual winner. NC still has the miners and stakers create and earn from earned notarizations, but it also must have agreement from specified notaries to finalize any notarization and cannot finalize cross-chain proof roots without that agreement.\nImprovement over common cross-chain protocols\nSince Verus VIP does not ever have any identity, multisig or otherwise, hold custody over any funds when crossing from one decentralized network to another, even in the context of the Verus Ethereum contracts, threats caused by malicious notaries or stolen keys to drain funds on decentralized bridges or currencies are simply not viable against the Verus VIP protocol.\nCross-chain notarizations must first be entered by an earning validator, either PoW or PoS, and must also be agreed to by another validator, alternating between work and stake in eligibility. Only after that happens can notary witnesses apply their signature and agree to make that a confirmed notarization candidate. Still, what happens if a majority of notaries are malicious and colluding, or if some entity was able to somehow steal a majority of the notary private keys?\nIf the majority of notary witnesses are honest and operate their witnessing nodes according to the protocol, the security of such a model should be sufficient for any level of cross-chain transaction proof. If, however, a majority of the notaries were colluding and malicious or if their keys were stolen, Verus VIP still provides ways to ensure that the protocol responds to such a situation without risk of loss. Although there are ways to mitigate such a form of attack, even if no mitigation were available, such malicious or fraudulent notary witnesses would need the following in order to attack a PBaaS cross-chain connection:\nColluding, malicious notaries\nFake validators with more combined hash + stake power than the publicly validated chain making earned notarizations\nDevelopers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow chain\nWhile you may recognize these requirements as very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain, the Verus VIP protocol provides a way to even defend against such an unlikely scenario. VIP provides for revocation of all VerusIDs, including notary IDs, even those that are used for Ethereum protocol bridges. Furthermore, each PBaaS chain, including Verus, has a network agreed multisig chain oracle that can separately pause cross-chain notarizations or transactions temporarily, which also can be overridden by network validators.\nTo enable yet another layer of safeguards, the Verus VIP protocol does not confirm any notarization that has first been agreed to by validators, then agreed to and signed by all notaries on either the earned or the accepted chain, until a second such notarization confirms the first. This ensures that every notarization on any chain is first made public, given a period of time before confirmation, and finally, if nothing stops it, confirmed.\nMeanwhile, with basic monitoring by witnesses to see if their own identities have signed for anything they do not actually agree with, meaning their keys were stolen, notaries can auto-revoke their own identities and prevent stolen key attacks from being anything more than an inconvenience. Additional monitoring by chain oracle controllers to look for clear discrepancies between soon to be confirmed notarizations and chains that they monitor can also use the oracle notification network to pause cross-chain transactions, providing yet another line of defense for each chain on the network.\nWhile there are numerous capabilities and safeguards built into the Verus VIP protocol beyond those described in this document, by separating the proof root notarization process and using cryptographic proof as the foundation of a provable, high throughput, cross-chain export/import protocol, VIP enables the most secure, scalable, decentralized and multi-modal cross-chain protocol ever designed for blockchains and the Internet of Value.\nTry the Verus Protocol Yourself! \u2705\nLook up docs.verus.io to use many API commands (e.g. launching currencies, tokens & liquidity pools).\nOr look up the complete command list here.\nJoin the community.

It was a successful conference for the community, lots of fun, lots of heads turned, and lots of interest. Many community members attended, and for most of us it was the first time we all met in real life! It was an absolute pleasure and privilege meeting fellow community members and making friends along the way. The conference ignited a renewed sense of urgency for the continuation of the Verus mission. A public good for all of humanity, enabling novel ways for people to work together and create value. The future is bright. Thanks to everyone who donated that made this a possibility!\n\ud83d\udcd6 \u27a1\ufe0f Community member tango808 wrote a summary of all that was happening.

The world\u2019s most influential crypto & blockchain experience of the year. Here tens of thousands of crypto enthusiasts come together to discover the latest industry-leading developments.\n\nVerus Addresses Ethereum Network Challenges\nThe Verus protocol addresses challenges that are seen in Ethereum and other networks. Challenges such as MEV (Miner Extractable Value), scalability and cross-chain/network interoperability.\nWith the release of the new Verus testnet (March 6, 2022, see extensive release notes) and the planned mainnet launch before the start of Consensus 2022, Verus can be used as, among many other things, a launch platform for ERC-20 tokens and currencies.\nThrough the Verus Interchain Protocol (VIP, decentralized bridging technology) creators can use the Verus protocol to create currencies and tokens and immediately export them to Ethereum as ERC-20s without needing any Solidity developers or actual programming. Saving costs and having the ability to use the most feature-rich decentralized crypto protocol to date. Currencies and tokens on the Verus protocol can also be created to be mapped 1:1 with any ERC-20 token, making never seen before value transfers possible.\nAll currencies and tokens on the Verus and Ethereum networks can be used with Verus DeFi. Verus DeFi is part of the L1 consensus protocol, which means that all AMM conversions can not be front-run or reordered, and are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block, meaning all participants get the same price in all directions of conversion.\nAdditionally, anyone can create a blockchain with Verus PBaaS technology. Rent-free, independent and fully interoperable with all other connected blockchains in the network. See release notes for more extensive information on various launch options for currencies, tokens and blockchains.\nEthereum is the first network that has a decentralized bridge to Verus, and many networks will follow. The Verus community is excited to showcase these working technologies to the masses at Consensus 2022.\nPowerful Verus Community\nThe Verus community came together to make the attendance of Consensus 2022 possible and donated VRSC, BTC and ETH at an incredible combined amount of $150,000. Thank you so much to everyone who donated! \u2764\ufe0f\nWith the funds, the Verus community acquired a 10x10 feet (3x3 meter) booth at Consensus. And a hotel suite to be used as a Verus community home base and where interested parties can learn about Verus away from the noisy and busy Austin Convention Center.\nMost Verus community members are all joining Consensus 2022 and we want you to join as well! Let\u2019s make a big presence and let the world see what Verus has to offer. We are all hyped and confident it is going to be a great opportunity for Verus and its ecosystem!\nGrab your ticket here. \u26a0\ufe0f Get a 15% discount on your Consensus 2022 ticket if you join the Discord channel, and ask for the discount code in #marketing!\n\ud83d\udc99 Visit verus.io for more information on Verus\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: Is Verus Poised to Challenge Ethereum?\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/is-verus-poised-to-challenge-ethereum-7935ea559b28\nContent:\n\nIs Verus Poised to Challenge Ethereum?\nAfter this initial deep dive into the Verus Project\u2019s technology, you may agree that the Verus blockchain architecture, and use of smart transactions over smart contracts, are poised to position it as the strongest new force in emerging blockchain functionalities like DeFi and decentralized identities.\n\nOn May 21st, 2018, one lucky miner in the world somewhere mined the first VerusCoin to ever exist. Since then a vastly growing number of people have discovered the Verus Project. They are forming a lively and thriving community that has been participating in the network through mining and staking the coin, and are also contributing to its growth.\nVerus has come a long way since more than two years ago. We are proud to share our achievements with you. In this article, you will reach a better understanding of some of the technology that has been built and what makes Verus unique and, in our opinion, superior:\nFair Launch: No ICO, pre-mine or founder and developer fees.\nVerusHash 2.2: The hashing algorithm that was developed to lower mining barriers for everyone and create a naturally decentralized network.\nVerus Proof of Power (VerusPoP): 50% PoS, 50% PoW, a provable hybrid solution to 51% hash attacks.\nVerusID: Arguably the most advanced self-sovereign, decentralized identities; they are revocable and recoverable identities on the blockchain, packed with features and capabilities for everyone to use.\nPublic Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS): Launch your own blockchain with customizable specifications, while using Verus infrastructure for security and continuity. PBaaS provides a roadmap for practically unlimited scalability.\nMulti-Reserve Currencies: Just one part of the Verus token/currency functionality, multi-reserve currencies are the foundation for a user-centric DeFi.\nValue for Miners & Stakers: Verus architecture provides rewards to miners and stakers, an entire economy that leads to a robust, strong and permanent infrastructure.\n\nFair Launch: No ICO, Pre-Mine or Developer and Founder Fees\nAn announcement was made 15 minutes prior to the launch of the blockchain [see BitcoinTalk announcement]. From the very first beginnings of the VerusCoin blockchain anyone had a fair opportunity to start mining and then staking the coin. Verus is a community driven project in the true spirit of Bitcoin \u2014 no ICO, no pre-mine, no founder or developers fees.\nThe Verus Coin Foundation pushes development further to accomplish its vision for the future [see Verus Vision Paper]. Anyone who wants to contribute to the project, in any capacity, is welcome. Join our ever growing community on Discord to find out more about the Verus Project.\n\nVerusHash 2.2: Lowering Mining Barriers for Everyone\nVerusHash 2.2 is the mining algorithm for VerusCoin. The algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs, and to create a naturally decentralized miner ecosystem.\nNo specialized mining equipment is necessary to mine VerusCoin, and it can even be solo-mined directly from the Verus Desktop wallet with just a few clicks, without any additional software requirements. Beginners can find an even level playing field to start earning VRSC.\nStart mining now, get your VRSC mining software here, or start solo mining from within Verus Desktop.\n\nVerus Proof of Power (VerusPoP): A Provable Hybrid Solution to 51% Hash Attacks\nVerusCoin has a unique consensus mechanism: it is 50% Proof of Work and 50% Proof of Stake. This means that half of newly generated blocks come from mining (PoW), and the other half comes from staking (PoS). Verus\u2019 staking algorithm solves the two major theoretical issues undermining other PoS systems, \u201cnothing at stake\u201d and \u201cweak subjectivity\u201d by leveraging its smart transaction capabilities to remove any incentive to attempt cheating, making it a losing proposition.\nThis mechanism is called Proof of Power or VerusPoP and provides a further decentralizing effect on the network, incentivizing holders to keep nodes online to support the network. Even if a change in network hashrate happens, the PoW/PoS ratio stays the same: 50/50%.\nTo successfully attack the VerusCoin blockchain, more than 50% of the validation power is needed, called Chain Power. On top of that, VerusCoin utilizes Komodo\u2019s delayed Proof of Work. This means the chain is constantly being notarized into the Bitcoin blockchain on every bitcoin block, leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate to help defend the Verus network.\nIn over two years of mainnet, VerusCoin has never experienced a successful 51% hash attack. Learn more in the technical whitepaper of VerusPoP.\n\n\nVerusID: Self-Sovereign, Decentralized, Revocable and Recoverable Identities on the Blockchain\n\u201cSmart transactions\u201d also provide the foundation to create decentralized identities with revocation and recovery capabilities that we have not seen with any blockchain project, not even on their roadmaps. Anyone can create a VerusID with our easy to use multi-currency wallet, Verus Desktop, or through the Command Line (CLI) [find both here]. A creator of a VerusID pays a fee of 100 VRSC, or 80 VRSC when using a referral. These fees go 100% to miners and stakers. Here is a list of the most important features of VerusID:\nSelf-sovereign: you have complete ownership and control over your VerusID through the use of private keys. No one besides you has control over your VerusID unless you choose so. It is a permissionless system, so anyone in the world can create a VerusID.\nRevocable and recoverable: when creating a VerusID, you can specify a revoke ID and a recover ID. Verus believes that this functionality is critical for any system of self-sovereign identities; users need a path to recover their identities if their private keys are lost or stolen, otherwise there is just too much risk in a self-sovereign system where an identity can become inaccessible with a single mistake. It\u2019s now possible for the first time ever that you can recover from private key loss or theft in a completely decentralized, self-sovereign way.\nFriendly name: a VerusID is a blockchain address that can also hold funds, and stake its VRSC. This is an improved system for holding and receiving funds, as users now have a friendly, human-readable name, e.g. Verus Coin Foundation@, to receive, send and secure all their cryptocurrencies. It means, too, that funds held in a VerusID address are recoverable in the event of private key loss.\nMultisig: each VerusID can function as a multisig address, thus making it possible to be controlled by multiple people. In this way, new methods are provided for organizations or groups of people to work together.\nThere is more: with VerusID you also have z-addresses (Sapling) for private transactions and messages, and you can create unforgeable signatures for messages and for signing files. Furthermore you can transfer a VerusID to another address, including all of its UTXOs!\nEarn VRSC with Referrals\nVerusID has a referral system in which anyone can earn VRSC. Referrals go back 3 levels as part of the blockchain rules. An unreferred VerusID costs 100 VRSC, all of which goes to the miner or staker of the block that contains that VerusID registration.\nIf someone has a referral, their VerusID costs 80 VRSC, and 20 VRSC goes to the referrer. If the referrer has a referrer, they also get 20 VRSC. Up to 3 referrers get 20 VRSC each and the remaining 20\u201360 VRSC goes to the miner or staker of the block.\n\n\nPublic Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS): Launch Your Own Blockchain\nVerus sees a future where anyone can create their own blockchain in an easy fashion. Every blockchain in the ecosystem is independent and customizable. To create a chain one needs to have the VerusID name of the chain.\nChains can be nested to any level, so that a chain, say \u201cNewChain\u201d, that is launched with a VerusID on the main Verus blockchain, can be used to spawn an unlimited amount of new chains, each of these using identities on NewChain, which can be acquired at any cost as selected by the creator of NewChain.\nNew chains inherit the 50/50% PoW/PoS consensus mechanism. This percentage might be customizable in the future.\nA newly created chain can be mined by the miners of VerusCoin. A miner in the VerusCoin ecosystem can mine up to 22 different PBaaS-chains without losing any of the original hash power. This is called Merge-Mining and means that a creator of the chain doesn\u2019t have to worry about creating their own mining infrastructure.\nPBaaS chains will form the basis for a practically unlimited scalability of the Verus system. Popular currencies and tokens can exist and be interchangeable on many Verus blockchains, so that they won\u2019t be restricted or limited by the capacities of a single blockchain.\nA chain can have certain characteristics like launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund. Other options include dynamic coin launch pricing based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carve outs, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations. Additionally the creator can specify coin supply, coin emission with up to three era\u2019s and define the price for identities. All specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary.\n\nMulti-Reserve Currencies: DeFi Reimagined\nVerus is currently in testnet with its system of currencies and tokens which can be optionally backed by reserves. There are many other options for currency/token creation that we will cover in future articles.\nHere, we\u2019ll focus on multi-reserve currencies, which we believe offers a new reimagined paradigm for the world of decentralized finance. Specifically, these multi-reserve currencies allow the creation of liquidity pools (like Uniswap, Bancor or Balancer) with a better cost and risk structure for providers than that witnessed in Ethereum-based systems (where providers must deal with high gas costs and risks of faulty smart contracts).\nLiquidity providers can also benefit from volatility within a pool as the Verus system dynamically requires additional fees from conversions when the conversion ratios are volatile (in order to offset impermanent loss). A liquidity provider can earn good fees on a busy pool where the conversion ratios are consistently volatile, especially if the conversion ratios eventually return to ratios that prevailed at the time of the provider\u2019s point of entry.\nUsers also benefit, since the Verus system does away with front-running, latency wars and gas price wars. Verus is an UTXO-based blockchain, with smart transaction capabilities, allowing for the parallel processing/solving of all DeFi transactions submitted in a block. This offers significant advantages to the Ethereum VM, which is perfectly designed to perpetuate races and zero-sum games, where the most savvy well-financed players gain all the advantage against the everyday user.\nVerus has none of Ethereum\u2019s downsides for users, like high gas fees and front-running. All users interact with the system knowing that they will get the fair price for their transaction: the exact same price for all buys and sells submitted by all users within that block.\nMulti-reserve currencies are 100% backed by the currencies they contain in their liquidity pool. If they contain two currencies, the value is distributed 50/50%. If three currencies, 33/33/33%, and so on. Regardless of their price movement, this percentage always stays the same.\nA primary use-case for the multi-reserve currencies is the conversion from one currency to another, without the need of any counterparty. Since there is always liquidity inside a multi-reserve currency anyone can convert at any time. For example: a person has ETH and wants to convert to VRSC. He converts first to the multi-reserve currency ETH*VRSC with ETH (one transaction), now he can convert the ETH*VRSC to VRSC (another transaction). Of course, in order for this to operate, ETH will need to be represented on the Verus blockchain. This will be handled by Verus\u2019 decentralized bridging capabilities, and will be discussed in a future article.\nThere is a base fee for conversions of 0.025%, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. There is also an additional implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees.\nAt the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.\n\n\nValue for Miners & Stakers: Economy of the Verus Protocol\nSince Verus is an open, borderless and decentralised blockchain project, it is important to create value for the people who maintain the network; the miners and stakers. No value whatsoever goes to the Verus Coin Foundation, either through founder fees or developer fees. All fees are 100% recycled through mining and staking to create the groundwork for a thriving economy.\nMining and Staking VRSC\nIf a miner or staker on the Verus blockchain wins the competition to generate a new block, this is what\u2019s included:\nBlock reward of 24 VRSC (Halving to 12 VRSC takes place at block #1,278,000 [see halving countdown], with another halving every 1,051,920 blocks)\nVerusID: 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 VRSC (What is paid to the miner or staker is dependent on referrals when creating a VerusID)\nConversion fee of 0.025% (This is the cost of converting to and from reserve currencies, paid in the currencies of the conversions)\nTransaction fees of 0.0001 VRSC (For every transaction happening on the chain)\nMerge-Mining\nMiners of the Verus blockchain can choose to mine up to 22 other chains, simultaneously, created in the PBaaS ecosystem, without losing any of the hashing power if you were to only mine Verus. This practically multiplies your CPU or GPU power by 22! This process is called Merge-Mining and is available to everyone. When Merge-Mining and staking you can earn the following:\nBlock rewards of 22 other chains\nNotarization fees in VRSC (To make chances higher that you will mine a chain, creators can choose to add VRSC to the block rewards)\nAdditionally, you can stake as many coins as you want in the PBaaS ecosystem.\n\n\nTo answer the original question: Is Verus poised to challenge Ethereum? If you consider all the technological advancements Verus is making, like the use of smart transactions for robust DeFi, scalability through PBaaS chain creation, the decentralized identity system that ties it all together and a thriving economy for miners and stakers, then, yes, Verus can challenge Ethereum.\nDownload the wallet now to try fractional reserve currencies on testnet.

Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications for services that could almost be free but not quite.\nIt can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail. The send dialog is resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like. It\u2019s sent directly when it connects. The recipient doubleclicks on the transaction to see the full message. If someone famous is getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and give out the IP address on their website. \u201cSend X bitcoins to my priority hotline at this IP and I\u2019ll read the message personally.\u201d\nSubscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their free trial so it doesn\u2019t cannibalize subscriptions could charge bitcoins for the trial.\nIt might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org\nWhen I stumbled upon this email around the new year, it struck me how accurate these predictions have manifested. I also had to stop and look a little deeper and ask what more might Satoshi have envisioned than simply \u201cdigital cash.\u201d Although bitcoin was originally used as digital money, I believe Satoshi saw it as much, much more\u2026and believe this email eludes to it.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Blockchain?\nIt occurred to me that the simple application of money in the bitcoin, was only the beginning of progress and what is possible to expand from this original use case. Particularly the underlying theme of blockchain services is an innovative progression of the invention of bitcoin.\nThe Verus Coin\u2019s project vision is a marketplace of provisioned public blockchains as a service (PBaaS) that are used to run public applications, including polls and voting. The goal is ultimately decentralized applications that provision and use these chains automatically, paying Verus miners, stakers, and service providers for provisioning and services.\nVerus is a 100% fairly launched, no-ICO, no-pre-mine community project and introduces a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Power, a 50% proof of work / 50% proof of stake algorithm, which solves theoretical weaknesses in other PoS systems and is provably immune to 51% hash attacks, making Verus one of, if not the most double-spend resistant public blockchain(s) running.\nWith its groundbreaking consensus protocol, Verus also uses a unique hash algorithm, VerusHash 2.0, a quantum secure hash algorithm that is near-equally mineable on both CPUs and GPUs. Verus Coin also offers the most advanced zero-knowledge privacy available, using Sapling-generation zk-SNARKs for fast, secure, private transactions and messages.\nIf you would like to learn more about Verus Coin and get involved in any way, whether in mining and helping secure the blockchain or through contributing and joining the community (or both!), visit the official site at https://veruscoin.io and join the official Verus Discord.\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: Verus Public Blockchains as a Service: Fractional Reserve Currencies\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-public-blockchains-as-a-service-fractional-reserve-currencies-274c8b3b3a94\nContent:\n\nVerus Public Blockchains as a Service: Fractional Reserve Currencies\nPhoto by istolethetv under the CC by 2.0 license\nJust as Elon Musk said it would probably be easier to land a craft on Mars than convince NASA that he could, we believe focusing resources on completing the best possible implementation of Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) rather than telling people all about how great it will be is how to get this technology to the people of the world sooner rather than later, so they can benefit from and experience it themselves.\nThat said, my heads down focus and that of other Verus developers in the past few weeks may have left some community members otherwise used to seeing me around Discord on a daily basis wondering what exactly is going on behind their screens. I\u2019ve put together this update on Verus PBaaS reserves, and the state of community development at the present to help briefly explain some things.\nAt any time and for virtually any volume, Verus will be convertible in a fully automatic way between Verus and native fractional reserve currencies through simple transactions and PBaaS reserve protocols.\nVerus fractional reserve currencies will be the native currencies of Verus PBaaS chains that choose to share liquidity across the Verus ecosystem. All PBaaS blockchains that are launched as Verus fractional reserves will control a certain amount of Verus Coin on the Verus blockchain that will serve as the reserves for those chains. The reserves may represent 100%, 50%, or even 10% of the total market cap of a PBaaS blockchain.\nExplaining the details of how these fractional reserve currencies work is not the purpose of this update. Although PBaaS reserve currency conversion is built into the blockchain protocol, charges no centralized fees, addresses the infamous front-running problem, and can be mined and staked while emitting new coins in the process, the model is very similar to Bancor reserves. The Bancor whitepaper is a good place to start if you want an introduction into cryptographic fractional reserve currencies and how conversions work. At any time and for virtually any volume, Verus will be convertible in a fully automatic way between Verus and native fractional reserve currencies through simple transactions and PBaaS reserve protocols.\nImportantly, conversion is not a buy or a sell from or to another individual, it is a protocol conversion. To convert any amount, you need no buyer on the other side of a \u201csell\u201d and no seller in order to buy. Converting to a currency will cause the currency conversion rate (price) to rise, according to proven, market-based mathematical formulas, and converting from will have the opposite effect.\nWith PBaaS reserve currencies, there cannot be a shortage of liquidity across the ecosystem, since the order books are always the entire supply and reserve of the currency. In addition, currency can be sent automatically from the Verus blockchain to a PBaaS reserve blockchain, arriving to the specified address as either Verus Reserve Tokens, or auto-converted at the current market price (causing the price to rise slightly according to the reserve currency formulas) to the native currency of the destination chain. Unlike complex APIs that make cross-chain operations difficult for the average user, the latest big advance in this area is a protocol that makes it as easy to send from one chain to another as it is today to send a simple transaction.\nVerus fractional reserve currencies will have decentralized capabilities and benefits that are fundamentally new both to crypto and also to historical human money.\nVerus reserve tokens that have already arrived on a PBaaS chain will be convertible at any time to the native coin without waiting for notarization and cross-chain transactions, and also may be used similarly to a native coin in a wallet. Any fractional reserve currency can also be sent back to the Verus chain and auto-converted to Verus along the way. Even when sending Verus reserve tokens on a fractional reserve blockchain with its own native currency, symbol, and project, no explicit conversion or Gas is needed to prevent DoS attacks from flooding a chain with transactions. In fact, when Verus reserve token is sent from one transaction to another on a PBaaS reserve chain, network fees are automatically paid in Verus, which is converted on the fly to the native currency of the chain.\nVerus fractional reserve currencies will have decentralized capabilities and benefits that are fundamentally new both to crypto and also to historical human money. Some are described above and the power of those capabilities will be evident if given some thought, but there are also some very deep concepts that I\u2019d like to at least touch on before getting back to the code.\nThe Verus PBaaS protocol will allow fully community funded fairly-launched reserve currency projects, corporate currencies, and more, that all share liquidity with the rest of the entire Verus ecosystem.\nOne major benefit of the protocol is that across the entire multi-blockchain network of reserve currencies, all liquidity is fully shared and grows as the network grows and is used. The value of a currency going up and down will depend much less on how thin an order book is and much more on its fundamentally recognized value. For example, if a business that accepts Verus, such as La Pasta here in Seattle, decides to make their own reserve currency for food, and offers discounts for purchases with their crypto, the more people who use it, the more people who will convert to it, and the higher their coin\u2019s conversion price will naturally be.\nIn addition, the Verus PBaaS protocol will allow fully community funded fairly-launched reserve currency projects, corporate currencies, and more, that all share liquidity with the rest of the entire Verus ecosystem. As a fully decentralized protocol with no company to take a cut along the way, any blockchain costs to launch a PBaaS project on Verus are paid directly to miners and stakers for verification, notarization, and initial conversion of Verus to the PBaaS reserve currency. Any range of the contributions to a reserve blockchain launch, from 0\u2013100% of proceeds, can be transparently routed to the reserves of the fractional reserve currency, with the remainder being distributed, also transparently, as determined by those who launch the chain.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that we are not building these technologies to just talk about them or claim that we did something. We strongly believe that the world needs Verus PBaaS and fractional reserve currencies. Some of us are helping exciting new projects work on use cases in addition to those described in the Verus vision paper, and we fully expect these projects to leverage PBaaS reserve technologies.\nIn one very powerful sense, the Verus reserve ecosystem will have no need for and no overhead imposed by money changers, a virtue that is going to be more and more important as it grows.\nFinally, to introduce some specifics about what exactly has been going on in my deep, dark development hole for the past few weeks:\nWe realized that if the process of moving currency from one chain to another or converting currencies was too complex, fewer people would use it. That led to the idea that you should be able to send from Verus to XYZ chain and wait for your currency to arrive on XYZ chain as either Verus reserve or XYZ, which should happen based on a decentralized protocol, without any further action by you.\nWe also realized that if we make it that easy, many people are likely to do it, which would make cross-chain transactions a very common occurrence and therefore, something that needs to scale more than a simple one send/one cross-transaction relationship. To solve this, I\u2019m nearly finished developing a new, decentralized cross chain protocol, designed for high volume, provable cross-chain transaction flow with minimal per-transaction overhead. Doing that meant committing to some additional development time, but we believe in the power of this system to help society, and it is more important to get it right than have it deployed a few weeks earlier.\nPersonally, I predict that ease of use won\u2019t be the only reason cross-chain conversions will be popular.\nAll buys and sells in any given block will get the exact same conversion price with no spread and all conversion fees will be a flat 0.05%, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers on the Verus and PBaaS blockchains, which of course can all be merge-mined together. This 0.05% both incentivizes miners and stakers to follow the new protocol as intended, and allows fill-or-kill order types that eliminate the risk of front-running. Even at that incredibly small rate, it also provides huge opportunity for decentralized mining and staking profit to anyone who helps validate the Verus PBaaS ecosystem. In one very powerful sense, the Verus reserve ecosystem will have no need for and no overhead imposed by money changers, a virtue that is going to be more and more important as it grows.\nTo conclude, I wanted to provide a general update on development progress that I know about and a more in-depth update on some of the exciting technologies we\u2019re planning to deploy soon on testnet, followed shortly after by mainnet. As many community members know by now, I do not generally make predictions on timing of releases, and in the latest Crypto-Rich interview, I said that I hoped to get PBaaS reserves out by the end of July. I suspect we will hit early August for full testnet deployment, but I feel very good about where things are now and cannot fully convey how excited I am about PBaaS\u2019s revolutionary technologies that you will soon be able to experience yourself.\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: Get Ahead of the Game with Verus\u2019 Groundbreaking 1:1 Decentralized Currency Mapping for ERC-20\u2026\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/get-ahead-of-the-game-with-verus-groundbreaking-1-1-decentralized-currency-mapping-for-erc-20-cc23584a7037\nContent:\n\nGet Ahead of the Game with Verus\u2019 Groundbreaking 1:1 Decentralized Currency Mapping for ERC-20 Tokens\nIn this article, we show you how to map and bridge an Ethereum ERC-20 token to the Verus testnet blockchain as a currency one-to-one. We use the groundbreaking non-custodial and provable Verus-Ethereum bridge, and we don\u2019t even need to code anything!\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Note that this walkthrough is for the Verus Testnet blockchain, which simulates the Verus blockchain once the PBaaS-upgrade (Public Blockchains as a Service) is brought to mainnet. Also, the commands are for macOS and Linux, as Windows works a bit differently. We use the CLI wallet for Verus. Download here \ud83d\udd17 You can also use Verus Desktop with its incorporated terminal.\nThe Verus-Ethereum Bridge\n\ud83d\udc49 All tokens and currencies flowing over the bridge are never in anyone\u2019s custody, and are proven and verified by consensus rules.\nThe Verus-Ethereum bridge is the first of its kind. Because it is permissionless, non-custodial and provable. We can:\nsend and receive ETH and ERC-20s to and from Verus and Ethereum\nsend and receive currencies launched on Verus to and from Ethereum\nconvert currencies through the bridge converter currency. Use on Ethereum as well as on Verus. Learn more on bridge converter currencies \ud83d\udd17\nDefining a Currency\nDefining a currency on the Verus network is simple, just two commands are all you need. When the currency is successfully launched it can flow around within the protocol, and outside of the protocol (like an ERC-20, in our example). Let\u2019s get started.\nVerusID Namespace\n\nBefore defining the currency, we already registered the VerusID MaxUSDC@. This cost us 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 when using a referral), which were distributed to the block producers. These costs can drastically vary depending on which PBaaS-chain you create a VerusID.\nVerusID is the namespace for currencies and PBaaS-blockchains, among many other things. Learn more about VerusID \ud83d\udd17\nDefining the mapped currency\nDefining a currency costs 200 VRSCTEST. These costs can change depending on which blockchain you want to define a currency. When launching PBaaS-chains you can define your own costs in the chains\u2019 native currency. Good to know: these costs are going to the miners and stakers of the blockchain.\nWith a few simple commands we will:\nDefine a currency mapped to the USDC Ethereum contract with a registered namespace (VerusID) on the Verus Testnet blockchain\nExport the currency to Ethereum through the non-custodial, provable bridge \ud83d\udd17\nBefore we can define the currency which is mapped to USDC on Ethereum, we must fund MaxUSDC@ with enough VRSCTEST to launch the currency. And after that with enough vETH or VRSCTEST to pay for the gas fees that export the currency to Ethereum.\n200+ VRSCTEST to launch the currency, and around 0.05 vETH or equivalent worth of VRSCTEST to export the currency to Ethereum.\nFund your VerusID with vETH in two ways:\nSend ETH to Verus (into vETH) with the Verus-Ethereum bridge \ud83d\udd17\nConvert VRSCTEST or any other currency into vETH using Verus\u2019 protocol level DeFi more info on how to convert \ud83d\udd17\nThe command that defines our currency MaxUSDC, which is mapped to the ERC-20 USDC (Goerli Testnet) contract address on Etherscan \ud83d\udd17, is as follows:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"MaxUSDC\", \n \"options\":32, \n \"systemid\":\"veth\", \n \"parent\":\"vrsctest\", \n \"launchsystemid\":\"vrsctest\", \n \"nativecurrencyid\":{\n   \"type\":9, \n   \"address\":\"0x98339D8C260052B7ad81c28c16C0b98420f2B46a\"\n   }, \n \"initialsupply\":0, \n \"proofprotocol\":3\n}'\n\u2b50 To learn more about the many different launch options when defining a currency on Verus, go here \ud83d\udd17 We encourage anyone to start testing the protocol to get ahead of the game. The community is happy to help on Discord \ud83d\udd17\nWhen we do the command above we get returned a HEX. Only after we make a transaction with the HEX, will the currency launch be broadcasted to the network. See below:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction \"hex\"\nNow you can see the currency on the Verus network. We just need to make sure it\u2019s on Ethereum as well.\nExporting the mapped currency\nNow, let\u2019s export the currency from Verus to Ethereum as an ERC-20 over the non-custodial bridge. We do this with the following command:\n./verus chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"MaxUSDC@\" '[{\n  \"address\":\"0xAD84C9EE28FB4c3b9C6ef1B86D1ED00A82DB84E9\", \n  \"currency\":\"MaxUSDC\", \n  \"amount\":0, \n  \"exportto\":\"veth\", \n  \"exportcurrency\":true, \n  \"feecurrency\":\"veth\"\n}]'\nNote: the first MaxUSDC@ field is the change address for fees being returned to you, and the address is the Verus-Ethereum non-custodial smart contract bridge address. You can also omit feecurrency if you would rather pay the export fees in VRSCTEST.\nAfter the bridge has been notarized to the blockheight where you have exported the currency, you can choose it from the token dropdown on the bridge website \ud83d\udd17.\nERC-20s on Verus\nAfter sending from Ethereum to Verus, the token is free to move through the Internet of Value on the Verus network, across PBaaS-blockchains, and also back & forth with Ethereum.\nAs easily as the token was first defined and launched, it can now become one of the reserves in a multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM as part of Verus DeFi.\nAnybody can define a multi-reserve currency which includes MaxUSDC as a reserve with weighted percentage (10\u201390%). The reserves grow as they retain a small fee whenever assets are traded in/out/through.\nA multi-reserve currency itself can also be used as one of the reserves in another multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM token on Verus.\n\ud83d\udc40 Stay tuned for more on this later, or start reading docs.verus.io, or join the Discord to learn.\n\ud83e\udee1 Credits for the article go to community member \u2018ejuliano\u2019.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Explore with the community on Discord\nFollow on Twitter\nGo to verus.io\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: Introducing Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS)\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Revolutionary Layer 0/1 Protocol\u2026\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/introducing-public-blockchains-as-a-service-pbaas-the-revolutionary-layer-0-1-protocol-79c069ffe178\nContent:\n\nIntroducing Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) \u2014 The Revolutionary Layer 0/1 Protocol Launches its Most Anticipated Mainnet Upgrade\nAfter years of hard work and dedication, on the fifth anniversary, the worldwide Verus community is excited to announce the launch of the highly anticipated mainnet upgrade on May 23. The Public Blockchains as a Service release marks a major milestone for Verus and the entire cryptocurrency industry.\n\n\u23f1\ufe0f PBaaS activation: block height 2,549,420 (Tuesday 23 May 2023)\nUpgrade to this release or a later version v1.0.0-x, before MAY 23, 2023 to stay reliably connected to mainnet. Download here \ud83d\udd17\nTestnet release will allow you to connect to the new testnet, which we see as a core development platform and staging area for the Verus PBaaS network and have no plans to reset in any foreseeable future.\nTurning the Crypto Industry on its Head\nThe wide cryptocurrency industry will see how much better Verus PBaaS is as a solution for true decentralization in cross-chain, DeFi AMMs, on-chain P2P exchange, self-sovereign provable recoverable IDs, NFT capabilities, anti-phishing, anti-MEV, scale, or just about any of the challenges people have on crypto platforms today. In fact, as we prepare for activation of this protocol that enables so many new use cases for crypto, not to mention easy onboarding when entrepreneurs discover how to really leverage VerusIDs, PBaaS is so far beyond what people are experiencing on any crypto platform today that it has been easy to dismiss our community as describing the impossible.\nOnce PBaaS is live on mainnet and people can actually use all of this themselves, along with every project, chain and currency on the PBaaS network and EVERY ERC20 or ERC721 on Ethereum or even bridged to Ethereum, the truth of Verus will be self-evident, and those who build on Verus will more easily build faster, better, more secure apps and services with the possibility of provable identity + privacy, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts all seamlessly integrated into UIs that do not need business deals, permission, or any centralized infrastructure to connect services and users, enabling everyone to communicate in provable, private, or public ways that always include bidirectional, secure commerce of all kinds.\nCore Capabilities\nThe core capabilities of this release include (lots to learn to understand it all, but here\u2019s a partial list):\nVerus Internet Protocol (VIP) \u2014 Layer 0 Multichain and Inter-chain Protocol\nTo our knowledge, the VIP protocol is the only fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology available on any network that is based on cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state. From what we\u2019ve been able to learn about LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, Thorchain or others, VIP is different from (though closest in some ways to LayerZero), superior to, and more decentralized than all other cross-chain protocols we have seen. We can of course get into any level of discussion on the topic, but expect more descriptions and educational material to follow, now that the protocol was originally conceived of 5 years ago, and has been developed and tested/hardened for years.\nVerusID Content Multimaps \u2014 Unlimited Provable Data for Every VerusID\nOf course this upgrade retains all of the groundbreaking capabilities already available with VerusID, including multisig options, separate revocation and recovery authorities for maximum security to prevent theft of identity or funds, and the ability to timelock your ID, enabling you to even thwart attempts to access your funds after someone compromised your secret keys.\nWith the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs also gain a powerful new capability that amounts to an unlimited, rent-free indexed database for every VerusID on every blockchain of the PBaaS network. This data can be encrypted or published in the clear and used for any purpose or application, whether social networking, voting, oracles, publishing any information, various forms of provable attestations, ratings, and much, much more. With the scalability of PBaaS and VerusID content multimaps together, the Verus PBaaS network becomes the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world. We don\u2019t believe anything else even comes close, and with the recent rise of AI, it feels great to have this come together as a core original goal at a very appropriate and important time in history.\nPermissionless Chain, Token, and Liquidity Basket Currency Launches\nWhether you are looking to crowdfund an effort in a manner much like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, sell identities to which you expect to add value or that are sub-IDs of a very cool root ID, or launch an entirely new blockchain economy and blockchain that starts with all of the Verus technology and a bridge to Verus and Ethereum from day 1, Verus is probably the best platform for you. In fact, as we were planning for the next testnet and wanted to have our own version of DAI to use in the bridge, since we want only decentralized currencies in the live mainnet bridge, we used a command to launch a token on the old testnet, exported it and all its supply to Ethereum\u2019s Goerli on the existing bridge, and that will be the DAI proxy/simulant that we will use on the new testnet. It saved us all some time, proving that Verus PBaaS will also be the easiest, most efficient way to launch even an Ethereum ERC20, whether that ERC20 represents a token, DeFi basket, or even another PBaaS blockchain\nVerus enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it.\nAll PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\nVerus also enables any ID owner to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners, stakers, and liquidity providers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\nDecentralized Ethereum Bridge\nShortly after PBaaS activates on mainnet, the Ethereum bridge will launch as a decentralized gateway and 1:1 provably mapped currency called \u201cvETH\u201d on the Verus network, also available to all PBaaS chains. The Ethereum bridge will also include a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI, which will have the following functions:\nAuto conversion of fees from Verus <-> Ethereum when sending cross chain, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket\nPermissionless ability to register *.vETH IDs, which in addition to the normal sub-ID capability of creating a single token that has control over the ID and can be exported to Ethereum as an automatic ERC721 NFT, can alternately be used to create a \u201cmapped currency\u201d, which can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network by exporting it to the vETH bridge. Only Verus root IDs, and IDs of a gateway can create mapped currencies to a gateway.\nDecentralized, fair bridge launch. The vETH bridge will launch as other currencies, chains, and gateways can launch, including the bridge converter. When the bridge launches, the contracts will have a surplus of Verus that comes from the fees paid to launch the gateway. In the protocol, that surplus is first used to solve the chicken and egg problem of none of one currency on the other chain. The contracts will cover the Verus fees for all sends from Ethereum before the Bridge converter launches, the liquidity basket becomes active, and the bridge recognizes that launch. Once that happens, the remainder of \u00bd the fees (5000 VRSC) that are left over from the launch and did not go to miners and stakers or pay Verus fees for people sending from Ethereum.\nThe Verus Fee Pool and Rewards\nAnother technology and solution unique to Verus, the Verus Fee Pool technology goes live with PBaaS. What this means is that as people use the cross-chain, DeFi, or purchase/register IDs on the network, the miner or staker will put all fees into the on-chain \u201cfee pool\u201d, and then take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward. This gives everyone incentive to still prioritize transactions based on fees, while preventing validators from gaming the fee system by washing fees-in vs. fees-out or working to reorg/rewind to capture a particularly juicy block reward. Instead, this technology aligns all validator incentives with the health/proper operation of the network and creates a circular on-chain economy that can last well beyond block rewards.\nTo know more about Verus PBaaS capabilities read this article \ud83d\udd17\nA Historic Move Forward\nFor those who actually understand the challenges actual users have in crypto today, this release represents a historic move forward in public cryptographic networks and credibly and actually neutral infrastructure for society-wide human and AI collaboration and learning. As a community, this version really does realize the vision laid out in the original Verus Vision Paper, and at the same time provides much more than was described there. We are a community of individuals, and it is only because that is what we are that we have all arrived here together. The rest of the world is stuck on their Munchausen\u2019s protocols, trying to figure out how to share the front-running and back-running spoils taken from users, but Verus activation gives them a better path forward.\nAs a community, we do not promise, we describe a shared vision and welcome contributors from everywhere. Now that we, as a community, have delivered on the original phases described in the first vision paper together, it is time for each of us to also consider what we might personally want to build or be part of building over this incredible, geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform. Our next efforts across the community should be to realize the promise of this network in the use cases we create, use cases that we will have an advantage creating on Verus over any other platform because it really is that much better.\nRead the release notes on GitHub for CLI \ud83d\udd17 and GUI \ud83d\udd17\nThanks to the incredible combined efforts of so many people in the community ranging from development, companies and projects joining and their open contributions (Valu/Arkeytyp, CHIPS, vDEX, VaultAlert, cragslist, Electricty Supply Board of Ireland and more) to community members supporting users to helping educate others who can contribute as well, we have run these protocols now for years as we\u2019ve improved them, and all of these capabilities will go live on the Verus mainnet May 21, 2023, with the activation expected targeting block 2,546,600.\nJoin the community.

Rather, based on a \u201cStaking Algorithm\u201d developed by the blockchain developers, stakers simply run the staking wallet for the blockchain and have that blockchain\u2019s cryptocurrency in the wallet as their staking balance.\nThe staking software then generates one single \u201cvote\u201d per block, which is essentially a prediction of the next block, and submits the vote to determine if the staker won. It\u2019s essentially a \u201cfree vote\u201d, besides the cost of crypto funds in the staker\u2019s wallet to participate.\nNothing at Stake\nWith \u201cvoting\u201d on the next block not requiring expensive computational power or external costs such as electricity, etc, as in PoW, staking is essentially a cost-free endeavor. The only cost involved is the stake of the blockchain\u2019s currency into the staking wallet.\nA normal outcome in any blockchain is when more than one block is generated simultaneously. In cases such as this, in a normal and cheat free chain, one block is kept and the chain keeps building on down that path\u2026while the other block is orphaned.\nWith generating a vote being free with no intensive computer work necessary, what\u2019s to stop a nefarious staker from casting a double vote? One for the block upon which the chain continues to build..and one on the orphaned or \u201cforked\u201d chain as well? In fact, since votes are free, why not generate many votes every block, to potentially multiply block rewards\u2026effectively double spending on the network?\nThis, in a very basic nutshell, is known as the \u201cnothing at stake\u201d problem which is theorized as an argument against PoS being a good and secure consensus mechanism. This nothing at stake problem results in a threat to the security, reliability and immutability of a blockchain and therefore threatens it\u2019s existence.\nWeak Subjectivity\nSubjectivity in blockchain is the theory that there can be multiple potential versions of a blockchain which appear correct. This is fine so long as the software being used to connect to the blockchain cannot automatically choose between these.\nSubjectivity is discussed in Proof of Stake because, unlike Proof of Work, there is no objective chain with most proven computational work to find the correct ledger.\nWeak Subjectivity specifically, is the theory that subjectivity is a problem over a short period of time\u2026but not over a long period of time.\nIn the case of Proof of Stake vs Proof of Work, this becomes an area of concern for the validity and security of a blockchain, especially when measured against Proof of Work and validating a chain based on most work\u2026the longest chain or \u201cmost work\u201d rule.\nWithout \u201cmost work\u201d how would you strengthen the subjectivity of the blockchain, moving it towards a more objective chain?\nThe Race to Solve the Nothing at Stake Problem\nUntil now most attempts at solving this very critical theoretical problem are based in \u201cafter the fact\u201d defense and \u201cpunishment\u201d mechanisms to try to punish cheating which may occur.\nSuch solution attempts are not approaching the problem in the way which models Proof of Work\u2026wherein the cheating doesn\u2019t occur in the first place due to the design of the blockchain. Instead many are tacking on voting and approval systems which add complex layers and then have to \u201cdetangle\u201d the complexity of who\u2019s cheating, who\u2019s playing fair, and how to punish the cheaters.\nFrom proposals of complex, computationally heavy, time-costly and punishment-based approaches\u2026to centralized systems designed to analyze and choose the legitimate blocks and react to cheating\u2026every attempt at solving this problem to date, comes at either great cost of performance, principle, or complexity and convolution of code.\nIn short, most attempts are a reactionary approach which is not inherent within the PoS or blockchain code. What has always given PoW the upper hand is it\u2019s simplicity and implicity.\nSomething at Stake, Simply and Implicitly\nVerus has solved the problem of Nothing at Stake while removing Weak Subjectivity. This innovative improvement coming to the Verus blockchain is removing any incentive to attempt cheating, making it a losing proposition. This, combined with a new \u201cChain Power\u201d rule which will replace \u201cChain Work\u201d, presents the PoW+PoS blockchain as a far superior consensus model over PoW.\nTo Catch a Cheater\nBefore digging into the crazy complicated blockchain lingo, let\u2019s walk through the process of someone attempting to cheat on the new Verus upgraded blockchain, and see how it works in plain English.\nFor starters the cheater needs to develop a specialized wallet which will attempt the cheats. Let\u2019s call our nefarious clever cheater Jamie.\nJamie loads up her self-coded/modified cheat wallet with some Verus and begins staking on the Verus blockchain. Let\u2019s say to cheat she is simply trying to \u201cdouble spend\u201d by casting her votes on both the main chain and any forked or orphaned block at the time of staking.\nWhen Jamie does this and \u201cwins\u201d a block reward, that reward is immature for 100 blocks before it can be spent. At this time she sees the reward in her wallet. On the forked/orphaned chain she has a duplicate stake voted, with a matching UTXO to the main chain\u2019s stake. At maturity, she plans on pulling a fast one and double spending.\nMeanwhile, Stacy is scanning the blockchain hunting for cheat rewards. Her scan catches Jamie\u2019s cheat attempt. What does this mean?\n100 blocks passes and when the reward matures it gets spent, meaning it is \u201cshielded\u201d which is how Coinbase Rewards are spent after maturing. But, cheater Jamie didn\u2019t even get a chance to shield it\u2026it now shows as spent and in place of the funds on the blockchain is proof that she was cheating in the form of her double stake on the fork.\nStacy has taken the reward and it\u2019s now in her private address, ready to unshield and add to her wallet. A nice little bonus of \u201cfree money\u201d for finding the cheated transaction.\nHad Jamie simply staked as normal, without cheating, she would never risk losing her reward.\nAnd here\u2019s the coolest part. All of this occurs on the blockchain level. There is no need for any special layers, filtering or convolution, or centralization to be added.\nIt\u2019s also a completely decentralized solution, motivating the entire network to participate in finding and catching cheaters. After all, for 100 blocks any such cheated rewards will be visible and locked up in \u201cimmaturity\u201d, giving motivated \u201ccheat hunters\u201d the opportunity scan and find such transactions.\nThis decentralized anti-cheat process will be built into Verus mining software, meaning the most likely person to spend the cheater\u2019s block reward will be the miner who mines the block at which the cheater reward matures.\nAnd in the meantime, that other staked block, the one that gave away the cheater, is unable to be double spent. Because the rule is in place that only allows the UTXO to be spent once by either the owner/originator or the cheat hunter.\nUnpacking the Technical Stuff\nBy \u201crewiring\u201d the way in which Verus performs staking, the blockchain is approaching staking fundamentally similar to how mining works. Within Verus you have the same probabilistic selection based on Staking Power as with Proof of Work. This means you don\u2019t have to pre-invest stake, in order to stake.\nThe Verus blockchain inherently makes staking equivocal with mining in probability, fairness, and security while obliterating the nothing at stake problem and weak subjectivity (which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment)\u2026resulting in a blockchain that is arguably more robust, secure, and capable than a simple PoW chain.\nVerus Crypto Conditions\nCrypto Conditions, or CC, are smart contracts for Komodo-based blockchains. Developed by Komodo, CCs extend the capabilities of a bitcoin-type blockchain to allow more functionality and scripting on the blockchain level.\nTo effectively use CCs for Verus\u2019 purposes, Mike extended some of the capabilities of Crypto Conditions, particularly adding more meta data definitions and allowing CC transactions to act more like \u201cnormal\u201d transactions. With the modified CCs Verus is able to implement powerful functionality that extends the flexibility and resultant power of the Verus blockchain in preparation for PBaaS and the services which will be able to be coded into blockchains in the future.\nStake Guard is the first Verus Crypto Condition to be released and it\u2019s what solves the \u201cnothing at stake\u201d problem and performs the \u201cmagic\u201d.\nStake Guard \u2014 The Proof of Stake Crypto Condition\nThis new CC which Verus has developed and is adding to the blockchain, works in conjunction with a newly modified signing script when staking and spending a reward.\nThe result is a blockchain-level Crypto Condition which handles all staking transaction spends, either processing them as usual for normal shakers, or allowing any cheated stake transaction containing its stake block reward to be spent by anyone who can prove its indeed a cheaters stake. No double spending occurs at any point, to cheat the cheater had a real stake plus additional cheat attempts at any given block. Only the legitimate stake reward can be spent when proven.\nHere\u2019s how it works.\nWhen staking a new block, a new format of transaction called a Staking Transaction is generated. This transaction format is enforced and utilizes the Stake Guard at the minting of the new block. It contains more meta data, such as the public key of the staker who signed it, the UTXO, the block height, and previous block height.\nIf a cheater has tried to stake on more forks at the same block height, that cheat attempt is also recorded. Anyone scanning the blockchain can see it and verify that it\u2019s indeed a cheat attempt, as the data is there immutably and without the ability to manipulate things like UTXO or information about the blockchain at the time of the stake.\nFor the community, this is an opportunity of 100 blocks to look for any such cheat attempts and tuck them away to take at that cheat transactions maturity. Also important to note: UTXO can only be spent once, so there\u2019s no risk of double spending at this point. And the cheater\u2019s one valid block reward is able to be taken by anyone who sees it and spends it at block maturity.\nAfter 100 blocks when any block reward is spent, it passes through the Stake Guard Crypto Condition script which evaluates the spend transaction for 1 of 2 things:\nCondition a \u2014 Is this spend being signed by the Public Key which staked it?\nCondition b \u2014 Is proof presented in the OP_RETURN that this is a cheater\u2019s block reward?\n Result\u2014 Depending on one of the two conditions being met, Stake Guard will validate or reject the spend.\nCondition a: if a normal staker is trying to shield their stake reward, their public key is being passed automatically to Stake Guard which compares it to the public key in the meta data of the stake transaction on the blockchain. They match, so it signs it as normal and the staker has their reward.\nCondition b: if the public key of the spender does NOT match the original staker public key, Stake Guard verifies that the cheat transaction proof has been submitted in the OP_RETURN.\nThe proof of a cheated transaction, the data bits packed up from that duplicate stake transaction which the Cheat Hunter found, is passed in an OP_RETURN and the Stake Guard CC evaluates and confirms that it is indeed a verifiable cheated transaction. It does this by comparing the matching UTXOs of the legitimate and cheated staking transactions, their respective previous block heights, and their respective block heights at the time they were generated. In fact, this is another case of validating signatures to cryptographically verify that the stake transaction was properly signed, meaning proof of cheating cannot be forged.\nIf Stake Guard confirms the cheat transaction is indeed a cheat, the spend of the cheaters stake reward at the time of the cheat, is signed using the Stake Guard\u2019s key and spent to the shielded address provided by the person who claimed the cheater\u2019s reward. The wallet of the person who found the cheat reward is paid the block reward and it disappears from the cheater\u2019s wallet.\nDecentralized Anti-Cheat Staking\nAs mentioned above, for legitimate stakers the Stake Guard CC will function normally, signing the coinbase reward transaction when they spend it with their own Public Key\u2026all in the background and at the blockchain level.\nIf, however, the 1 of 2 evaluation sees the public key of the person trying to spend it doesn\u2019t match that of the original staker it simply verifies the person trying to take the free money from the cheater has proven that this is indeed a cheated transaction which they discovered and if so, will let them take it.\nThis can be done by anyone who knows how to pack up the data after scanning and finding cheat attempt staking transactions\u2026but will also be implemented into the mining software by Verus to perform the attempted spend of the cheaters reward block when mining at the block where that cheat reward matures.\nNo Incentive to Cheat\nThe cheaters one single legitimate reward block out of the two attempts they made to double spend, is no longer locked in to be spent by them alone. Anyone can now spend this by simply proving to the Stake Guard CC the verified cheat transaction hash in an OP_RETURN.\nSo, while even the cheater can try to run and grab it with the rest of the network, or try to spend it before anyone else, now the odds are stacked against them\u2026and why even cheat? Afterall, there is no double spend available due to the fundamental way in which the blockchain is modified with this Stake Guard.\nIt simply makes no sense, using the same logic PoW uses, decentralizing the process of catching and being rewarded for finding cheat transactions by getting the cheaters reward, and makes legitimate staking more rewarding by itself. And if cheaters do try anyway, the legitimate staker has a better chance of even claiming those rewards which the system makes publicly visible.\nChain Power and Nonce\nAnother important change being implemented in this new Verus upgrade is moving away from Chain Work to what Verus is calling Chain Power. Chain Power is now replacing Chain Work, solving the threat of Weak Subjectivity.\nChain Work\nWithin chain work, the block index is a sequential index of block entries which \u201cknows the height\u201d of the chain. As you build and add blocks, you add the entry to the block index.\nThis way at any point you have a maintained value that reflects the chain work at that point. The Chain Work is normally a sum of the proof of work difficulty, for any set of blocks.\nChain Power\nChain Power is a 50% of one value and 50% of another value comparative calculation. It\u2019s a tracking of both Work and Stake.\nChain Work is based on a number that everyone calculates the same on every block. You can\u2019t be completely sure of the time and date someone makes a block. So on a very small scale someone could make it seem like they had a little more work, just for a moment.\nWith Chain Power Verus will not just take the Proof of Stake difficulty, it also takes the actual nonce random amount of work from every block, adding it as additional Stake Power. This way no two blocks will match and there\u2019s no way to manipulate this value.\nThis nonce \u201cwork\u201d number will be added to the Stake Difficulty. Someone can\u2019t just grind away at this as a result.\nAnd so, Verus, as a \u201chybrid\u201d combination of Proof of Stake and Proof of Work, will now have a value which is calculated from a comparison between Stake and Work. If stake power is at 20% and work power is at 30% for example, that is a sum total of 50% Chain Power.\nWhat this means is, to attack the blockchain in a way in which weak subjectivity is a problem, the attacker would need to have more than 50% of either staking or mining power given the above example.\nThe implications of this are massive, making a hybrid Chain Power blockchain like Verus a weak subjectivity resistant chain and adding capabilities that far outweigh the security of traditional Chain Work in Proof of Work chains.\nFinally, Verus adds to this Chain Power \u201cpowerhouse\u201d mechanism, delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) by Komodo, extending it\u2019s security even further. Arguably not even necessary given the advancement of Chain Power, dPoW is an additional layer of security and immutability against attack attempts.\nThe Magic in the Logic\nThese improvements and innovations are being released along with Verus Sapling, the latest upgrade from Zcash which Verus is activating at block 227520 (October 30, 2018).\nIn speaking with Mike over the past week it also became apparent to me how wide the gap is between the confidence of brilliant developers such as those in the Verus community and that of investors and not-so-technical community members, who have grown to feel most comfortable and confident with ol\u2019 trusty PoW. Closing this gap will take time and understanding of exactly how these innovations are designed and implemented.\nI hope this article can serve as a starting point in understanding and diving deeper into the genius of these innovations by Verus. Innovations which now put Proof of Stake on equal footing with Proof of Work, using the very same psychology and fundamentals, without sacrificing principle, cost, complexity or decentralization.\nFrom inception, Verus has been a trailblazer in the blockchain space, from the fair non-ico / no-premine launch, to the innovation of VerusHash, to the implementation of a 50/50 Stake/Mine +dPoW blockchain design, to the only project besides Zcash to be activating Sapling\u2026and now a simultaneous release of the most advanced and truly \u201cSomething at Stake\u201d PoS solution with no weak subjectivity.\nI\u2019m excited and proud to be involved with this community project and am busting at the seams with excitement over this incredible impending upgrade.\nAs technically sound and logically constructed as these innovations within Verus blockchain are, there\u2019s also the irresistible feeling of magic about it all. Especially when you see the talent of these developers demonstrated in solving the most pressing problems in Proof of Stake previously thought inherent.\nResources\nVerus Vision Paper\nVerus White Paper\nVerus Official Site\nIntroduction to Komodo\u2019s Crypto Conditions\nPocket Guide to Verus Coin\nAbout Sapling\nUnderstanding the Nothing at Stake Problem\nUnderstanding Weak Subjectivity\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: Consensus 2024\u200a\u2014\u200aVerus Showcases Fully Completed PBaaS Blockchain Technology\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/consensus-2024-verus-showcases-fully-completed-pbaas-blockchain-technology-0dba30607369\nContent:\n\nConsensus 2024 \u2014 Verus Showcases Fully Completed PBaaS Blockchain Technology\nVerus showcases its fully completed Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) technology at Consensus 2024, May 29\u201331, Austin, USA (booth 1245). The global event for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovations this year. Here, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency enthusiasts gather to explore the newest advancements in the industry.\n\nThe L0/1 Verus Protocol Solves Major Issues with Ethereum and Other VM-centric Networks\nDeveloping dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions. The Verus Protocol solves issues with gas fees, enables unlimited scale, is not vulnerable to smart contract hacks and bugs, addresses MEV at the protocol level, provides an identity model (VerusID) that applications can leverage and profit from, includes provable cross-chain and multichain support, does away with insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms, and does not require expensive Solidity developers for applications, unless they must also have an Ethereum component to them.\nAll these issues are solved with the L0/1 Verus Protocol. Verus does not use smart contracts \u2014 it uses smart transactions. Verus smart transactions [read more] are much easier to use (no programming needed) in practice to achieve most capabilities, if not all, compared to VM-protocols that use smart contracts. Yet Verus is still fully interoperable with Ethereum through the non-custodial, trustless and decentralized Verus-Ethereum Bridge with liquidity pool currency [more on the Bridge].\nShowcasing Verus App-Development Opportunities at Consensus 2024\nGet ready for a new era of decentralized application development. Unlike today\u2019s complex smart contract applications, requiring VM-based smart contracts that talk to user facing applications through server-side APIs and phishing-prone web-interfaces using public key hashes or rented names as identity, the Verus network is a Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 0 (L0) protocol with composable and powerful multi-chain core primitives, including identities, currencies, MEV-resistant liquidity baskets, updateable, even transferable ID-bound databases that can comprise NFTs and real world assets, all on a 100% fully decentralized, unlimited scale backbone, secured by the 50% proof-of-stake / 50% proof-of-work, 51% hash attack resistant Verus Proof of Power (PoP) consensus and accessible securely from mobile clients or cloud-based web-applications.\nBuild applications in your favorite framework for clients and access the Verus network either through QR-codes and deep-links to a client-side wallet under user control or talk directly to data-indexed, blockchain nodes, capable of providing fast access to an unlimited number of user identities and their unlimited Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF) indexable key-value database providing provable, optionally private, worldwide resolvable data at unlimited scale over an unlimited number of blockchains. All of this power, including inherent eCommerce and markets of all types are usable by applications, and unlike yesterday\u2019s Internet, application-owned data stays under application control, while user-owned data remains under user control and subject to voluntary, provable disclosure, protected by zero knowledge privacy, as it should always have been.\nWrite applications your way, your client frameworks, your languages, with links and RPC calls to the decentralized Internet of Value. Connect through one or more blockchains. Use, create, sell, and provision your application\u2019s permanent IDs for secure login, KYC, commerce, and provable data at scale, all on the rent-free, credibly neutral and fully decentralized Internet of Value.\nBuilders of applications, organizations, and businesses can use the Verus Protocol to provision IDs, manage and interact with users and user state at any scale, launch currencies (e.g. tokens, liquidity baskets [see docs]), even fully interoperable, independent, customizable worldwide blockchains with their own economics and fee structure, while sharing mining and economic power across the entire Verus Protocol network of unlimited PBaaS chains. All currencies, whether native currencies of a new blockchain, easily created and minted tokens, or MEV-resistant liquidity baskets are easy to launch and access with the protocol on Verus or any connected PBaaS chain. All of them, from the moment they are launched can be exported to Ethereum as ERC20s [see docs] or ERC721 currencies or any chain across the Verus ecosystem. All currencies on the network, including tokens, cross-chain currencies, and even liquidity baskets and their supplies are secured by miners and stakers according to protocol rules. On other blockchain networks, this level of security is applied to single native currencies, on Verus, all currencies on a chain are primitives known to and accounted for by the protocol, eliminating entire classes of smart contract risks that result when every contract reinvents a new way to account for its currency but has no systemic control.\nWith Verus, currencies are compatible with ERC20s. Verus applications can leverage, but do not require Solidity developers or VM-based programming. Additionally all ERC-20s can be permissionlessly bridged over from Ethereum to Verus [see docs], giving users and application builders the freedom to switch seamlessly between the Verus and Ethereum networks.\nAll currencies on the Verus network (also the ones bridged over from Ethereum) can be used with Verus DeFi, another primitive inherent to the protocol. Verus DeFi enables liquidity baskets of up to 10 underlying reserve currencies and can serve as a unique, self-balancing, MEV-resistant portfolio, a permissionless or permissioned ID registrar where fees go to the LPs of the basket, or an easy way to send from any reserve currency or the basket currency itself to any other without worrying about block builder reordering or MEV, as all conversions of a liquidity basket in any direction that are processed within one or more blocks are always solved simultaneously, no front and not back. Every conversion gets the same price in each direction with no spread and an ultra low fee (max. 0.05%), again, all part of the L1 consensus.\nWhether you plan to build eCommerce enabled supply chains, massively scalable ownership-based games, real world asset eCommerce enabled networks, voting systems, identity management networks, communication networks, financial networks, 3D metaverses with identities, brands, and ownership or just about any application for a better Web3 on the Internet of Value, you\u2019ll be left behind if you don\u2019t deep dive on Verus first.\nJoin us in the next crypto revolution.

And you can participate in its launch right now!\n\n\u23f1\ufe0f Verus-Ethereum Bridge launch: block height 2,758,800 (Fri 20 Oct, 2023).\n\u2705 Start preconverting to the bridge currency Bridge.vETH (with an initial supply of 100,000) NOW for a 10 day period. \ud83d\udc49 Connect to the bridge\n\ud83d\udc40 The first ever truly non-custodial, trustless and consensus proven cryptocurrency bridge. \ud83d\udc49 More here: https://docs.verus.io/eth-bridge/\nHow it Works\nYou can already start to preconvert VRSC, ETH, DAI and MKR into Bridge.vETH.\nBridge ETH, DAI and MKR over to the Verus network. \ud83d\udc49 Go to the bridge website How-to guide for bridging & preconversion\nPreconvert vETH (ETH), DAI.vETH (DAI), MKR.vETH (MKR) or VRSC into Bridge.vETH.\nSee Bridge.vETH statistics on verus.io/eth-bridge\nWhen the bridge currency launches on 20 Oct the initial supply of 100,000 will be distributed by the protocol among all preconverters.\n\nIf you move ETH, DAI and MKR over to the Verus blockchain before the bridge is launched your cross-chain fees are subsidized. Around 5000 VRSC is used to subsidize the fees on the Verus side. When the bridge currency gets launched, the VRSC that is left will be put into the reserves.\nDynamic Supply\nThe Bridge.vETH supply is dynamic (after the preconversion has finished and the bridge currency is launched). The currency gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, vETH, DAI.vETH and MKR.vETH, or gets burned when people convert out of it.\nAfter the bridge currency is launched you can convert into any direction.\nWorth noting: Verus DeFi is MEV-resistant. There is no front/back-running since all conversions are simultaneously solved within a block. More details on docs.verus.io\nThe Bridge.vETH currency function is to make the bridging of assets simple. From wherever you send it converts the fees that you need seamlessly.\nThe Bridge Accrues Fees\nThe bridge currency accrues fees with the cross-chain functions, conversions and .vETH VerusID registrations, making it more valuable the more it\u2019s used.\nDai holders get 5% interest (at the time of writing, the rate is subject to change by MakerDAO) automatically when holding in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. DAI in Bridge.vETH and in the complete Verus ecosystem get this savings rate. The DSR is being passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH.\n\nUse the Bridge\nAfter Bridge.vETH is launched and the initial supply is distributed you can now use the bridge as follows:\nConvert into any direction after the currency is launched and out of preconversion mode.\nExport launched currencies on Verus as an ERC-20. \ud83d\udc49 Learn how\nLaunch currencies on Verus that are 1:1 mapped to any ERC-20. \ud83d\udc49 Learn how\nSend currencies, tokens and liquidity pools cross-chain.\nSend ERC-721 & ERC-1155 NFTs to Verus, and export tokenized ID currencies from Verus to Ethereum as ERC-721 & ERC-1155.\nPresent Issues with Existing Cryptocurrency Bridges\nLet\u2019s first delve into the challenges associated with the prevailing cryptocurrency bridges in the industry.\nThe custody of bridged assets is typically maintained by a single or a small number of addresses, effectively creating a central authority for holding the funds, which contradicts the decentralized nature of blockchain.\nThe smart contracts that secure these bridged assets can be readily modified by a singular or limited number of authorities, thus presenting potential security issues.\nSmart contracts might contain bugs or malicious codes, making them susceptible to exploitation and undermining the safety of the bridged assets, especially if those assets are not accounted for by the block producers.\nThese problems have been demonstrated by numerous bridge hacks that have occurred and are likely to continue in the future. Verus does things, yet again, very different.\nWhy the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is Different\nThe Verus-Ethereum Bridge is different because the assets are never in anyone\u2019s custody. This is done through the seamless cooperation between the block producers, community notary witnesses, the Bridgekeeper software and the Ethereum smart contract. At each step during cross-chain transactions the assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent hacks.\nEvery 10 blocks validators create a notarization. They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum. The digital receipts, called \u201cnotarizations\u2019\u2019, contain, among other things: the \u201cstateroot\u201d (Merkle Mountain Range for Verus, Merkle Patricia Trie for Ethereum), the blockheight, blockhash and the gas price for Ethereum. The notarizations have to be agreed to by the block producers (miners and stakers) and are then mined into the Verus blockchain.\n\ud83d\udc49 Read more here on how the Verus Protocol handles cross-chain communication (PBaaS-chains and more) in a decentralized and provable way.\nSafeguards Against Bridge Hacks\nThreats caused by malicious notary witnesses, or stolen keys to drain funds are not viable against the Verus-Ethereum bridge. To successfully mount an attack on the bridge, if a majority of witnesses were colluding or got their private keys stolen the following would need to happen:\nColluding, malicious witnesses.\nFake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain.\nDevelopers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow chain.\nThese requirements are very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain. The bridge even provides a way to defend against such an unlikely scenario.\nThe notary witnesses are also monitoring notarizations, and if they were to sign for something that they themselves do not agree with, they can auto-revoke their identities, using the VerusID protocol, which cannot be stopped by an attacker unless they have stolen both the keys for the notary ID and those for its revocation ID as well. This serves as a prevention for stolen key attacks, ensuring that notaries are extremely hard targets to compromise.\nBridgekeeper\nThe two blockchains, Verus and Ethereum, are fundamentally different from each other, but still need to be able to communicate. A translator is needed. This translator is a program called Bridgekeeper. Notary witnesses have to run the program. Miners and stakers are also encouraged to run it, and for doing so they receive fees.\nBridgekeeper for CLI / How to become a Bridgekeeper \u2014 video\nVerus \u27a1\ufe0f Ethereum\nLet\u2019s consider a scenario where a user wants to move or convert assets from Verus to Ethereum. This transaction gets recorded on the Verus blockchain. When there are enough, or a certain time period has passed, these cross-chain transactions are rolled up into something called a \u2018CCE\u2019 (cross-chain export). This CCE is then added to a block by a miner or staker and they are rewarded a fee for doing so. The CCE is now officially part of the blockchain, and is linked to the \u201cstateroot\u201d (Merkle Mountain Range, which is an unchangeable overall summary of the blockchain at that block, and anything preceding it).\nMeanwhile, as the transactions (CCE) are being mined (or staked) in, the notarizations are also being mined or staked in, confirmed by miners and stakers, and only then, signed by the notary witnesses. The notarizations can occur as often as every 10 blocks, depending on how many miners and stakers are running Bridgekeeper. Before a notarization is used as proof, it has to be on the blockchain for 10 blocks, confirmed by another notarization, and also signed by at least 8 of 15 notary witnesses worldwide.\nThen when the notarization is confirmed on Verus, it\u2019s sent over to Ethereum and becomes pending on Ethereum. Once confirmed on Ethereum by receiving another notarization, the transactions (CCE) in that block are sent over to the Ethereum smart contract, along with the Merkle Mountain Range proof. If valid the assets are sent to the users Ethereum wallet.\nAnyone can roll up the transactions into a CCE and mine it in to get a reward, but also the notary witnesses paying the ETH fees to send it to Ethereum get a share of the fees to subsidize their transaction costs.\nIf there is no traffic from Verus to Ethereum, the notarizations are continued to be mined in on Verus but do not need to be sent to Ethereum, so when the traffic is light, there is minimal cost.\nEthereum \u27a1\ufe0f Verus\nThe above part explains going from Verus to Ethereum, but the other way around is actually a little bit different. It is not the notary witnesses that send the group of transactions over, but any miner and staker can, and thus also get part of the fees.\nNotarizations made on Verus always contain a stateroot from Ethereum that is a minimum of 30 blocks old (blocks on Ethereum take ~15 seconds) to make sure it is stable. Then after Verus has confirmed the notarization with a new one, Verus can accept transactions (CCE) from Ethereum, along with the Ethereum Merkle Patricia Trie proof that relates to the new confirmed data.\nA Giant Leap Forward\nThe delayed sending of transactions is an important security mechanism that is not present in any other cross-chain bridge. To recap: before any real transactions happen, the Verus network sends proofs to the Ethereum network and vice versa. These proofs are checked and agreed upon by everyone in the network. Only then the actual moving of assets happens. Because of this delayed system, no single entity ever gets control over the assets. Also there are safeguards in place for the community notaries that protect users from hacks.\nThis system is decentralized, which means it\u2019s controlled by everyone participating in the network, rather than a single central authority. It\u2019s a giant leap forward for the entire cryptocurrency industry, and everyone can be a part of it!\nJoin the community. Learn about the protocol.

This is part of the predictable and transparent monetary policy, set in place by its inception in May 2018.\n\nHalving Event\nThe current block reward is 12 VRSC \u2014 which means that miners and stakers who win a block are rewarded 12 VRSC for their efforts of securing the network. This number will go down to 6 VRSC, drastically lowering the number of coins coming into circulation. See the complete coin emission schedule here.\n\u2b50 What: Block reward to 6 VRSC\n\u23f1\ufe0f When: Block height 2,329,920 ( ~ Saturday 17 Dec 2022) see countdown\nIntroducing the Fee Pool\nWith the PBaaS-mainnet upgrade coming closer, let\u2019s introduce one of its gaming-changing features that will reward miners and stakers with drastically higher block rewards.\nHigher block rewards for miners and stakers.\nWhen PBaaS is activated on mainnet, anyone can launch blockchains, tokens and currencies, and they can convert currencies through Verus\u2019 L1 DeFi protocol. All these activities cost fees that directly go to the miners and stakers of the worldwide network.\nSo even though a halving to 6 VRSC might seem bad for miners and stakers at first glance, a lot of good things are on the horizon.\n\ud83d\udc49 Be on the cutting edge of blockchain technology and try out the fully functional testnet and its Fee Pool economy\nDiscuss and explore all Verus has to offer on Discord\nFollow on Twitter\nGo to verus.io\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: Verus Coin 0.4.0 Release Notes\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-coin-0-4-0-release-notes-e7eb35772bff\nContent:\n\nVerus Coin 0.4.0 Official Release Notes\n** OUTDATED Please Visit Verus Site for Latest Release ** \u2014 Sapling, Crypto-Conditions, StakeGuard (NoS CC Solution), Stake Delegation, GUI Enhancements\n\nTLDR: NEW In This Release\nVerus-enhanced Crypto-Conditions (CC)\nStakeGuard CC\nCatching Cheaters Using Stake Guard\nStake Delegation\nGUI Wallet Enhancements\nSapling Upgrade (activates at block 227520, ~Oct 30)\nSapling Zcash Proving Keys\nDownload Verus v0.4.0\nVerus v0.4.0 can be built from source or downloaded for your OS using the following links.\nThis is a mandatory update before October 30th. All clients must be updated before block 227520.\nDownload binary for your OS: \nhttps://veruscoin.io/#download\nor\nhttps://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.4.0\nBuild from source:\nhttps://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin\nIMPORTANT\nIF TWO OF YOUR MACHINES STAKE BLOCKS WITH THE SAME COINS, EACH ON A SEPARATE FORK, YOU CAN NOW LOSE YOUR BLOCK REWARD TO A CHEAT-CATCHER.\nStaking is now OFF by default to prevent unintentional multi-machine staking of the same wallet/address/coins. You can easily enable staking for the various editions of the wallet as follows.\nFor CLI \u201cverusd\u201d \u2014 Add the -mint parameter\nFor CLI \u201cverus\u201d command \u2014 Call the setgenerate true 0 command\nFor GUI \u2014 Click the Staking button\nOnly stake any given address or wallet on ONE COMPUTER AT A TIME, not more, as you risk losing your rewards due to the anti-cheat features of Verus 0.4.0+ blockchain. This does not apply to mining, you can still mine on as many machines as you\u2019d like.\nCrypto-Conditions and StakeGuard\nVerus 0.4.0+ now has a Verus-enhanced, Komodo crypto-condition technology, enabling smart transactions (similar to smart contracts but \u201con chain\u201d) and new types of on-chain functionalities. Verus has enhanced the original Crypto-Condition (CC) technology to make integration with standard transactions easier and enable advanced blockchain-level logic.\nThe first CC Verus has developed on-chain is StakeGuard, the Verus nothing-at-stake solution. StakeGuard works in conjunction with a newly modified signing script when staking and spending a reward. StakeGuard is where every Staking Transaction is processed. Legitimate Stake Reward spends are claimed by the staker. Cheated spends, proven to be cheats, are claimed by the cheat catcher (see below).\nIn later releases, the same technology will enable PBaaS, voting, identity capabilities, and more.\nCatching Cheaters\nStakeGuard, which supports the nothing at stake solution, includes the functions of catching cheaters in this version of Verus. Stake Guard enables every miner or staker to catch and spend block rewards associated with stake cheating (when someone stakes two blocks with the same coins on two or more forks).\nWith this early version of Stake Guard, all known orphaned stake transactions are compared to successful stakes when they mature. If the orphan was trying to stake the exact same coins but on a different fork and the real fork at the same time, the miner of the block at maturity of the cheat attempt (100 blocks after the cheat was made) will spend the cheaters one valid reward from the cheat attempt (the reward on the main chain), sending it to a sapling z-addr the miner or staker has set in their wallet. In other words, if, as a miner or staker, your wallet catches and spends such a cheat transaction, the reward for that coinbase will be automatically shielded to your sapling z-address at the same time as you win the block.\nThis early version of Stake Guard does not broadcast cheating transactions and it will not catch all possible cheats on the network. Future versions will excel at catching cheats on the network.\nAt this point with this release it is now statistically a losing proposition to cheat. In Verus 0.4.0+ you are now statistically more likely to generate more rewards by not cheating.\nStaking the same wallet/coins on more than one computer creates the possibility that you will stake on two forks with the same coins, which puts your earnings at risk as it can create \u201ccheated stakes\u201d, so you should not stake the same address/wallet on more than a single computer at any one time.\nLearn more about StakeGuard and Verus \u201cNothing at Stake\u201d solution here:\nHow Verus Solved Nothing at Stake and Weak Subjectivity Proof of Stake Problems\nFrom \u2018Nothing at Stake\u2019 to \u2018No Incentive to Cheat\u2019 \u2014 Innovating Proof of Stake on the Verus PoS+PoW Hybrid Blockchainmedium.com\nStake Delegation\nIn the new Verus network protocol that activates at the same time as Sapling, you can now set the parameter -pubkey in the command line wallet, which will redirect both mining AND staking rewards to the public key of an address, which can be obtained from an address with the \u201cvalidatekey\u201d command.\nVerus 0.4.0 GUI Improvements\nPerformance on large wallets is significantly improved\nSorting of all columns now works properly\nSeparate controls for mining and staking\nSapling Activation\nVerus Coin 0.4.0 includes support for Sapling addresses and transactions, including memory usage reduction of near 98% and performance improvements over previous z-transactions typically 40\u201350x.\nAs with Zcash Sapling upgrade rules, older \u201cSprout\u201d addresses and \u201cSapling\u201d addresses may not be mixed in the same transaction. That means if you have Verus Coin that you would like to move from an older Sprout z-address to a Sapling z-address, you must first send it to a transparent address, then to the Sapling z-address.\nSapling addresses can be used for shielding coinbase transactions or other functions. Retrieving viewing keys for Sapling addresses, which is not required for normal transactions, is not yet supported, and will be included in the next Sapling technology update.\nVerus will activate Sapling at Verus block height 227520. With each VerusCoin block approximately 60s, the estimated date for Sapling activation is October 30, 2018. Use the VerusCoin Explorer for the exact current block height.\nLearn more in-depth detail about Sapling here.\nNew Shielded Address Format & Improved Wallets\nA new address format introduces shorter shielded addresses which begin with \u201czs\u201d.\nSapling z-address format begins with \u201czs\u201d as in\nzs1z7rejlpsa98s2rrrfkwmaxu53e4ue0ulcrw0h4x5g8jl04tak0d3mm47vdtahatqrlkngh9sly\nThese new addresses can also be generated at scale within a wallet without computational cost, allowing enterprises and exchanges the flexibility of creating trillions of z-addresses in advance or on the fly.\nPerformance for New \u201czs\u201d Addresses\nShielded transactions with new zs addresses will utilize Saplings performance upgrades wherein payments can be constructed in a few seconds or even <1 second and use as little as 40 MB of memory. Shielded transactions are now possible on mobile or IoT devices.\nDecoupling Spend Authority\nSapling introduces split spending and proving keys. The spending key, used to sign transactions and generate a proving key, is now able to be stored independent of the proving key. The proving key, which handles the complex tasks can be on a separate or untrusted device without posing any risk.\nZcash Params\nNew Zcash parameters for Sapling will be downloaded, and are much smaller than earlier params.\nImproved Keys (coming soon)\nViewing keys now support incoming and outgoing transaction detail viewing for owners. An owner can view or share the new full viewing key with a trusted party without exposing their spending key and provide visibility to outbound transaction amounts, memos and target addresses.\n\nGet involved in Verus and the Verus community:\nVisit https://veruscoin.io\nResources\nHow Verus Solved Nothing at Stake and Weak Subjectivity for Proof of Work\nEverything You Need to Know About the Zcash Sapling Upgrade\nBen\u2019s Pocket Guide to VerusCoin for Dummies and Smart People\nKomodo Ecosystem Spotlight: Verus Coin\nKomodo AMA Spotlights VerusCoin\nFormation of The Verus Coin Foundation with a Vision of PBaaS\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: How Verus Tames the Wild Private Key\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-verus-tames-the-wild-private-key-3cc3b05c266\nContent:\n\nHow Verus Tames the Wild Private Key\nVerus ($VRSC) is an innovative, fast moving cryptocurrency project that has already completed an enormous amount of work and has some truly mind-blowing stuff live on mainnet and in development right now. What this article covers is only one of many new use cases. If you follow crypto and blockchain tech at all, you owe it yourself to dig deeper.\nMost of the features discussed in this article are already on mainnet \u2014 which means they\u2019re available for anyone to use. \u201cLocking\u201d and \u201cunlocking\u201d are on testnet and will roll out to mainnet in the not too distant future.\n\nIn pursuit of a better internet, Verus is making important changes to some cryptocurrency basics, improving on assumptions that have powered cryptocurrencies since Bitcoin launched in 2011. One ground-shaking example: with Verus, even if you lose private keys your money can still be protected.\nKeys and Addresses\nFirst, a note about public and private keys and cryptocurrency addresses. (You can skip this section if you\u2019re already familiar with them.)\nMost cryptocurrencies use a pairing of public and private keys to create their addresses. You use a string of numbers and letters derived from a public key to deposit funds. Though it\u2019s good practice to keep a public key secret, it doesn\u2019t have to be kept secret because it can\u2019t be used for withdrawals.\n\u00b7 An example Bitcoin address:\n1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2\n\u00b7 An example Ethereum address:\n 0x89205A3A3b2A69De6Dbf7f01ED13B2108B2c43e7\nPrivate keys, on the other hand, have the power to spend. After you send currency an address, it can be withdrawn by anyone who knows a corresponding private key. Private keys have to be kept secret.\nAn imperfect analogy for a private key is the password for an email account. If you know the password, you can login, delete everything and close the account. By the same token, anyone who knows the private keys for address can move its funds. One flaw with this analogy is that if you lose an email password you can change it. If you lose your private keys, however \u2014 or lose access to the wallet that\u2019s using them \u2014 you lose the funds they\u2019re associated with.\nProblems of key management \u2014 using keys as needed while also keeping them secret \u2014 have helped define the crypto landscape. If you save your private keys in an electronic medium, you risk getting hacked. If, on the other hand, you keep them on paper until you need them, they\u2019re protected from hackers but you might lose the paper. By some estimates, around 3.7 million Bitcoin have already been lost-\u2013billions of dollars worth at current prices\u2013a lot of it because private keys were misplaced: laundered, lost, shredded, forgotten, etc.\nRather than fuss with private keys, many people just leave their cryptocurrencies on an exchange. This goes against the decentralizing ethos of cryptocurrencies, but it\u2019s usually workable. When private keys for an exchange get hacked, however \u2014 which has happened many times \u2014 lots of money can be stolen very quickly.\nIt\u2019s been 11 years since Bitcoin launched: why are we still living like this? Why do private keys still have enough power to destroy a user\u2019s financial dreams? By placing the burdens of key management on individuals, cryptocurrencies harken back to the days of people shoving their savings into their mattress. If people are going to be responsible for their private keys, cryptocurrencies should include features that protect them.\nThere\u2019s a Better Way\nThis next section\u2019s a little geeky, but bear with it. What Verus has accomplished is big and worth understanding.\nVerus Self Sovereign Identity\nLike other crypto projects, Verus can use an address (with public and private keys) to send and receive funds. With Verus, however, you can also create a VerusID and use it to send and receive funds. This article is laser focused on features of the VerusID that you can use to protect your funds but VerusIDs are incredibly powerful and can be used as fully self sovereign identities.\nLike an email or web address, VerusIDs can include any combination of letters and numbers. They just have to end with an \u2018@\u2019 symbol. This document uses example addresses such as, Bob@, and Alice@\u2014 but Mogg@ could also be a VerusID, or BigCompany@, or BurgundySocksfortheHolidays@, or whatever.\nVerusIDs are controlled by one or more associated addresses. For example, if you send funds to an ID, they\u2019ll be available to be spent by that ID and also by associated addresses. As we\u2019ll see, this opens up a lot of design space.\nThe Three Authorities\nEach VerusID is created with three authorities. You can think of an authority as a bundle of specific powers.\nFirst is primary authority. Primary authority allows an ID to:\nreceive deposits,\nspend funds,\nsign,\nstake,\nmodify ID information,\nlock, and\nunlock.\n(We\u2019ll look more closely at those last two \u2014 lock and unlock \u2014 in a bit.)\nSecond is the revocation authority, typically assigned to another ID. The revocation authority revokes the primary authority. When used, it prevents an ID from spending or receiving funds, staking, signing, etc. For example, say you have two IDs, \u201cBob@\u201d and \u201cAlice@.\u201d If you assign Bob@\u2019s revocation authority to Alice@:\nAlice@ will be able to revoke Bob@\u2019s primary authority, making Bob@ unable to spend or receive funds, etc.\nOnly Alice@ will be able to change the revocation authority for Bob@; Bob@ will not be able to change it.\nFinally, there\u2019s the recovery authority. After it\u2019s assigned to an ID, the recovery authority can be used to recover a revoked primary authority, assigning it to a new address. The recovery authority can also change the recovery authority.\nSo, for example, say you assigned Alice@ to be the recovery authority for Bob@. If Bob@\u2019s private keys are stolen: After revoking Bob@\u2019s primary authority \u2014and effectively preventing Bob@ from spending or doing much of anything \u2014 the owner of Alice@ could recover Bob@\u2019s primary authority to a different address. Alice@ effectively swaps the addresses that control Bob@. The compromised private key becomes useless and Bob@ becomes fully functional and again with new, secret private keys.\nTogether, the primary authority, revocation authority, and recovery authority help Verus tame the wild power of the private key.\nExample, Part A\nSay Bob@ holds 1000 VRSC, and you want some protection in case Bob@\u2019s private key is lost or stolen. You decide to create a \u201cpaper wallet\u201d to hold an address for the Alice@ ID. Because that address was created in a paper wallet, it\u2019s never exposed to the internet. You give Alice@ both revocation and recovery authority over Bob@.\nNow you can continue to use Bob@ to deposit, to spend currency, to stake, etc. If you ever suspect it of being compromised, you:\nUse Alice@ to revoke Bob@s primary authority.\nCreate a new address.\nUse Alice@ to recover primary authority for Bob@ to the new address. Bob@ has changed his address \u2014 he\u2019s moved houses! His new address contains his 1000 VRSC. The robbery is foiled and all Bob@\u2019s funds are safe.\nWhat if Bob@ was compromised electronically though? Those 1000 VRSC can be spent very quickly. You might not have time to revoke and recover Bob@\u2019s primary authority. Other powers are needed.\nAccounting for Time\nThe Verus protocol allows an ID to be locked or unlocked. When locked, an ID can accept deposits, hold coins and even stake them (awesome), but it cannot spend them.\nHere are the possible \u201clock\u201d states for an ID:\nLocked indefinitely\nLocked and will unlock after\n1) an unlock has been requested and then\n2) a predetermined amount of time has elapsed\nUnlocked\nA VerusID can be in one of three states.\nWhen an ID is locked, its spending power can still be revoked. Revocation overrides locking. So, let\u2019s go back to our example and figure out how to really secure our funds.\nExample, Part B\nOnce again, Bob@ holds 1000 VRSC, but this time you can:\nAssign both revocation and recovery authority to the Alice@ address. (You could give revocation and recovery to different IDs, but for this example we\u2019ll put them both on the same one.)\nLock Bob@ with the condition that it won\u2019t unlock for 24 hours after unlocking is requested. Once you set a time, it can\u2019t be changed. It\u2019s protected by the blockchain.\nWith this design, you have complete a solution if a private key for Bob@ is compromised. Let\u2019s run through that scenario again.\nFirst, Bob@ is locked, so the attacker can\u2019t spend the 1000 VRSC. Instead, the attacker first has to request that Bob@ be unlocked. But you have cleverly configured Bob@ so it won\u2019t unlock until 24 hours after a request. You can use that time to safeguard your funds.\nUse Alice@ to revoke primary authority for Bob@. That prevents the attacker from withdrawing the funds.\nCreate a new address.\nUse Alice@ to recover primary authority to the new address. Bob@ is once again a functioning ID that you have primary authority over and that holds 1000 VRSC. You\u2019ve just swapped out a controlling address.\nThe attacker is now proud owner of private keys for an address that used to control Bob@ but now controls nothing.\nWhile this scenario tames the power of the private key, it also begs the question of how you know if an attacker has made an unlock request for Bob@? The answer is that requests are public \u2014 they\u2019re published on the blockchain. You can set an alert.\nIn Summary\nTwo big problems with private keys are 1) having them stolen and 2) losing them. Verus helps with both.\nTo Protect Against Theft\nAssign revocation and recovery authorities to an address that you can protect. For example, you might assign them to an address you created with a paper wallet. It won\u2019t be compromised electronically because it\u2019ll never have been on the network.\nLock the ID that\u2019s on the network and set a time period before it unlocks. If a request to unlock that ID appears on the blockchain, revoke the primary authority and recover it to a different ID.\nTo Protect Against Losing an ID\nAnd if you happen to lose the paper on which you wrote down your revocation and recovery ID, Verus can help with that too:\nFirst, request an unlock on the ID that holds your funds (the one that your revocation and recovery ID was protecting).\nWhile you\u2019re waiting for the unlock, create two additional IDs. (Say Bobby@ and Allison@.)\nWhen the coins unlock, send them to one of the new IDs (e.g., Bobby@). Then assign revocation and recovery for that ID to the other ID (e.g., assigned revocation and recovery for Bobby@ to Allison@). Your funds are usable and protected again.\nUI Versus Capability\nUsers may not want to think about concepts like \u2018authorities.\u2019 A user interface (UI), can provide instructions and clearly labeled controls that make authorities easy to use. The Verus community is already working on UI solutions. Maybe you should join us.\nThere\u2019s More\nTogether, VerusIDs and the three authorities improve and enable basic scenarios. But Verus is doing additional fundamental work at the protocol level. For example, you can assigned the three authorities to multiple IDs (e.g., five different IDs, or seven). Doing so can help with scenarios such as estate planning. Keep an eye out for articles on this and other scenarios.\n**\n\u00b7 There\u2019s a Verus channel on Medium with a lot more information about specific features.\n\u00b7 The Verus website is a fantastic resource.\n\u00b7 Join the conversation on Discord!\nVerus is a truly decentralized, *community* driven cryptocurrency project.

Skip down to Part 2!\nPart 1 \u2014 Jump in the Pool or Solo It..or Both?\nPool mining is a great way to participate in the distributed securing of a blockchain while earning rewards often sooner and more regularly than \u201csolo mining\u201d. Whether solo or pool mining however, ultimately the results should be about the same as far as coins earned.\nSolo Mining doesn\u2019t have to be \u201csolo\u201d either! You can split your computer power, mining solo AND pool simultaneously. Whether using just CPU power, or a combination of CPU and GPU, running the pool miner and Agama side by side is no problem.\nWhat Exactly is Pool Mining?\nIn pool mining, many workers are pooling computer resources and as a result, any rewards from blocks found by the pool are distributed fairly to all pool participants. If, for example, you had a pool with 24 miners and each contributed the exact same hash power to the pool, then when a block reward of 24 was won for a block found by the pool, each person would receive 1 coin.\nPool mining is the quickest way to get started mining Verus and earning VRSC. To learn how, check out my simple 5 minute quick start guide to CPU mining here:\nHow to Start CPU Mining Verus Coin VRSC from Your Computer in Under 5 Minutes\nA Dummies Step by Step Guide to Pool Mining Verus Coin with a CPU!medium.com\nAnd What\u2019s Solo Mining Again?\nIn solo mining, you run a fully synchronized node and mine the blockchain directly from your Verus wallet. This is also a really great way to help secure the network, becoming a fully synced node of the blockchain while mining\u2026and for any block found you get the full block reward. You may not find a block for a while, so rewards may be more sporadic, but a full 24 coins when you do win a block.\n\u201cDual Mining\u201d with Your CPU\nIf you use your CPU to \u201cdual mine\u201d pool and solo, simply \u201csplit\u201d your CPU thread power between the two. If your CPU has, say, 8 threads (common for a 4 Core CPU) you can assign 4 threads to Pool mining and 4 threads to Solo mining. While you should have the same earning potential either way (minus very small pool mining fees), this gives you the opportunity to earn a steady stream of VRSC and every once in a while get that \u201cbump\u201d of 24 coins in a single block mined from your solo miner.\nTo set up dual mining in this way, simply follow this guide for setting up the Solo side and then follow my 5 min quick start guide for setting up the Pool side\u2026making sure to assign the threads you want for each (if you split between just assign half to solo and half to pool).\nMining with Your CPU and GPU\nIf you have a modern and capable CPU AND GPU (for now that means Nvidia for GPU), you can mine using both of these hardware types simultaneously. You can split up your CPU power however you like, Pool mining only, Solo mining only, or both.\nYou can then loop your GPU into the party using the CCMiner available from Verus Discord community member Chris of LOUD Mining. The latest build is available at https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer/releases/tag/Verus2\nPart 2 \u2014 Setting Up Solo Mining with Verus Agama\nSolo mining with Verus enhanced Agama is extremely simple to get setup and started. It takes a little bit more time than setting up Pool mining because you\u2019re setting up a full node (Native mode) of Verus and syncing up the Verus blockchain.\nSolo mining is one of the best ways to participate in the decentralization and securing of the Verus blockchain and you earn VRSC for it! Also, by enabling Staking in the Verus Agama wallet, mined coins can begin earning you even more Verus Coin (after shielding and unshielding them, details in Part 4).\nOkay let\u2019s begin!\nStep 1\nDownload and unzip the portable Verus enhanced Agama for your OS at https://veruscoin.io/#download\nOpen Verus enhanced Agama and on the first screen, choose VRSC from the \u201cNative mode\u201d drop down and at the next screen, you\u2019ll see that the chain is loading\u2026and notice in the upper left it will say \u201cNative\u201d:\n\n\nStep 2\nWait for the chain to sync (you\u2019ll see a percentage in the blue loading bar) to 100%. Once synced up, a Mining button will appear just below \u201cTransactions History\u201d. Expand it and set the number of CPU threads you want to Solo mine with, then click \u201cStart mining\u201d:\n\nStep 3 (optional)\nYou can also click \u201cStart Staking\u201d if you\u2019d like to stake any VRSC balance. Keep in mind that if you make a copy of your wallet.dat file and use it on multiple Solo mining computers, you should only activate Staking on ONE of these iterations. If every Solo miner uses it\u2019s own, individual wallet, you can stake on each.\nBottom line: Only activate Staking ONCE PER WALLET or you will risk losing staked rewards, because Verus has solved the Nothing at Stake problem at the blockchain level, using Stake Guard and the decentralization of the network. You can read more here!\nStep 4\nYou are now Solo Mining! You can view your hash rate and stop the miner at any time using the buttons in Agama:\nScreenshot \u201cslightly\u201d modified for effect!\nNOTE: Verus Agama MUST REMAIN OPEN AND ONLINE to actively mine or stake\nStep 5\nVerus (Native Agama and CLI) creates a wallet.dat which is located in a hidden VRSC folder. This file should be kept SECURE and you should regularly BACK IT UP.\nThe wallet.dat file for VRSC is located in the following locations for various OS\u2019s:\nOn Windows: %AppData%\\Komodo\\VRSC \nOn Mac: ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Komodo/VRSC \nOn Linux: ~/.komodo/VRSC\nThis means your solo miner should be kept secure at all times. If you have a lot of trouble with managing your browsing activity, getting malware often, etc., you should NOT use that computer to mine. Make sure your mining rig is password secured, in a secure location or under your watch, and that your wallet.dat file is kept securely and regularly backed up. The entire VRSC folder will be impractical to backup, it\u2019s very large. So simply backup the wallet.dat file within.\nPart 3 \u2014 Importing Your \u201cLite mode\u201d Wallet to Agama Native\nIn case you started out with \u201cLite mode\u201d and now are running in Native, with a new wallet public address, you may want to import your Lite mode wallet to your Native wallet.\nStep 1\nIn the upper left of Verus Agama in Native mode, you\u2019ll see an \u201cImport key\u201d button, click this and a modal will appear. Simply enter the Seed used to create your \u201cLite mode\u201d wallet and click Import:\n\nWhen the import starts you\u2019ll see a message in the lower right and another when the import has successfully completed:\n\n\nSuccess! Your Lite mode wallet address is now a part of your wallet.dat file.\nPart 4 \u2014 Earn More VRSC by Staking Verus Coin!\nYou can also participate in Staking using the Native mode of the Verus wallet, activating staking by having a VRSC mature balance and starting Staking from the same Mining button in Agama.\nStaking is a great way to keep earning VRSC on your mined rewards or any VRSC you purchased on an exchange. For a balance in Verus to actively stake on the blockchain, it needs to be \u201cmature\u201d , in the form of a UTXO(s) and have at least 150 block confirmations as such.\nA newly mined or minted (won from staking) block will mature after 100 block confirmations (about 100 min). After reaching maturity, because it came from the coinbase, it needs to first be shielded and unshielded, which results in a UTXO (unspent transaction output).\nIf the VRSC in your wallet balance comes from someone else, is paid out from your pool mining efforts, or is from an exchange buy, it\u2019s already in UTXO format and will begin staking within 150 block confirmations of coming into your wallet (as long as Staking is enabled on the wallet).\nLet\u2019s talk about how to shield coins you mined from solo mining or minted from staking!\nStep 1\nGenerate a new shielded wallet address. This is a 1 time step, once you\u2019ve generated it, you can keep using it for future shielding/unshielding. To create your \u201czs\u201d address, in Verus Agama first click Receive, then click \u201cGet New Address\u201d and select \u201cPrivate Address (Sapling)\u201d. You\u2019ll see a confirmation in the lower right that it generated a new address.\n\n\nStep 2\nNow copy the new \u201czs\u201d address you generated by clicking the 3 vertical dots next to it and selecting \u201ccopy pub key\u201d. For easy access in the future, you may want to save this to a text file.\n\nStep 3\nNow you\u2019re ready to Shield your coinbase transactions\u2026the mined or minted coins. Click \u201cSend\u201d and select the option to \u201cShield all recent coinbase transactions\u201d. Then paste your \u201czs\u201d address in the \u201cSend To\u201d field and click \u201cShield Funds\u201d\u2026you\u2019ll come to a confirmation screen, check that your \u201czs\u201d address is correct and click \u201cConfirm\u201d:\n\nAfter a few seconds it will complete and you can click \u201cMake Another Transaction\u201d to return to the main Send screen.\nStep 4\nAfter the coins have been shielded and at least 1 confirmation reached on that transaction, you can Unshield them. To check confirmations, go to the \u201cTransactions\u201d screen and wait for at least 1 confirmation.\nNext, you\u2019re ready to Unshield. For this step, you\u2019re sending from a Private address, the \u201czs\u201d address you just shielded to\u2026to a Transparent address, where it will stake. Copy the Transparent address you want to use, from your \u201cReceive\u201d screen in Verus Agama by clicking the 3 vertical dots next to the Transparent (public) address where you want your staking balance to be\u2026and copy pub key.\nThen return to the \u201cSend\u201d screen and choose the \u201cSend from a private address\u201d option. Choose your private address with the balance you just shielded, paste your Transparent address (begins with \u201cR\u201d) into the \u201cSend To\u201d field and for Amount choose All (or an amount you want to unshield to a UTXO). Then click the Send button\u2026Confirm\u2026and you\u2019re set!\n\nYou can return to the Transactions screen to verify your new transparent balance and see the confirmations coming in\u2026after 150 confirmations your mature transparent balance, now in UTXO form, will be staking!\nJoin the Verus Community\nYou are now mining, helping secure the Verus blockchain, and earning VRSC!\nWhat next?\nBesides the incredible strong development, delivering cutting edge technology and ground breaking innovations (learn more about it here), Verus is a 100% community project and has a thriving and active Discord.

The Estonian-based exchange is listed on CoinMarketCap and presently has over $1MM in 24h trading volume, placing them just under the top 100 exchanges by volume, at 114th place (as of Oct 31, 2018). Follow STEX.com for updates and news related to their Exchange on Twitter.\nPlease note, STEX is a \u201cdot Com\u201d and is found at https://www.stex.com. There you can setup a free account and begin trading VRSC with BTC.\nThis listing is the second exchange listing for VerusCoin, not counting decentralized exchange BarterDEX. Verus is also listed and trading in BTC and KMD pairs on DigitalPrice. Thank you to the incredible, active Verus community for coming together so promptly to cast your \u201cvote\u201d in favor of this listing!\nAbout Verus\nVerus offers the most advanced zero knowledge privacy available, VerusHash, the only hash algorithm that is credibly mineable on both CPUs and GPUs, 50% proof of work and 50% proof of stake with a groundbreaking nothing-at-stake solution for more security and less power consumption, and is one of the most double-spend resistant blockchains running. Although Verus Coin has native, extreme double-spend resistance, it layers Komodo dPoW notarization for even further 51% attack resistance.\nThe Verus Coin project also releases a GUI, multi-coin wallet that allows the sending and receiving of private messages, has built-in CPU mining and staking, client and system improvements on a regular cadence, pool software, lite mode servers, and will soon release a multi-coin mobile wallet. The Verus Coin Project developers are currently working to add mobile staking, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), and polls and voting applications for scalable, public use. On top of all this, Verus was a 100% fair, no-ICO, no-pre-mine community launch.\nAn Important Listing at an Important Milestone\nThis listing comes on the heels of activating Sapling and implementing the new Crypto-Condition \u201cStake Guard\u201d which, in conjunction with Cheat Catcher, is a blockchain-level decentralized solution to \u201cNothing at Stake\u201d for Proof of Work. In addition to solving Nothing at Stake and Weak Subjectivity theoretical problems, Verus also notarizes to the Komodo blockchain through \u201cdelayed Proof of Work\u201d or dPoW. This notarization is similar to taking a snapshot backup of the Verus chain and \u201csaving it\u201d to the KMD blockchain. Komodo, in turn, notarizes to the most secure blockchain in the world\u2026presently Bitcoin.\nMilestones Being Realized\nOn October 30, at block height 227520, Verus activated an enhanced implementation of Sapling, the upgrade developed by Zcash. This upgrade changes how Shielded zk-SNARK transactions operate, introduces new address styles, and some additional advancements to Zero Knowledge privacy. To put it simply, the process of performing totally private zk-SNARK transactions, in new Sapling edition of Verus, is like going from Dial-up to Fiber overnight. Read more about Sapling here.\nIn addition to these important advancements, Verus also activated enhancements in how transactions are handled including the development of Verus\u2019 first Crypto-Condition called Stake Guard. Stake Guard is a decentralized solution to \u201cnothing at stake\u201d and \u201cweak subjectivity\u201d problems facing Proof of Stake, completely solving the problem by making it a losing proposition to cheat.\nAn important part of this solution is Cheat Catcher which can now be enabled on any node running in Native mode by either miners or stakers, and which will work in conjunction with Stake Guard to catch any found cheated block attempts and take the single legitimate reward the cheater would have had from the primary chain, giving it to the miner or staker who found the cheater instead. Read more about these innovations here.\nSeveral other important developments have also been implemented and released, in the latest Verus wallet, the Electrum Server and the Pool Software. Check out the latest Release Notes and Sapling Announcement to learn all about these exciting developments!\nSTEX.com Listing\nVerus is a community-driven project with an active, passionate, developer-rich community of supporters and participants.

Hold Pure to be exposed to both Verus and Bitcoin while accruing fees from conversions. Or use it to convert from tBTC to VRSC and vice versa.\n\n\u23f1\ufe0f Pure is launched on block: 2,975,703 (Sunday 24 March, 2024).\n\ud83d\udd01 Convert tBTC & VRSC to Pure, or vice versa. Or use Pure as an AMM and convert tBTC & VRSC with each other.\n\u2753 tBTC is BTC on the Ethereum network. Threshold.network supplies a decentralized bridge for users to bridge BTC to Ethereum. tBTC is also bridged to Verus (as tBTC.vETH).\n\u2328\ufe0f See the Pure statistics (protocol prices, amount in reserves) at Cryptodashboard or verus.trading. Or type in /pure in the #trading channel in the community Discord.\n\ud83d\udcda Learn in this article how to convert tBTC & VRSC with each other, and how to convert to and from Pure. Also you learn how to bridge tBTC to the Verus network.\nWhat is Pure?\nPure is a decentralized currency launched on the Verus blockchain. It is fully backed by its reserves: Verus (VRSC) and Bitcoin (tBTC), with a reserve ratio of 50/50%.\nThe currency is called Pure because it aligns with the true ideals of decentralization and transparency:\nBitcoin and Verus are fully decentralized and controlled by its nodes and block producers. No single entity or company controls them. They are not a business \u2014 they are rent-free protocols.\nBitcoin and Verus had fair launches. No ICO, no premine and no developer fees or taxes.\nBitcoin and Verus have a limited supply.\nBitcoin and Verus are censorship-resistant.\nHold Pure to be exposed to two decentralized cryptocurrencies upholding true cypherpunk values.\n\nPure is an AMM\nAnother benefit of holding Pure is that the currency accrues conversion fees. When users convert from Pure to VRSC or tBTC (or vice versa) they pay a conversion fee of 0.025%. When users convert between VRSC and tBTC they pay a conversion fee of 0.05%.\nHalf of those conversion fees (50%) stay in the Pure reserves, increasing the value of Pure since no new Pure is minted. The conversions are MEV-resistant and verified by the miners and stakers of the protocol. Learn more about Verus DeFi.\nConversions between VRSC and tBTC are only possible after the preconversion period has ended on Sunday 24 March, 2024.\nUsers can also create subIDs which cost 0.00021 tBTC.vETH (in Pure). These costs are burned reducing Pure in circulation. Learn more about VerusID and what you can do with it here. If users create an identity with your subID as referral, they pay 2/3 less \u2014 you get 1/3 and 1/3 is discounted.\nPreconversion period before the launch of Pure\nBefore Pure was fully launched, there was an 8-day preconversion period. In that period users could fund the reserves of Pure with VRSC and tBTC. During this period no conversions could be done. Depending on how much they added they got their fair share of 20,000 Pure after the 8 day period.\nThe initial supply of Pure was 20,000. After the initial supply has been distributed by the protocol, the supply became dynamic. When users convert from VRSC or tBTC into Pure, Pure is minted. When people convert from Pure back to VRSC or tBTC, the Pure is burned.\nLearn below how Pure was launched without any coding needed. Just a simple API call:\n\nWhat is tBTC, how do I get it & bridge it to Verus?\ntBTC is BTC on the Ethereum network. The decentralized bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum is supplied by the Threshold Network.\nExisting solutions that bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum require users to send their Bitcoin to an intermediary, in exchange for an ERC-20 token that represents the original asset. This centralized model requires you to trust a third party and is susceptible to censorship, threatening the premise of Bitcoin as sovereign, secure, permissionless digital asset.\nThe second generation of tBTC is a truly decentralized (and scalable) bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Every user who set up the secure VerusID Vault can now check its status from anywhere in the world.\n\nVerusID Vault: A secure place for your crypto assets\nVault is part of the VerusID self-sovereign identity protocol, built within the Verus multichain blockchain protocol. One of many VerusID features is that it functions as a human-readable cryptocurrency address. You can store $VRSC on your VerusID and lock them with Vault. In the future tokens and other bridged crypto-assets can also be stored and locked on a VerusID.\nA locked VerusID can not spend, which means assets can not leave your VerusID. Even if someone has the private keys. It\u2019s a revolutionary novel technology that will help many people from getting their crypto assets stolen. It can also be used for inheritance, trusts or vesting periods.\n$VRSC that is locked with Vault can still stake. You can create a setup for yourself in which you won\u2019t have to worry about your $VRSC being stolen.\nIn combination with other VerusIDs functioning as revocation and recovery authorities you can be a self-sovereign superpower. Having peace of mind and full control over your crypto assets is an incredibly powerful thing to have.\nRevocation and Recovery Authorities\nWhat if the private key of your VerusID is exposed? Maybe through your own fault, or a hacker that tries to steal your crypto assets. You don\u2019t want anyone to be able to run away with your hard-earned assets. You\u2019d want to be able to revoke access to that VerusID, so no one can do anything with the assets that are on it. And after that, you\u2019d want to completely recover those assets into your own control. Read more here on how the revocation and recovery authorities function.\nTimeLock & DelayLock\nVault has two different options to lock your assets, TimeLock and DelayLock. You can only choose one option to lock the Vault. And the only way to circumvent a locked Vault is through revoking and recovering the VerusID.\nWith TimeLock you determine how long you want the Vault to be locked. After the determined period is over the assets can be spent again. The maximum amount of time the Vault can be locked is 21 years.\nWith DelayLock you determine a cooldown period. You lock the Vault and have to request an unlock. After requesting the unlock you have to wait for the determined cooldown period before the assets can be spent again.\nVaultAlert.net\nSo how does it work? You can search for any VerusID on VaultAlert.net and it shows you all you need to know about the Vault status and more.\n\nLOCKED: the Vault is locked and funds can not be spent\nUNLOCK SOON: the Vault is locked but gets unlocked within a time period of 30 days.\nNO LOCK: Vault is not active and thus funds can be spent.\nDelayLock or TimeLock\nPrimary address: The primary address is the owner of the VerusID, as it contains the private key. It can contain more than one VerusID.\nIdentity address (also called i-address): The identity address is, next to the name, the identifier of the VerusID.\nRevocation and recovery VerusID authorities\n\ud83c\udf0e\u26a0\ufe0f\ud83d\udd12 Check out VaultAlert.net yourself with this example VerusID.\nBe a self-sovereign superpower\nIf you want to be at the forefront of Verus\u2019 cutting edge technology then you should not waste any time and get yourself a VerusID for a small fee (which goes to the miners and stakers of the network).

In this first vBasics-series, we explain what liquidity pools, automated market makers and fractional currencies are, and how they function in the Verus ecosystem.\n\nVerus is a foundational blockchain that builds key primitives at the consensus level of the protocol. DeFi is one of those key primitives, and quite difficult to wrap our heads around. Especially as the words we use can be confusing. This is new technology so we make it up as we go. DeFi systems we know use words like \u2018automated market makers\u2019 and \u2018liquidity pools\u2019. Verus adds \u2018fractional currency\u2019 to the terminology.\nIn a DeFi system there are no people you buy or sell your currency to. You only interact with a pool of liquidity. Inside this pool of liquidity can be many different currencies, small or large amounts. The liquidity pool is attached to a currency. The currency that is attached to the liquidity pool has a value that is determined by what is in the liquidity pool (image 1).\nImportant note: in the Verus ecosystem, all currencies with liquidity pools have adaptive supplies.\nImage 1: In Verus DeFi a currency can have a pool of liquidity attached to it\nLet\u2019s start by explaining currencies that are backed by 100% (see image 2). In our example we have NewCurrency. This currency is backed by 100% and has VRSC and ETH in its liquidity pool (A).\nIn a currency that is 100% backed, the value is always equally divided by the number of currencies in the liquidity pool. NewCurrency has 1000 VRSC and 2 ETH in its liquidity pool. And even though they are different values, and they have different values outside the Verus ecosystem, they still represent 50/50% of the value (B).\nLet\u2019s say the currencies in the liquidity pool of NewCurrency have a value of both $500. Consequently, the value of 1 NewCurrency is $1000 (C).\nImage 2: How the value of a Verus DeFi currency is composed\nSo, depending on what is in the liquidity pool of NewCurrency, the price of the currency fluctuates. Here comes the term \u2018automated market maker\u2019 in play. No person sets the price of the currency, it is fully automated. Anyone at any time can interact with this currency because there is always a value, and always liquidity. Which means it is an always \u2018on\u2019 market maker. A fully automated market maker.\nYou might ask yourself: why is there always liquidity? This is because a liquidity pool can never be really empty. One can always add or take out VRSC and ETH. When a balance tips too much to one side, there is opportunity to arbitrage and make money. There is always something to trade against.\nNow why would someone want to convert their VRSC or ETH to NewCurrency? This is a portfolio management choice. NewCurrency acts as a constant-mix strategy. You are exposed to two different currencies, while holding only one. By holding NewCurrency you also earn fees from people converting, more on this later.\nA Verus DeFi currency that is backed by 100% can have many more currencies than just two in its liquidity pool. All kinds of combinations are possible (image 3).\nImage 3: A currency backed by 100% can have many different currencies in its liquidity pool\nIn the Verus ecosystem we call a currency that has a pool of liquidity attached to it a \u2018fractional currency\u2019. The currencies that are in the pool of liquidity we call \u2018reserve currencies\u2019, see image 4.\nImage 4: Verus DeFi terminology\nTo make it a bit more complicated, let us explain why we call these currencies \u2018fractional currencies\u2019. In our example before (image 2) we showed a fractional currency that derives its value 100% from the reserve currencies: it is backed 100%. In the Verus ecosystem, we can have fractional currencies that are partially, fractionally, backed by a number between 5 and 95%, see image 5.\nImage 5: Two examples of fractional currencies that are partially backed by its reserves\nHow one creates 100% backed or partially backed fractional currencies differs. A user can create a currency and define that the currency is 100% backed. A user can not define the fraction between 5 and 95%. The number of backing by a fractional currency is dependent upon market forces before the currency is launched.\nOne can ask, what is the consequence that a currency is backed by 10, 50, 80 or 100%? The difference is the curve of price vs supply. And remember, the fractional currencies have adaptive supplies. See image 6 for a simplified illustration.\nImage 6: Different backing percentage means different price vs supply curve\nConverting From Reserve to Reserve\nWe have explained how one can always convert to a fractional currency with its reserve currencies. Or back to a reserve currency with the fractional currency. In the Verus ecosystem there is another way to convert currencies.\nWe call this converting through the fractional currency. One doesn\u2019t acquire the fractional currency, but converts through the fractional currency to a reserve currency. To simplify: one converts one reserve currency to another reserve currency. See image 7 for the different conversion possibilities within our NewCurrency example. Remember that all the currencies (fractional & reserves) have a value relative to each other.\nImage 7: Possibility to convert in every direction\nFor example, if one owns VRSC, they can convert it to ETH through NewCurrency. In the Verus DeFi ecosystem, if one wants to convert VRSC to ETH, the protocol searches through all the fractional currencies with both VRSC and ETH in its reserves, presenting you the best price for conversion (image 8).\nImage 8: The protocol searches through all fractional currencies to present the best conversion price\nThere is always a value, and always liquidity attached to the fractional and reserve currencies. It will always be possible to obtain a fractional currency, or convert to a reserve currency with any of the many fractional AND reserve currencies that will be available in the Verus ecosystem.\nImportant note: all fractional currencies on the Verus blockchain must have VRSC as one of its reserves.\nEarning Fees\nLike we discussed earlier, holding a fractional currency is besides a portfolio/investment strategy, an opportunity to earn fees.\nLet's say one holds NewCurrency from image 2. Every time a user converts VRSC to ETH, or ETH to VRSC, 0.025% of the transaction in VRSC stays in the NewCurrency reserve. This means that the total value of NewCurrency goes up which is beneficial for the holder.\nJoin the Revolution\nWhat makes Verus unique compared to its competitor Ethereum, is that in Verus all blocks are solved simultaneously. Front-running will not be possible. Read more in-depth information on the differences between Verus and Ethereum DeFi.\nA giant system of liquidity will emerge, with value flowing in every other direction. Many times the value of the currencies in the Verus ecosystem will not be aligned with the same currencies outside of the ecosystem. Many arbitrage opportunities will arise which means more value flowing into the system.\nEssentials\nVerus Website\nGet Verus Desktop\nMining Software & Pools\nGitHub Repository\nBlock Explorer\nCoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, CoinPaprika\nJoin the Verus Community\nOfficial Twitter\nDiscord\nCommunity Telegram\nFacebook\nMedium\nReddit\nBitcoinTalk\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: January 2022\u200a\u2014\u200aVerus Monthly Recap\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/january-2022-verus-monthly-recap-3f5087dadabc\nContent:\n\nJanuary 2022 \u2014 Verus Monthly Recap\nThe latest Verus updates on development, community, ecosystem and more.

VerusID Vault always protects your crypto assets even if your private keys are compromised. Read more on VaultAlert here.\n\nLast month a lot of quiet progress was made on the development of the Verus multichain protocol. A new public testnet is on the verge of release with additional core protocol features. All effort is put into making Verus a decentralized and robust protocol that just works.\nExporting Currencies\nCurrencies on one PBaaS-blockchain can be exported to any other PBaaS-blockchain. This means that a currency can easily be made available on multiple blockchains.\nAn example: we have CHICKEN-currency on a PBaaS-chain and want it to be available on the Verus-blockchain as well. We export CHICKEN-currency to the Verus-blockchain for a fee and now CHICKEN-currency is available there too. It goes without saying that all fees go to the miners and stakers of the network.\nWe can pay this fee in whatever currency we want, as long as it is available in the bridge-converter.\nThis fee is defined by the PBaaS-chain where you want the currency to be exported to, and thus can differ within all the multiple blockchains in the network.\nFee Structures\nOn the previous public testnet you could only make transactions if you had the native currency of the blockchain. Now you can use any currency that is in the bridge-converter as a fee to do operations on any PBaaS-blockchain.\nAny currency on a blockchain can be used as fees to do transactions. Example: if you have USDC on the Verus-blockchain you don\u2019t need VRSC to send the USDC around. It automatically converts a small fee of USDC to VRSC through a bridge-converter and uses that as its transaction fee.\nThis is an incredibly hard problem to solve. Yet it is working now on internal Verus test builds.\n\n\ud83d\udd0a Public Technical Updates from Mike Toutonghi\nOn January 8, 2022, Mike Toutonghi gave the community technical updates on the Verus Discord channel. \ud83d\udd0a You can listen to it here.\nAwesome Mining Rigs\nSome community members have shown their mining rigs in the #mining channel on Discord this month.

In addition to strong encryption, Verus private messaging shields the receiver\u2019s address, and optionally the sender, with the same zero knowledge technology (zk-SNARKs) used in private transactions.\nThe new Verus Coin release also aims to improve Verus network decentralization and performance at scale, while reducing network lag. As a result, it will boost mining and staking efficiency for miners who may have experienced network synchronization delays due to the multiple terahash growth of the Verus network with solo CPU mining in only a matter of days. The Verus Foundation has incorporated learning from the recent network growth to improve performance and optimize network and individual efficiency for the entire Verus community.\nAccording to Michael Toutonghi, lead developer:\n\u201cWe certainly hoped for the kind of network growth we are seeing, and with that growth, we can learn, optimize and tune the Verus network parameters to prepare for geoscale usage by large populations. We are also working hard with a number of pool operators to bring Verus pools online, which will further strengthen the network and allow people worldwide to mine Verus in smaller amounts, while receiving payouts on a more regular basis.\u201d\nWhile there are numerous new features, the new Verus wallet release focused on two primary objectives:\nOptimized network performance\nAs the Verus network has grown rapidly in its early weeks and months of operation, some community users began reporting a lack of available connections into the Verus peer to peer network, resulting in synchronization lags. This release changes the ratio of available connections to their consumers quite significantly on the network. It also includes anti-lag measures to further ensure that the software is spending its time efficiently.\nEasier private, encrypted, notarized messages and improved GUI\nThe 0.3.11 software release enabled attaching a private encrypted memo when sending to a private z-address, but there has not been an easy way to view these messages in either the GUI or on the command line. The 0.3.12 release now adds all incoming private transactions to the transaction display and enables receipt and decoding of private encrypted memos.\nVersion 0.3.12 of the Verus Coin software is a step forward towards realizing the Verus Vision of Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) powering public applications, such as polling, voting, and decentralized identity.\nContact:\nVerus Coin Foundation: foundationrelease@veruscoin.io\nVisit the Website for software and white papers: https://veruscoin.io\nFollow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/VerusCoin\nSubscribe on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/VerusCoin/\nChat on Discord: https://discord.gg/MPXXJCm\nRepresentatives on Discord: miketout, englal, michaeltoutjr, VirtualSoundNW, Asher, crypto05\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: Verus Announces New Multicurrency, Multichain DeFi Protocols and Immediate Public Availability of\u2026\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-announces-new-multicurrency-multichain-defi-protocols-and-immediate-public-availability-of-f1868f259ce5\nContent:\n\nVerus Announces New Multicurrency, Multichain DeFi Protocols and Immediate Public Availability of Fully Functional, Multichain Testnet\nWithout any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite.

The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all today.\nCapabilities which to our knowledge are not available on any other decentralized platform today\nAs Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today\u2019s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.\nThe Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or CLI wallets as VRSCTEST, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are not available on any other decentralized platform today.\n1. Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) with zero-knowledge privacy support (VerusID) \u2014 Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.\nThe Verus network and all PBaaS chains also support zk-SNARK, zero-knowledge privacy for private transactions and messages. When combined with VerusID, Verus becomes the only blockchain network in the world with zero knowledge privacy with friendly-name IDs.\n2. Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault) \u2014 Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds.\nWhen locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user\u2019s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.\n3. Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming \u2014 Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it.\nAll PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n4. Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets \u2014 Enables any ID owner to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%.\nThe Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners, stakers, and liquidity providers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n5. Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches \u2014 Enables the launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain.\nBridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n6. Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge) \u2014 Enables you to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your currency, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get their pre-conversions (minus network fees) refunded.\nThe launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n7. An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale \u2014 Allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with seamless, secure sending of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n8. Merge mining of up to 22 blockchains simultaneously \u2014 Lets you multiply your hashpower by up to 22x by mining multiple chains at the same time, on the same hashpower.\nVerus has no limit on the number of simultaneously running blockchains across its multi-chain network, and rather than requiring more and more hash power and energy to process the scale of transactions that can be supported across all of these chains, Verus makes merge mining up to 22 blockchains easy and automatic by individuals or even pools.\nYou can discover and select your favorite projects from across the Verus network using the Verus Desktop, and mine them all, effectively multiplying your hashpower by up to 22x. Start your own project and pay some of your costs by mining other currencies as you mine your own. Each blockchain continues to run on its own independent worldwide network, yet you could make your choices to earn rewards on all or some of the blockchains and participate in their cross-chain operation. Together, Verus automatic merge mining and its 50% proof of stake, 51% hash attack resistant algorithm makes runaway energy costs for crypto mining and transaction processing a thing of the past.\n9. Blockchain fee pools and anti-front running \u2014 Addresses MEV and more elegantly solves the EIP1559 problem with a block reward independent economy.\nAs DeFi protocols become the new \u201ckiller apps\u201d for blockchain, soon to be joined by identity and future NFT models, fees earned by miners and stakers in a block can now often exceed block rewards. This is a natural outcome of blockchains being used for commerce and was a consideration of Satoshi\u2019s as the rewards that would replace block rewards over time.\nWhen DeFi protocols, VM-based applications, or other functions earning fees are completely separate from the blockchain consensus protocol, as is the case in Ethereum and most other VM-centric systems, miners and stakers often have perverse incentives to reorg the blockchain and capture the blocks with unusually large fees, even after they have been mined by another. The Verus developers consider this a fundamental security flaw in the consensus protocol and are introducing the Verus Fee Pool, which will be operable on all PBaaS chains as well.\nThe Verus fee pool is a complete solution to enabling a blockchain economy and works by simply requiring that miners put all fees into the fee pool and then take a fraction of the fee pool as their fee reward. This way, it is always more efficient to continue mining forward, as any large sum of fees will be distributed with exponential decay over the current and future blocks. In addition to the Verus Fee Pool, fees for conversions may be paid in the source currency and are automatically converted to Verus or the native blockchain currency on a PBaaS chain before being exposed to miners as transaction fees, providing an entirely new and complete solution to both the problems of large fee disruptions and integration of DeFi conversions into the consensus security protocol.\nWritten by miketout & michaeltoutjr\nJoin the New Era of Crypto\nDiscuss and share ideas on your own blockchain or currency project, or if you need help come to our Discord server.

The idea has been around for a while since ERC-20s mainstreamed the idea of token creation riding on top of a base layer blockchain. Creating digital scarcity and expressing that as a transferable token was now possible without creating an independent blockchain; it could be done at relatively low cost and with low maintenance. Soon, people began thinking about tokens where an influencer, brand or community creates a branded token, pre-mines a little bit of it, gets their fan-base/customers/community to transact in it and, presto, the token will start to gain a little bit of value.\nThe First Generation\nEarly market leaders soon arrived, such as tryroll.com and rally.io. These platforms are well-funded venture businesses that managed to onboard perhaps thousands of creators into their own social tokens. Despite some fanfare though, there\u2019s not much to these tokens other than\nenforced digital scarcity \u2014 they help creators create and issue ERC-20s (or Solana now, for Rally), helping them through what is an otherwise arduous process requiring some skill\nautomated market making \u2014 they help set up Uniswap-like liquidity provision, but to gain actual liquidity creators must, in the words of the Roll website: \u201cencourage their communities to contribute liquidity\u201d\nhanding creators a roadmap and examples to \u201cbuild value\u201d \u2014 this generally involves activities, services or products that creators will offer to their fans so that they can get their communities to buy the token and then trade the token for these goods \u2014 the idea is to generate real-world demand for the tokens\nOn the roll website, this last concept is pitched as: \u201cAfter minting, you determine all the ways your token will be distributed and used across platforms, closing the loop that gives your social token its own independent value and starts your social token economy.\u201d. But, as described in this article, \u201cI discovered that it\u2019s just a sh**tload of work to keep a token going\u201d.\nThe end result is that value in social tokens remains fleeting or aspirational. Liquidity through liquidity provision in automated market makers can be a big problem. For a liquidity provider, risks are high, probably untenable since impermanent loss risk in an AMM with a fragile token approaches 100%. It turns out that liquidity provision in this context is a wholly altruistic activity, or worse, done by people who are unaware of the enormous risks. WIth minimal liquidity provision comes little market depth and unstable value.\nAlso, value for the token is tightly locked to a creator\u2019s ongoing real world efforts to provide experiences, or events, or products, in order to drive continuous demand for the currency. There are no automated economic activities. If the creator\u2019s activity stalls, or dries up, the token will lose value rapidly. Predictably, the vast bulk of these currencies peter out, and are forgotten, living on as zombie ERC-20s on ethereum.\nNo Long Tail\nAnyone that\u2019s really interested in creating a social token is met with an odd reality in the \u201cdecentralized\u201d blockchain world. Both Roll and Rally, the social token leaders, require creators to go through a detailed application process, and then wait for approval. The Rally website says they\u2019re looking for: \u201c1) Evidence of a significant community size, \u2026 2) Evidence of current transaction activity within your community \u2026 3) Evidence that you have strongly considered the role that a social token economy would play in your ongoing projects.\u201d Creators then wait for a review before being approved. Roll\u2019s business model is to take a portion of the creator\u2019s token for themselves. Rally\u2019s is a little more sophisticated, attempting to have value created in their own token and sidechain in the process.\nThis makes sense for Roll and Rally because there is significant engineering and other work required to get the contracts up and running that define the social token and provide it liquidity. Creators who want to \u201cdo it themselves\u201d are met with an arduous and limiting process \u2014 essentially, they need to be decent developers to get their tokens going. And to do all that for a one-dimensional token that can only be sent back and forth or placed in an AMM seems to be an unattractive proposition.\nThe result is that social tokens have yet to fulfill their promise. There\u2019s no easy way for just anyone to do permissionless experiments at little cost, and little risk. And, when they do experiment, there is only the hope that by tying real world activities to their token, they might generate some value there, at least while they continue to offer those activities. This purported value is difficult to measure, and tough to capture, and exhausting to maintain. So there\u2019s no real innovation and no \u201clong tail\u201d that allows unexpected modes of organization and value creation to emerge.\nNew Capabilities\nWhat would it look like if there were new capabilities around social tokens? What are some of these, and how would they function?\nEasy launch \u2014 low cost, permissionless, easy launch through point and click or simple commands. This would lower barriers and allow for just anyone to try out social token experiments. The law of large numbers tells us that some would stumble into real success, perhaps in ways, and through methods, we don\u2019t yet understand.\nBuilt-in Direct Liquidity \u2014 five years ago, the Bancor project pioneered smart tokens, which they called \u201cmoney that holds money\u201d. Bancor seems to have abandoned this concept in favor of competing with Uniswap, but the idea has real merit. A social token with this property would not need an automated marketmaker to be able to be a liquid token. Instead, users could convert into and out of the token directly, after first being \u201cseeded\u201d by the founder. This eliminates liquidity provider risk \u2014 and, in essence, every single holder of the token ends up providing liquidity, automatically. This leads to more market depth, and thus more stability and predictability in value. The fact that each token is \u201cmoney that holds money\u201d leads to provable value, and these tokens will be treated with care, as near money. Another result of this capability is that social tokens would have dynamic supply, where more tokens are automatically minted in response to increasing demand, and burned if the demand reverses.\nAttached Namespaces \u2014 tokens have names, of course. If these are cryptographically unique names (like, for example, crypto addresses), they can be the root of a namespace. ERC-20 names are not unique and so cannot be namespace roots (unless referred to by their contract number). A different model for tokens, where their friendly names are defined in the protocol and processed as UTXOs just like native blockchain currency, points to whole new capabilities. For example, if someone called \u201cInfluencer\u201d creates a social token called \u201cInfluencer\u201d, they will have also defined a namespace called \u201cInfluencer\u201d, opening up unique digital goods opportunities.\nDigital Goods \u2014 a namespace on a blockchain protocol renders unique power; a simple model for digital goods on a namespace would include:\nobject definition \u2014 a protocol could allow unique friendly name identifiers within the namespace, meaning fans could register identities/names that are associated with the namespace, eg. \u201cfan.influencer@\u201d, or an influencer could assign meaningful names to digital goods attached to their namespace, eg. \u201cticket0001.influencer@\u201d or \u201ccoolnft.influencer@\u201d or \u201cschedule.influencer@\u201d\nobject control and transferability \u2014 a protocol could allow defined objects to be controlled by private keys and to be transferable from one set of private keys to another, either by command, or in an atomic swap transaction, eg. fans could transfer their objects to and from each other at will, or on automated marketplaces without intermediaries\nobjects as destinations/addresses/endpoints \u2014 as addresses on a blockchain protocol, these objects could receive, send and hold funds, or control other objects; eg. money could be sent to or from \u201cfan.influencer@\u201d; also, objects could be endpoints, and so could receive messages or be unique points in a communications network\nobject metadata \u2014 objects could contain space for metadata, and leverage data structures and off-chain storage (either centralized or decentralized, like arweave) to allow for arbitrary and updateable data to be associated with the object. Coupled with #3 above this allows objects to exist as NFT art, or verifiable online profiles\nobject signatures \u2014 being cryptographically unique, objects could provide verifiable signatures to arbitrary data, thus allowing for applications like sign-on/access, or voting\nImmediately we see that meaningful digital goods economies could spring up around successful influencers. Examples of such digital goods would be:\nFan IDs \u2014 the simple act of creating a fan ID/address for just a few dollars could be seen as a show of support, or status symbol in an influencer community; or fans could create and trade meaningful IDs\nNfts \u2014 influencers, or even their fans, could create digital collectibles/art/memorabilia to be auctioned, sold or given away to fans\nFan Profiles \u2014 updateable, verifiable fan profiles are possible\nTicket \u2014 an object could represent a ticket to an event\nCoupons/gift cards \u2014 an object could represent a right to buy merch\nDiscount Codes \u2014 an object might give a right to get ongoing discounts on merch or events\nMemberships \u2014 an object can provide exclusive membership to influencer clubs or forums\nLog-in/access \u2014 an object can give rights to enter websites or other digital arenas\nVoting \u2014 objects could be used to signal support for an initiative, idea or proposal\nThis is far from an exhaustive list, and the \u201clong tail\u201d will surely draw out ideas which we\u2019re not even capable of conceiving right now. Many of these goods would be automatic or community created and so could thrive even without continuous activity from the issuer. This is important for the longevity of the social token economy. It\u2019s not difficult to see how strong community-created activity could thrive and persist.\nAn Economic Model for the Digital Goods \u2014 to capture value for the issuing influencer (and others), there is no necessity ever to sell tokens directly to the public (which might bring securities laws into the issue anyway). The social tokens would always be just a commodity/good/coupon that can be acquired to show support, or to be used (exclusively) to acquire digital goods like those described above. An issuer would always, likely, issue \u201cfree\u201d tokens to themself as part of the creation process (a \u201cpremine\u201d), or retain the right to issue new tokens at will (perhaps only after the passing of a period of time). They would also need to \u201cseed\u201d the token with a little bit of real world money to provide initial value to the token. Note that this seed money would never actually be at risk of loss, and could always be recovered; in fact, recovery (and more) would be quite easy in the case of thriving token economies. Once this is done, then fans could acquire the tokens (directly, without an AMM) by converting their currency, like USDC, into the social token. Every time a fan does this, they increase the supply of the token a little bit, and they also drive up its value. When they spend the token on digital goods (like ID creation, buying a NFT, getting a membership, etc.) the amount that they spend gets burned from the supply of the token, which reduces its supply and further drives up its value. During this process, too, the robustness of the reserves of \u201creal\u201d currency are improved, providing more depth and stability to the token\u2019s value. It will become easier and easier for the issuer to start selling down their \u201cpremine\u201d, or to issue themself new tokens, and thus capturing the created value, without crashing the value of the token.\nWith this model, further value enhancement might come from speculators who see that an influencer is growing in power. Speculators like these would be analogous to collectors who have an eye for talent, and that can spot trends. All they need to do to profit is to get in early on the right tokens by the right influencers with the right potential economic activity that would *inevitably* drive value increases. In this way, market dynamics might allow influencers to capture future value today.\nThis Exists Today \u2014 the Verus Project\nThis is not just theory, but is about to be put into practice. Five years in development, and with a working network (minus these token capabilities) for the last three years, the Verus Project has built the protocols. Verus aims to be a public good. There are no VCs funding the project and so no returns on investment that need to be drawn from users to pay back investors. It is a community developed FOSS blockchain protocol. The only fees involved in creating and using social tokens on Verus will be paid, as in bitcoin, to miners who power the network.\nThese capabilities as described do not exist on smart contract platforms today. Perhaps they could be engineered on a case by case basis by a team of competent smart contract developers. But, this would require complex interconnecting smart contracts to deal with all of the disparate elements. It would be an enormous engineering effort, fraught with risk and complexity. On Verus, using primitives as building blocks, these tokens can be issued in just a few minutes, with bespoke variables, by non-programmers, and at little cost.\nAdditional Capabilities\nApart from the core functionality of social tokens described above, there are also some interesting capabilities that enhance the concept. First, as a fork of zcash, Verus offers private transactions on its native currency. And, as a UTXO blockchain, wallets control multiple addresses which cannot necessarily be traced to the same wallet. This gives the ability for intelligent apps to protect user\u2019s privacy as they interact with social tokens.\nAlso, on-chain escrow mechanisms allow for issuers to timelock their holdings for arbitrary periods. This helps reduce potential moral hazard where fans and speculators might be concerned about issuers dumping their holdings and \u201crugging\u201d their community. Roll has always been concerned about this possibility, and that led them to provide centralized escrow services for their issuers. Unfortunately, a security incident at Roll led to these \u201cescrowed\u201d amounts being stolen and liquidated.\nSocial tokens might be tied to entire groups, rather than a single influencer. In this case, Verus protocols allow multisignature approvals for the issuance or sale of the tokens. Multisigs can be up to 13 of 25 different participants.\nFinally, Verus testnet currently includes a provable decentralized bridge to and from the ethereum network. This bridge allows any token created on the Verus network to be bridged to ethereum, where it *automatically* emerges as an ERC-20 token, without any additional programming required. This is a crucial element, as ethereum is currently where the users are. Once created on Verus, an influencer can bridge tokens over to ethereum, where it can be used for giveaways, liquidity provision, or any other purpose for which social tokens are used today by Roll or Rally. Similarly, tokens can be bridged from ethereum, meaning that USDC, ETH, WBTC and other valuable currencies will exist on the Verus mainnet.\nStatus\nThese protocols exist now on the Verus testnet and are scheduled for imminent release to the Verus main network. As a community project, and FOSS project focused on core protocol development as a public good, Verus community members have not yet advanced consumer-ready tooling and apps that can take full advantage of these core capabilities. Nevertheless, forward-thinking influencers can start now, since experimentation is inexpensive, permissionless and easy, and some of the tooling and apps do exist for capable users. More importantly though, there is a business opportunity here for companies or entrepreneurs to leapfrog Roll and Rally, or for those companies themselves to pivot to, or supplement their current offerings with, a more capable rent-free platform. The Verus community stands by to assist anyone who would develop tools and applications and businesses leveraging the protocols.\nDiscuss and explore all Verus has to offer on Discord\nFollow on Twitter\nGo to verus.io\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: August 2021\u2014 Verus Monthly Recap\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/august-2021-verus-monthly-recap-4241c7c80b8a\nContent:\n\nAugust 2021\u2014 Verus Monthly Recap\nFilling the information gap. Subscribe to the newsletter. This is for you who doesn\u2019t want to read through all the messages on Discord everyday (where all the latest project information can be found.) For you who can\u2019t be bothered with following social media. For you who just generally wants to have a life and still get the occasional updates on Verus and its ecosystem. And everyone else is welcome too.\n\nNext to publishing the monthly recap on Medium, I will send the exact same content through a newsletter. Subscribe here. I\u2019ll try to keep things short and to the point. So let\u2019s get started with the very first monthly recap.\nAugust 2021\nPreparing Testnet for Ethereum Bridge\nThe multi-chain testnet has been reset. This in preperation for the bridge to the Rinkeby testnet. It has been said we are very close to this game-changing release.\nWallet Updates\nHighly recommended non-mandatory Verus Desktop and CLI wallet updates have been made available. (Critical for notaries and pools). Download v0.7.4 here\nConversations with Mike & Bluesky\nBluesky is an initiative from Twitter to create a decentralized social media platform. Verus lead developer Mike Toutonghi had some very interesting posts in their Discord channel explaining the benefits that Verus and VerusID can bring to their project. Everyone in their Discord is still shell-shocked from the bombs that Mike dropped on them. Read a part of the messages here. Verus has been selected to start a workgroup to integrate with OpenID. The future will tell if it is something worthwhile. One big positive is that more people, and especially developers, will learn about Verus. You can read all the messages back in the Bluesky Discord, and please keep the shilling to yourself. We want to foster professional and productive environments.\n\nGiant Website Overhaul\nWe are close to finishing a giant website overhaul. Better, more concise messaging. Easier to understand copywriting. More illustrations. Clearer design. All-in-all easier to digest for all people. I personally can\u2019t wait for it to be online. I believe it to be a great improvement that will definitely get more people more interested in Verus.\n\nMobile Wallet Developments\nInteresting progress on the mobile development front. Verus Mobile will be able to function as an encrypted local repository for your personal data, creating a central place for you to securely store information about yourself (that only you control.) This data allows you to integrate your wallet with in-app service providers that extend application functionality. Initially, this is how fiat on/off ramp services (Wyre) will be connected to the wallet. Later on, VerusID integration gives users the power to prove information about themselves in a decentralized, self-sovereign way. Exciting stuff!\n\nNew Docs Website\nIn addition to the new website we are working on a documentation website.

This article explains why, gives an in-depth view of all the options and parameters, and teaches how to launch these currencies. Welcome to Verus, a fundamentally different protocol, and the future of currency launches and value creation.\n\nWhat are Currencies?\nLet\u2019s go back to basics first. Currencies, also called tokens on many other cryptocurrency protocols, are a critical part of what makes blockchain useful. They can be used as a means of accounting, can represent property or rights external to the blockchain, and over bridges can be thought of as a means of communication or data transfer between blockchains.\nA real-life example is a project that uses the Verus Protocol to account for energy production, transfer and usage. Other examples can be a token pegged to a fiat currency which is a representation of property external to the blockchain. Or fractionalized tokenization of assets, so many can share in group ownership of something. With all the capabilities Verus has in ways to relate tokens and currencies with VerusIDs (and subIDs), novel use cases arise naturally.\nAnd what makes Verus currencies so powerful is that there is no coding involved. It is just creating a transaction, and then sending that transaction to the blockchain making the currency a reality. Anyone can do it.\nBetter, Faster, Cheaper and More Secure\nWhy is it smarter to launch currencies on the Verus Protocol? The answer is simple, because all launched currencies are part of the consensus mechanism. On EVM-like and account-based protocols (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche) currencies are not part of consensus and thus easily exploitable by smart contract bugs and malicious developers. With Verus, a UTXO model, all currencies are accounted for, and verified by the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, making it as secure as sending BTC on Bitcoin. To make it simple \u2014 all features on the Verus Protocol are on the first layer, the consensus layer.\nVerus fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape\nAlso, where other protocols need L2 solutions which are mostly centralized, Verus includes self-sovereign identities, namespaces, privacy, DeFi, bridges, and currency and blockchain launches on the first layer. An innovation that fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape.\nLaunching currencies with Verus is also much faster and cheaper than with the alternatives. The magic here is that there is no coding involved. Anyone can launch a currency by just choosing the options and parameters they would like. It is as easy as typing in a command and the currency is ready to be used by the world within minutes. This process does not involve expensive Solidity developers or security audits, saving a lot of development costs.\nAnother big advantage is being able to export launched currencies to Ethereum as ERC-20. These currencies can then partake in the Ethereum ecosystem, yet have better security and cheaper DeFi transactions than when they are created on Ethereum itself. Each ERC-20 token can also be bridged to Verus. It\u2019s all super easy thanks to the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge.\nThis is not all some fantasy, this is all functional (the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is in testing), right now, on mainnet, on the Verus Protocol. As you now know, Verus is built fundamentally differently than any other protocol out there, and ushers in a new era for brands, communities, businesses, entrepreneurs and organizations to create value in a better and more secure way than ever before.\nThe next chapter explains the options to choose from when launching currencies.\nOptions to Launch Currencies\nFor ease of explaining, all PBaaS-chain launch options are omitted. Good to know \u2014 with Verus anyone can also launch fully interoperable, independent and customizable blockchains with all the same L1 features as the Verus blockchain. The focus of this article is on launching currencies only, on Verus or any other PBaaS-chain.\nTo launch a currency on Verus (and any other PBaaS-chain) a namespace is needed. That namespace is a VerusID. The namespace is the name of the currency (e.g. MyBrand@). That namespace can also have subIDs (e.g. product.MyBrand@, user.MyBrand@, more on this later).\nOn Verus a VerusID registration costs between 20 and 100 VRSC, and the launch of a currency costs 200 VRSC. These costs are always paid in the chain\u2019s native coin (to the worldwide miners and stakers). On other PBaaS-chains these costs can differ since the chain launcher can define its own costs for VerusID registrations and currency launches.\nTo define a currency, choose options. Then combine these options to whatever the currency needs to be. Just add the numbers together in the currency definition. The currency options are listed below.\noptions:1 \u2014 The currency has reserves, and can be converted to and from the reserves (option 32 needs to be added). Can have one currency as its reserves, or multiple with up to 10 currencies. Let\u2019s call it a \u201cBasket currency\u201d \u2014 a currency with a basket of reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized.\noptions:2 \u2014 Only the controlling VerusID (the namespace of the currency, the rootID) can create subIDs.\noptions:8 \u2014 Referrals and discounts are enabled for subID creation.\noptions:16 \u2014 Referrals are required for subID creation.\noptions:32 \u2014 The currency is a simple token currency without any reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized. This option is also used for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens.\noptions:2048 \u2014 A single satoshi (0.00000001) NFT token is created & has tokenized control of the root VerusID. Which means you can send the single satoshi token to other addresses and then they have control of the root VerusID.\nLet\u2019s give some examples of combined options:\n\"options\":33 \u2014 this launches a basket currency. It is options 1 + 32 combined.\n\"options\":2080 \u2014 this launches a single satoshi token that has control of the root VerusID. It is options 32 + 2048 combined.\n\"options\":35 \u2014 this launches a basket currency, and only the rootID can create subIDs. It is options 1 + 2 + 32 combined.\nAnd so on. More information on basket currencies, simple token currencies and subIDs in the next chapter.\nTwo Types of Currencies\nThere are two types of currencies that can be launched with the Verus Protocol. Basket currencies and simple token currencies. Both can be issued decentralized, or centralized (has minting and burning capabilities.)\nBasket Currencies\nA simple example of a basket currency containing two reserve currencies.\nBasket currencies are magical currencies that have reserves. Have a look at the simplified image. If anyone has currency X or Y, they can convert to the basket currency, or convert from reserve to reserve. If anyone has the basket currency, they can go to currency X or Y. A basket currency can have 1 and up to 10 reserve currencies.\nThe basket currency supply is dynamic, depending on how much is converted to the basket currency (supply minted), or back to its reserve(s) (supply burned).\nA basket currency can be 100% backed by its reserves, 5%, or anything in between. This is called the reserve ratio, or the weight. The lower the reserve ratio, the more volatile the currency is when people are converting into or out of the basket currency. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to what is in the reserves and what the reserve ratio is.\nWhen a centralized version of this currency is created, the owner of the rootID can mint currencies into existence, while automatically lowering the reserve ratio. Or they can burn currencies and automatically raise the reserve ratio. Anyone can also just burn the currency at will without raising the reserve ratio.\nThe conversion fees are incredibly low, 0.025% when converting to and from a basket currency, and 0.05% when converting from reserve to reserve currency. These fees go directly to the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, and/or they are accrued into the reserves making the basket currency worth more.\nBecause all currency conversions are solved simultaneously inside a block, giving all participants the same price, the protocol is MEV-free. The protocol doesn\u2019t have any of the problems EVM-like account-based systems have. Verus DeFi is fair, cheap and has no rent-seekers.\nEvery(!) currency on the Verus network (also mapped ERC-20s!), can be used as reserves for basket currencies. As you might start to understand now \u2014 basket currencies are unique currencies that can not be found anywhere else and offer an enormous amount of opportunities for value creation. And anyone can launch them without needing any programming knowledge!\nSimple Token Currencies\nSimple token currencies are just currencies without any reserves. They are not as exciting as the basket currencies, yet still offer much value. With all the parameters that can be added, subIDs created and decentralized crowdfund mechanism, these currencies can support a lot of use cases that are difficult to do with alternative protocols. A small example of a centralized currency here.\nThe supply of this type of currency is static when it\u2019s a decentralized version. When it\u2019s a centralized version, the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn them.\nThis option is also used to create currencies that are mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s. Which means you can send those ERC-20s over to Verus, or from Verus to the ERC-20. This is made possible with the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge. You can read more about it here.\nAnd of course, a simple token currency can be one of the reserves in a basket currency.\nWhat are SubIDs\nSubIDs are powerful objects on the blockchain. They can be registered in an unlimited amount under any created currency (basket and simple token currency). A few examples are product.MyBrand@ or user.MyBrand@. The name MyBrand@ is a VerusID (a namespace) that is converted into a currency. The subIDs are \u2018product\u2019 and \u2018user\u2019.\nSubIDs can be bound digitally to many things. They can be bound to people and products. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private. Including provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the subID itself.\nAnother powerful feature is that it has read, write and delete functions in what is called the \u201ccontent multimap\u201d. All kinds of information can be read and processed in the mempool of the blockchain.\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there, it\u2019s also a friendly name blockchain address that can receive, send, hold and stake funds, and can be used to login to services, password-free. Read more about VerusID here.\nParameters to Launch Currencies\nThis is all anyone needs to do to launch powerful currencies. Zero coding!\nNext up are the parameters. Choose the parameters wisely to launch a currency that suits any need. Not all parameters are needed or combinable. There are many to go through, so let\u2019s start.\n\u201cproofprotocol\u201d\nThis parameter defines, among others, if the currency is centralized or decentralized. You can choose 1,2 or 3.\n1 is default, which launches a decentralized currency (no need to include this parameter when defining such a currency). When subIDs are created with this option, the registration fees are burned.\n2 is for a centralized currency. If it\u2019s a basket currency the rootID can mint and burn supply while automatically lowering and raising the reserve ratio (also anyone can burn supply without lowering the reserve ratio). Or when it\u2019s a simple token currency they can just mint and burn supply. The subID registration fees go to the rootID.\n3 is for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens. Read more here\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"MyBrand\", \n  \"options\":32, \n  \"proofprotocol\":2, \n  \"preallocations\":[{\"Klaus@\":100}]\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d A simple token currency called MyBrand, centralized (the controller of the rootID can mint and burn), and has a preallocation of 100 tokens to Klaus@.\n\u201ccurrencies\u201d\nHere you put the names of the currencies (or just one \u2014 it must have VRSC when launched on Verus) that will be in the reserves when it\u2019s a basket currency (options:33).\nOr when it\u2019s a simple token currency (options:32), what people convert during the preconversion timeframe will go to the rootID of the currency, as a funding mechanism. In the case of a simple token currency, combine it with \"conversions\" to determine the preconversion price.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"CommunityX\", \n  \"options\":33, \n  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\",\"MyBrand\"], \n  \"minpreconversion\":[10,50],\n  \"initialsupply\":100\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d A basket currency called CommunityX. It needs to get a minimum of 10 VRSCTEST and 50 MyBrand into its reserves within the preconversion time frame to be launched. The initial supply of 100 CommunityX will be distributed among the preconverters.\n\u201cconversions\u201d\nUse this parameter when launching a simple token currency. Together with \"currencies\", it can be used as a funding mechanism for the rootID. It\u2019s for the preconversion price. So when doing \"conversions\":[0.1], it means that for every VRSC the preconverter receives 10 CURRENCY after launch. The converted VRSC goes into the rootID.\nPeople can preconvert to this currency within the preconversion time frame. Define a \"startblock\", or let the default and minimum time frame play out, which is 20 blocks.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"CoolBrand\",\n  \"options\":32,\n  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\n  \"conversions\":[0.1],\n  \"minpreconversion\":[1000]\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This simple token currency is called CoolBrand. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 1000 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 10.000 CoolBrand. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds back.\n\u201cminpreconversion\u201d\nUse this parameter to set a minimum amount of preconversions. The minimum amount of preconversions needs to be met or the currency will not launch and everyone gets their conversions returned, minus the transaction and conversion fees. It works both with basket currencies and simple token currencies.\nThere is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting. Take this into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"CompanyX\",\n  \"options\":32,\n  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\n  \"conversions\":[2],\n  \"minpreconversion\":[500]\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This simple token currency is called CompanyX. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 250 CompanyX. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds back.\n\u201cmaxpreconversions\u201d\nUse this parameter to set a maximum amount of preconversions. During the preconversion time frame the amount set can not be exceeded. Everything above this amount will be automatically refunded after the currency is launched.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"CoinCommunity\", \n  \"options\":33, \n  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"], \n  \"maxpreconversion\":[100], \n  \"initialsupply\":100\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This is a basket currency called CoinCommunity. During the preconversion time frame people can convert VRSCTEST into its reserves for 100 CoinCommunity in return. During the preconversion time frame there can not be more than 100 VRSCTEST converted into its reserves. Whatever is preconverted more will be returned.\n\u201cinitialcontributions\u201d\nThe rootID can contribute some or all of the minimum preconversions directly as part of the currency definition. Use this parameter to make an initial contribution to either the reserves when it\u2019s a basket currency (options:33), or to the rootID when it\u2019s a simple token currency (options:32).\nThe funds to initially contribute need to be in the rootID when defining the currency. After the preconversion time frame is over and the currency launched, the rootID has received an amount of the launched currency.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"CommunityBasket\", \n  \"options\":33, \n  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\",\"CoinCommunity\"], \n  \"initialcontributions\":[10,200], \n  \"initialsupply\":100, \n  \"preallocations\":[{\"Jane@\":100},{\"John@\":50}]\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This is a basket currency called CommunityBasket. The launcher of the currency wanted to make initial contributions to its reserves. At the moment of broadcasting the currency to the network, there needed to be 210 VRSCTEST and 200 CoinCommunity in the rootID. The initial supply of 100 went to the rootID (if there weren\u2019t any more preconverters). At the same time of the launch, 100 CoinCommunity was minted into Jane@ and 50 into John@, this lowered the reserve ratio of the currency.\n\u201cinitialsupply\u201d\nA required parameter for basket currencies (options:33). Does not work with simple token currencies. This is the initial supply during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People preconverting into the reserves receive from this initial supply.\nImmediately after the currency is launched, the supply can be larger due to \"preallocations\".\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"SocialBrand\", \n  \"options\":33, \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"], \n  \"initialsupply\":500, \n  \"preallocations\":[{\"Max@\":1000}]\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This is a basket currency called SocialBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves and in return they get 500 SocialBrand distributed among them. Immediately after launch Max@ receives 1000 SocialBrand, lowering the reserve ratio of the currency.\n\u201cpreallocations\u201d\nUse this parameter to receive a chosen amount of funds after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. Funds can be directed to VerusIDs. Works with simple token currencies and basket currencies.\nWhen using this parameter with basket currencies, after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, the reserve ratio is lowered. This is because new currency has been minted after the initial supply (\"initialsupply\") is distributed.\n\u201cprelaunchcarveout\u201d\nOnly works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the rootID.\nAfter the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, a percentage of the reserves is taken and redirected to the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio, making the currency more volatile.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"BusinessBrand\", \n  \"options\":33, \n  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"], \n  \"initialsupply\":100, \n  \"prelaunchcarveout\":0.1\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This is a basket currency called BusinessBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 BusinessBrand distributed among them. When the currency is launched, 10% VRSCTEST is taken out of the reserves, into the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio by 10%.\n\u201cprelaunchdiscount\u201d\nOnly works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to give people a discount during the preconversion time frame. After the preconversion time frame and the currency is launched, the conversion price will be higher, depending on what percentage the discount was.\nWhen using this parameter, after the currency is launched, the reserve ratio will be lowered by the discounted percentage.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"DiscountBrand\", \n  \"options\":33, \n  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"], \n  \"initialsupply\":100, \n  \"prelaunchdiscount\":0.5\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This is a basket currency called DiscountBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 DiscountBrand distributed among them. Immediately after the launch of the currency, when people want to convert, the price is 50% higher. Also, the reserve ratio is 50% lower because of the prelaunchdiscount.\n\u201cweights\u201d\nOnly works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to change the respective weights of the reserves in a basket currency. The total of all weights must equal 1. With a minimum of 0.1, since there can\u2019t be more than 10 reserve currencies in a basket currency.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"MyBusiness\", \n  \"options\":33, \n  \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\",\"BusinessBrand\",\"DiscountBrand\"], \n  \"initialsupply\":100, \n  \"weights\":[0.5,0.25,0.25]\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This is a basket currency called MyBusiness. During the preconversion time frame there are various currencies that can be converted into its reserves. They have different weights to them. 0.5 for VRSCTEST, 0.25 for both BusinessBrand and DiscountBrand.\n\u201cstartblock\u201d\nUse this parameter to define the block height when the currency is launched. There is a preconversion time frame before the currency is launched. When omitting this parameter it uses a 20 block preconversion time frame before the currency is launched.\nThe preconversion time frame is always 20 blocks, this can not be less.\n\u201cendblock\u201d\nEndblock can not be defined on basket currencies. It does nothing. It could be set as a signal to software that might use the basket currency.\nIt can be set on centralized (proofprotcol:2) simple token currencies. When the endblock is reached, it turns the centralized currency into a decentralized one.\n\u201cidregistrationfees\u201d\nUse this parameter to change the costs of registering subIDs under the rootID. The default registration fee is 100.\nWhen it\u2019s a decentralized currency the fees are burned, when it\u2019s centralized the fees go to the rootID.\nTo enable discounts when using referrals, add \"options\":8 to the currency definition.\n\u201cidreferrallevels\u201d\nUse this parameter to change the levels of referrals used when registering subIDs. The default is 3 levels.\n\u201cnativecurrencyid\u201d\nUse this parameter for mapped ERC-20 tokens. The parameter includes the Ethereum contract address for the ERC-20. Read here for more information.\nThese were all the parameters to use when defining currencies. There are many, and combining them in the right ways make powerful currencies and tokens. The community is always ready to help when defining and launching currencies for your use cases! Please go to Discord and ask away.\nThe next chapter explains how to exactly launch these currencies.\nHow to Launch the Currencies\nLaunching these currencies is quite easy. Launch with the command-line interface, or Verus Desktop for Windows, Linux or macOS. Download here.\nIn the chapter before many examples of currency definitions are given. Let\u2019s use one and see how it is launched.\nFirst of all let\u2019s see the difference between launching with Verus Desktop and the command-line interface. Verus testnet is used for testing purposes.\n\u26a0\ufe0f It is highly recommended to launch currencies on testnet first before going to mainnet! \u26a0\ufe0f\nVerus Desktop: go to \u201cSettings\u201d (cogwheel top-right) -> \u201cCoin Settings\u201d. There you see an input field.\nHere you can run commands in Verus Desktop\nTo use the input field and launch a currency on Verus Desktop (see run before the command):\nrun definecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"MyBrand\",\n  \"options\":32, \n  \"proofprotocol\":2, \n  \"preallocations\":[{\"Klaus@\":100}]\n}\u2019\nCommand-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency \u2018{\n  \"name\":\"MyBrand\",\n  \"options\":32, \n  \"proofprotocol\":2, \n  \"preallocations\":[{\"Klaus@\":100}]\n}'\nNow, after doing these commands in either Verus Desktop or the command-line interface you get a HEX returned. It\u2019s a very large array of letters and numbers. We need to use this HEX to broadcast the currency to the blockchain. Only then will the currency really start and the funds taken (distributed to the miners and stakers) for the launch.\nUsing the HEX\nTo start the currency use these commands:\nVerus Desktop:\nrun sendrawtransaction \"HEX\"\nCommand-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction \"HEX\"\nAfter doing these commands the currency has started, the funds from the rootID are taken, and it takes a minimum of 20 blocks to actually launch it (and if all preconversion goals are met).\nCurrency information\nDuring the preconversion time frame and after the launch you can lookup all kinds of information on the currency.\nVerus Desktop:\nrun getcurrency \"MyBrand\"\nCommand-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency \"MyBrand\"\nNow you know everything to launch currencies! \ud83d\udc49 The worldwide community is happy to help on Discord!\nStart to Build\nFor all the builders out there, you can start to use the Verus Protocol right now for your Dapps or businesses.

This is about my perspective on what these barriers are and how Verus fixes them, without getting into all the technicalities.\n\nThe Lay of the Land\nFirst, let me say this open, borderless, neutral and censorship-resistant stuff is only interesting because of exactly those qualities. It is innovation in its purest form. I can find a market, create a product, and it\u2019s there forever as long as the market exists. Not held back by anyone or anything with opposing vested interests. It\u2019s a beautiful thing.\nInnovation always comes from the bottom-up, never top-down. We are that bottom, we have that power. It may sting, hurt or annoy at first, but eventually, it is accepted and normalized. And so this (still) cowboy cryptocurrency stuff is not any different.\nAnd let\u2019s be clear, innovative entrepreneurship is what this is all about. Contrary to what many people might believe, we can not expect innovation from already established companies. We can not expect them to adopt blockchain technology that is open, borderless, neutral and censorship-resistant. They have everything to gain with keeping the status quo, and more to lose by changing it.\nThe future of cryptocurrency will be single-purpose blockchains. Every idea for a business and project, no matter how big or small, will be created with their own blockchain and thus coin. All working collectively through seamless interoperability or bridging capabilities.\nWe are at the beginning of this very young technology, we haven\u2019t seen anything yet. Innovate entrepreneurs will want to have the ability to find a platform that gives them the tools to bootstrap their project fast and easy.\nLet\u2019s Get Started\nNow, you are all fired up because you have a great crypto project in mind that will get people excited. How do you even start? What are the hoops you have to jump through before you can start building something? What are the problems you can encounter when you have a genius blockchain project idea? Here are some questions I asked myself before:\nHow will I get funding to get my project going?\nDo I want to do an ICO? How does this work legally?\nDo I do a pre-mine? What is a reasonable amount?\nHow do I get a blockchain running with enough miners? Who would want to start mining a small project?\nHow will I get liquidity in my coin?\nGetting funding for your project is always a tricky and scary thing. How to organize receiving the funds? And how organize the sending of coins in return? I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with any liability issues. What if the minimum funding goal isn\u2019t reached? Or what if it was so successful it went over the maximum funding goal? I would be sitting on a pile of crypto to send back manually. Lots of work, lots of moving parts, many things can go wrong.\nHow about getting myself a piece of the pie. Do I do a pre-mine? What would be a reasonable amount so investors still take you seriously? Are there other ways to get skin in the game?\nHow about all the legal matters? ICO, IEO, private investors? Trusting third parties? Some governments are even excluding their citizens from participating in crypto investments. My head starts to spin even thinking about all this nonsensical stuff. I just want to build cool stuff.\nThen, when building a product on a blockchain, an actual chain is needed. How do you start with that? Get self-paid infrastructure at first and hope others will join in mining your chain? How will I make sure I get enough miners so I won\u2019t get attacked? Double spend protection? Can I use existing platforms for this? Get into business with service providers to make all this happen? How about coin economics?\nOkay, cool, I got my chain running. Now, how about liquidity? It costs huge amounts of money to get listed on decent exchanges. I\u2019d rather spend that money on developing an actual product. Maybe smaller exchanges are happy to list your coin for a modest amount, or even for free. But now I might put my userbase at risk, needing to trust small exchanges with security risks. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time less known exchanges are attacked, and it sure as hell won\u2019t be the last.\nThese are all just some examples of the many considerations one has to make before getting a crypto project started. It\u2019s a lot. How glorious would it be if there is a platform that addresses all of these questions for you in a simple, elegant way? And the most critical requirement: it is trustless.\nVerus Got You Covered\nGetting your project started through the Verus platform will be a breeze. With just a few clicks you could be on your way, saving yourself a whole lot of brain energy best spent elsewhere: on the development of your product. Verus gives you the possibility to get funding, instant liquidity, a secure blockchain, all in a decentralized, trustless way. The means to start your blockchain are countless. Nobody can stop you now.\nDo a Kickstarter-like launch for your blockchain. Set minimum and maximum funding goals. If the goal is reached, the blockchain starts, everyone gets the coins they paid for. If the minimum isn\u2019t reached, everything is paid back automatically.\nChoose to create a reserve currency blockchain. Meaning there will always be liquidity for your coin. All the funds from your Kickstarter-launch will go into the liquidity pool. Choose what percentage, if any, you want to receive yourself.\nDo you want to get a pre-mine? No problem. Choose your amount. It\u2019s only one out of many properties you can specify. Of course, this is all prepared before your Kickstarter-launch.\nIs your project interesting? Then miners within the Verus ecosystem will pick it up for you to maximize their profits. They can mine up to 22 chains simultaneously so it\u2019s a no-brainer. Maybe miners need a little extra motivation? Add some $VRSC to sweeten the pot. Boom, you have a chain running that is decentralized and protected against 51% attacks.\nThis is just a tiny amount of detail into how the whole system works, and all the specifications that can be customized. But for me, these are the most interesting. It all works together in harmony to create comfort, safety and ease of use for entrepreneurs and investors alike. These are the systems of the future. They will bring unique ideas, inspiring people, and new markets together. Exciting times are coming.\n\nJoin the discussion & share your ideas on Verus.io/discord\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: #2 Ben\u2019s Pocket Guide to Verus Coin for Dummies And Smart People Too.\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/a-pocket-guide-to-verus-coin-f0c86e976c33\nContent:\n\nVerus virtus potest esse emit / True virtue cannot be bought \u2014 anonymous\n\n#2 Ben\u2019s Pocket Guide to Verus Coin for Dummies And Smart People Too.\nA brief overview of this extremely decentralized and fairly launched project that takes aim at solving big problems with fake news, trust in election results and voting as well as restoring your privacy when you vote. This post will give you all the reasons you want to mine, stake and be involved with Verus Coin.\nWith Verus, we plan to create a platform upon which we will build voting and even election systems that support our vision of enabling a better society through blockchain. To run simultaneous polls across disparate populations on one blockchain-based system, we need another dimension of information \u2014 one that retains privacy, and is anchored to a primary store of value, Verus.\nFirst Public Blockchains as a Service project (PBaaS).\nFirst fairly mined coin to create a foundation, over 4MM raised through community contributions of mined coins to sustain the long-term vision.\nA fair launch with nothing held back and no pre-mine which means mining started for everyone at the same time.\nThe World\u2019s fastest CPU hash and ASIC resistant right down to it\u2019s DNA, which means maximum decentralization because of the low mining barrier.\n50% Proof of Work and 50% Proof of Stake which means you can put your coins to work mining(make sure to shield and unshield the coins you mine)\nSecured by delayed proof of work. A Friendly fork of Komodo, which means it benefits from delayed proof of work (creates a restore point on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain in case of attack).\nDid not do a ICO or try to raise funds. Solely focused on building working tech.\nCredible. Mike Toutonghi is Lead Dev and was Former Vice President and Technical Fellow at Microsoft, recognized founder and architect of Microsoft\u2019s .Net platform, ex-Technical Fellow of Microsoft\u2019s advertising platform, ex-CTO, Parallels Corporation, experienced distributed computing and machine learning architect.\nMounting a 51% hash attack against such a hybrid algorithm operating at 50% proof of work and 50% proof of stake, even if there were such a thing as a Verus ASIC in the hands of a few, would effectively require much more than 51% of the network hash power and/or a great deal of the Verus coin supply as well. \u2014 Mike Toutonghi\nWhat problem is Verus Coin solving?\nThe project solves the problems people face when they give up their privacy to vote or have a voice. It\u2019s about being able to authenticate who you are in a trustless election or vote without giving up your identity or data, and being able to trust the results.\nWe believe that this technology can be world-changing in critical public systems like polls and voting, as well as identity systems and learning from the whole of human knowledge. \u2014 Mike Toutonghi\nWhy is privacy and anonymity important?\nThe more someone knows about you, the more power they can have over you. We live in the a Golden Age for big data, advanced algorithms and machine learning, yet the average citizen has no idea how much can be known about them from the data they freely or inadvertently give away, or how that can be used to manipulate their decisions and opinions.\nImportantly, one of the key parts of democracy is the secret ballot. Nobody should know how you voted so they can\u2019t influence your vote in any way.\nWith blockchain voting, the information that registers on the blockchain shouldn\u2019t include identifiable information. This means that information about the sender of the voting token has to be hidden. There are different ways to accomplish this, including zero knowledge proofs, ring transactions, or various encryption methods. Each has its benefits, drawbacks, and technical challenges. True anonymity at the same time as verified identity is the big challenge of blockchain voting.\n- How Blockchain Voting Works & Why We Need It\nPrivacy has to be default because privacy is a limit on government power, as well as the power of private sector companies.\nThe transparency paradox: big data collects all kinds of personal data about individuals, but its own operations are completely opaque.\nThe identity paradox: big data seeks to identify at the expense of individual and collective identity.\nThe power paradox: while seen as useful for public interest, big data privileges governments and corporate entities at the expense of ordinary individuals.\n- HOW BIG DATA CAN BE USED AGAINST YOU\nRemember the story about how Target figured out a teen girl was pregnant before her Father did?\nIf we send someone a catalog and say, \u2018Congratulations on your first child!\u2019 and they\u2019ve never told us they\u2019re pregnant, that\u2019s going to make some people uncomfortable,\u201d Pole told me. \u201cWe are very conservative about compliance with all privacy laws. But even if you\u2019re following the law, you can do things where people get queasy.\n- HOW COMPANIES LEARN YOUR SECRETS\nIf you ask an expert what Verus Coin is, you might hear this\u2026\nThe biggest asset we see Verus creating in today\u2019s modern world is a secure, scalable, trustless voting system, able to be used in all different kinds of electoral models, in parallel with a secure, scalable identification system. This combination would allow everyone in either a governed society, corporation, or any group to have a chance to fairly contribute to their community, and have their opinion represented without having to worry about corruption, or fraud. \u2014 Mike Toutonghi\nRemember the claims of fake news that surrounded the USA and Brexit elections and the doubts about the validity of the results?\nIt has to happen without anyone thinking it\u2019s propaganda, because the moment you think \u2018that\u2019s propaganda\u2019 the next question is: \u2018Who\u2019s put that out?\u2019\n- CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA CEO ALEXANDER NIX DESCRIBES \u201cSHADOW\u201d ELECTION TACTICS\nIf your Grandma asked you what Verus Coin was, you might say\u2026\nIt means when you cast a vote or answer a question you can validate your identity without your data or losing your anonymity. This means only the vote itself counts while ensuring the validity of the results. Take the example of a local election. It would mean you could prove you were a citizen of your country and locality and entitled to vote without giving up your identity or data to the people running the election.\nHow will the government/corporations benefit?\nA secure, scalable, trustless voting system, able to be used in all different kinds of electoral models, in parallel with a secure, scalable identification system. This combination would allow everyone in either a governed society, corporation, or any group to have a chance to fairly contribute to their community, and have their opinion represented without having to worry about corruption, or fraud or repercussion.\nThe $VRSC Coin uses and purpose.\nAn obvious use is that it\u2019ll be used to mine more coins because Verus Coin is 50% Proof of Stake. This means that the more coins you own, the more mining power you have.\nEven your Grandma could mine this with her old Wins 95 laptop!\n$VRSC will of course be used to power polls, votes and elections using autochains. These autochains can be as temporary or as durable as needed.\nAnd, Nodes will be paid for routing transactions and ranked for performance and stability. To keep the network strong.\nThere are also genuine cryptocurrency uses for $VRSC too, however, I don\u2019t want to over-egg the pudding!\nInfographic created by community member @M_eyse\nSo far, Verus Coin has proven to be working tech and NO hype.\nIt\u2019s asking us to participate in taking back our privacy and to be part of a movement that will be world-changing in critical public systems like polls and voting, as well as identity systems.\nForget the hype \u2014 build things\u2026 \u2014 Ivan on Tech\nIt\u2019s a project that\u2019s building working tech right out of the gate, with minimal fuss and marketing. There is no marketing team because this isn\u2019t about raising funds and paying big bonuses. It\u2019s about a decentralized movement and a strong, involved community.\nInfographic created by community member @M_eyse\nLet\u2019s review Verus Coin\u2019s key features\u2026\nA completely new proof of work / proof of stake hybrid algorithm with 50% of each for maximum protection against 51% attacks, further backed by Komodo platform\u2019s delegated proof of work, which offers additional attack protection and recycles Bitcoin\u2019s hashpower, making Verus coin possibly the most attack resistant decentralized blockchain in existence. Delayed proof of work basically creates a system restore or checkpoint on Bitcoin\u2019s chain. Because Bitcoin has by far the largest hashrate it\u2019s incredibly secure.\nInfographic created by community member @M_eyse\nThe fastest proof of work has in the world by far on CPUs, furthering the goal of extreme decentralization by making Verus Coin mineable by anyone with a PC or laptop.\nFrom what I understand, even though GPUs will soon be able to mine Verus, the performance tests discussed in Discord suggest that CPUs will be effective for mining indefinitely, at least until ASICs are developed for VerusHash.\nThis is a project aiming to protect people\u2019s identities and data when they vote, so it makes sense they have Zero knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) for maximum privacy, enabling a mix of bitcoin style transactions that are openly explorable combined with completely, provably zero knowledge transactions, where sender, receiver, and amount are mathematically, provably private and can include encrypted messages as well.\nAt launch there were larger, time locked rewards to the earliest participants, ensuring no risk of significant supply entering the market and being dumped all at once.\nThe VerusHash mining algorithm is built to provide a solution to the current ASIC situation in crypto. Not only is it the fastest CPU mining algorithm in the world right now, but because of the fact that it leverages extreme integration in modern day processors, effectively treating their internals as mini, high speed ASICs, it allows people to mine easily from their laptop or PC and actually earn as much VRSC for their investment as even big miners, because they aren\u2019t competing with specialized, purpose-built machines or on an algorithm where GPUs have a major advantage. \u2014 @MikeToutonghi\nFrom the very beginning, all mining and staking rewards equal to or over 192 Verus were time locked for release and first use randomly over the next 25 months.\nInfographic created by community member @M_eyse\nAs of the next halving where rewards halve to 96 Verus, they will not be time locked and will be available for staking or trading within 100 blocks from being staked or mined.\nProject Roadmap\nDELIVERED Phase One \u2014 Mainnet, 50/50 PoW/PoS , Time Locks and Fair Launch\nWORKING ON Phase Two \u2014 Autochains, Polls and Verus Mobile\nPhase Three \u2014 Identity, and Proof of Virtue\nPhase Four \u2014 Integrated Machine Learning, Content and Storage\nGraphic found in the White Paper\nWhat\u2019s Next?

Fortunately, Verus Coin\u2019s proof of power consensus algorithm, a hybrid of proof of work and proof of stake, had just been proven immune to 51% hash attacks, leaving the project more protected than most blockchains in such a scenario.\nAt the same time, with the significant economic advantage that owners of FPGA systems had over CPUs and GPUs for mining, Verus Coin\u2019s hash power quickly centralized to mainly FPGA miners\u2026and die-hard community members who remained dedicated to the ideals of the Verus Project and trusted that the Verus community devs would solve this problem, as they had so many in the past.\nRather than fork to yet another random selection of hash algorithms or the hardest of memory hard solutions to reduce the types of FPGAs that could even run a hash, the Verus Coin community and developers decided to take a completely new approach.\nNow, since we know you\u2019re DYING to find out the mind-blowing answer to number 8, we\u2019ll get right to the point, skip numbers 1 through 7 and go straight to 8!\n\nNumber 8 (aka What Happened Next!)\nAs soon as FPGAs were confirmed, an immediate and intense effort by community devs and others on everything from the wallet to the pools, to Electrum servers, and exchanges resulted in a brand new and very different hardware equalization algorithm that somehow, the Verus Community managed to activate, in what could possibly be described as a \u201cperfect fork\u201d, only weeks from when FPGA miners were confirmed.\nUnlike past efforts to equalize hardware hash-rates across different hardware types, VerusHash 2.0 explicitly enables CPUs to gain even more power relative to GPUs and FPGAs, enabling the most decentralizing hardware, CPUs (due to their virtually complete market penetration), to stay relevant as miners for the indefinite future.\nAnd how appropriate that the numbers on the newly released GPU miner came in, demonstrating successful hardware equalization on Jan 3, the 10th anniversary of Bitcoin itself. To our knowledge, VerusHash 2.0 is the first algorithm to fully equalize GPUs in a way that leaves them an option for mining, but not as fast or efficient as mid-to-high-end CPUs.\nA Foundation of Decentralization\nBitcoin originally began as simply digital, peer-to-peer money, secured using a distributed proof of work consensus algorithm, with the work (mining) originally being designed to run on CPUs.\nWhy CPUs? What\u2019s so special about them? Was it because more powerful hardware didn\u2019t yet exist? At the time it could have been designed to be mined by more powerful devices, corporate budget-level computing, IBM mainframes.\nWhy did Satoshi point to CPUs as the original hardware for mining? And was it Satoshi\u2019s intent to see his algorithm put out of reach of the masses with computers by companies making specialized hardware?\nIn Verus Coin, the community consensus was clear: focus on decentralization and have no fear when solving any problem presented. The community bet is that Satoshi would have preferred that mining be accessible to the broadest number of people, and that enabling CPUs to continue to mine, even alongside more specialized hardware, would be a holy grail of decentralization.\nAn FPGA is a specialized hardware device, similar to an ASIC in performance and design but, unlike an ASIC, is re-programmable. It requires advanced development of mining algorithms, which are released as \u201cbitstreams\u201d, used to flash the memory of the FPGA to the latest algorithm of the target coin(s).\nVerus community member Seth David (aka Godballz on Discord) just published a very informative and interesting article discussing FPGAs and other specialized hardware in more depth. You can read his post here.\nVerus lead developer Mike Toutonghi reached out to the company behind the FPGA bitstream and secret mining community, in an effort to work together for the betterment of open source FPGA mining software which could work well with the new VerusHash algorithm, which he was designing to bring equalization between hardware types.\nAlthough the company did not come to an agreement with the Verus Coin community, Verus made the decision to fork to a newly developed algorithm. In under 3 weeks, the update was released, and the fork was set for December 28 at block height 310,000 on the Verus blockchain.\nVerusHash 2.0 Design\nWhile this new algorithm was only mineable by CPU hardware in the first week, with GPUs to soon follow, the lead developer of Verus Coin, Mike Toutonghi worked closely with the primary community GPU dev to help ensure that GPUs had the best chance possible to mine effectively on the new algorithm as well.\n\u201cI believe in progress. Progress of hardware, software, AND algorithms. We are doing this to create an algorithm that doesn\u2019t favor one type of hardware over another, but helps ensure that proof of work measurement is economically comparable across as many types of hardware and with a total of the broadest distribution possible.\u201d \u2014 Mike Toutonghi\nEarly, unoptimized reports, reveal a likely optimized GPU performance level that could range from the low to the middle-high range of CPU price/performance, landing solidly on the low end of the same order of magnitude.\nThe algorithm leverages the features of modern CPUs, leaving other hardware such as GPU or FPGA, already advantaged in other ways, to do the same work using whatever optimizations developers of such software and hardware are able to achieve. For example, modern CPUs have higher clock speeds than FPGAs, highly integrated internal ASICs, and on-chip memory, the fastest being it\u2019s L1 Cache.\nBy designing VerusHash 2.0 such that it utilizes each of these advantages to run more efficiently, any device without them needs to find other ways to get those same efficiencies. Rather than explicitly attempting to block FPGAs or GPUs from functioning on the algorithm, the approach simply goes all out in leveraging efficiencies that CPUs can bring to the table, leaving FPGAs and GPUs to fend for themselves in other ways.\nBringing Mining into Balance\nVerusHash 2.0 is a result of something much deeper at the roots of the Verus project and in the principles of the founders, developers and community of Verus itself. You guessed it, decentralization and understanding truly what it is, why it\u2019s important, and how to implement it effectively. Decentralization is the principle that allows us to participate in consensus without the need for a trusted third or centralized party. It allows the people to have a voice that matters and makes a difference. It\u2019s not just a technical term to toss around or stick on a project to get the ratings.\nWithin the Verus project, decentralization is a foundational principle upon which the project, its fair launch, the technology, and the Verus community is built. If some group comes along looking to centralize in order to gain an unfair advantage, then the entire Verus community, as proven with VerusHash 2.0, is going to work to counter that centralization effort, in order to continue supporting a state of balance that works for everyone and which continues to favor decentralization.\nWhat Verus has achieved, with early numbers already in, is the creation of the first ever mining algorithm to fully equalize GPU performance with CPUs. There is still a great deal of optimization work in progress on GPUs in the community, but it is pretty clear that for VerusHash 2.0, GPUs will not dominate CPUs. The numbers on FPGAs are not in yet, as no one to my knowledge has completed an FPGA mining algorithm that works.\nThe results the community is seeing with GPUs, before optimization, strongly indicate that FPGAs, even if 20x more efficient than GPUs, will also not prevent CPUs from remaining viable miners on the Verus Coin network. Two FPGA companies have already expressed that they are working on implementation of the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm, so the great news is that VerusHash 2.0 is likely to also be the first ever field-proven solution to effective hardware equalization across current generations of today\u2019s best mining solutions.\nMine Your Own Verus Today!\nWant to start earning Verus with your PC?

Rolling out a Community Currency for broad use would still require some additional work on user-facing apps.\nThe Problem\nLike any other good, money is ruled by the laws of supply and demand. A currency in high use requires a constant float of supply to be circulating through its system. In the case of a fiat currency, the demand for holders to hold the currency gives it its value. In other words, as users of a currency, we collectively give value to that currency by our use. For something like the United States Dollar, its value comes from use in its domestic economy, as the global reserve currency, as the petrodollar, as the primary numeraire in financial markets, as the base currency for most foreign and corporate debt, as a predominant store of value, etc. etc. If we live in the United States and we zoom in, looking at our own local community, we can see that we are providing some small fraction of value to the overall value of the USD through our community\u2019s aggregate use and holdings. However small that might be in relation to the global forces of supply and demand, it might still be a relatively large amount of value when considered from the community\u2019s point of view. Little work has been done in quantifying this actual value provided by a community through its demand for a prevailing currency, but new technical tools might allow us to see this more clearly through actual experience. That\u2019s what this sample case study is about \u2014 let\u2019s call this value created by a community, \u201cCommunity Contributed Value\u201d.\nObserving this in the world today, the first thing we see is that, at the local level, we have zero control of our own Community Contributed Value, nor do we experience much, if any, local benefit from it. The aggregate of all Community Contributed Value, worldwide, is centralized in the hands of the US government. In the fiat period, as the master of the global reserve currency, the US government has proven that this aggregate value is enormous, allowing the government and country to run persistently high budget and trade deficits, and expand the money supply at will, while still maintaining a strong dollar.\nIn addition, although specific research is hard to find on this issue, it does seem as if powerful private forces that are adjacent to the United States Government, such as Wall Street and the Defense Industry, are conferred certain advantages through their proximity to the controller of the USD. Connected and powerful people and corporations may be, directly or indirectly, tapping into this Community Contributed Value.\nSolutions \u2014 pre-Blockchain\nAll of this is obvious enough to have given rise to a long history of efforts to start local community currencies, to keep some of this contributed value in the community. Prior to the development of the blockchain, these efforts really seem to have been doomed from the start. Currency issuance in the paper money world is difficult to control and has huge security and moral hazard issues (counterfeit, over-issuance, etc). These currencies cannot easily be made transparent, or auditable. The funds can\u2019t be reasonably saved or protected in banks. There is no plausible way to have readily available conversion at market rates between the community currency and the USD, nor is it plausible to keep a local currency at a stable and predictable value. For users, using community currency was hard, and for communities, making community currency was hard \u2014 and so, except for a handful (or less), every effort ran aground.\nSolutions \u2014 in the Dawn of the Blockchain Era\nInterest in community currencies perked up in the blockchain era, as it became clear that auditable, transparent tokens could be created at will (eg. ERC-20s), and the tokens could be securely stored and controlled through digital wallets. Bitcoin itself is an example of a type of community contributed value, where demand to use and hold gives it its value, to the benefit of a worldwide virtual community of early adopters. Ease of creation and use has been enhanced as against paper currencies, at least for the technically adept. Still, no longstanding successful cases of broad local community use have emerged. In fact some, such as CityCoins, have been notorious failures.\nIt seems that auditability, transparency and digital wallets are not enough. Other key issues are:\ncommunity currencies still require some sophisticated engineering capability to implement\nthere is no method for easy, reliable convertibility into the prevailing fiat currency, nor can conversion rates hope to be predictable or stable, even in the short term\nthere is no easy way to safely and measurably capture the Community Contributed Value\nthere are no additional enhancements to community or the currency through attached digital goods and a new digital goods economy\nNew Solutions \u2014 Bancor; Verus, public blockchains as a service\nIt is likely that, were these problems solved, and ease of digital wallet use addressed (along with personal privacy), motivated communities would find it far easier to bootstrap use of a community currency {\u201cCommCurr\u201d}. Imagine being able to spend your CommCurr anywhere in the community, from the babysitter to the gas station to the bank, and have it accepted with ease because the recipient knows that they can convert it easily and immediately, and without a counterparty, at the push of a button, to the USD, on a 1:1 basis (or very near thereabouts). And if community members could measurably observe the amount of Community Contributed Value that was emerging through widespread and persistent use, CommCurr would be easy to promote, and hard to resist.\nOne of the best efforts to deal with convertibility in community currencies is the project Bancor. They pioneered onchain reserves as part of a currency\u2019s definition, dynamically expanding and retracting supply, tied to use, and the ability to convert directly to and from other currencies, using locked onchain reserves as a fractional backing. This proof of concept has existed since the first version of Bancor, as a smart contract capability on Ethereum. For any community, each particular implementation of a smart contract would need to be designed, engineered and audited by experts, in this case Bancor developers. But Bancor is a heavily funded venture business at root, having raised hundreds of millions of dollars in an ICO. Development of community currencies doesn\u2019t pay, unlike commercially-driven defi, so Bancor soon abandoned any focus in this area.\nAt about the same time as Bancor emerged, former Microsoft fellow Michael Toutonghi, and some associates, released a vision paper focused on making public blockchain infrastructure that can be used by the world. Inspired by bitcoin\u2019s approach to re-imagining money, they aimed for the development of usable blockchain primitives that could form the basis of distributed network applications that provide people a real chance of self-sovereignty and new ways to self-organize in many areas of life.\nThey began developing software and protocols, basing off Bitcoin and Zcash, and bootstrapped a worldwide network of self-interested miners and stakers who power a network that is capable of providing public blockchain infrastructure. Fast forward five years, and a good portion of the network has been running for years, providing the first parts of the system. Now, the rest of the full vision (and more) is about to transition from testnet to mainnet, and new capabilities for blockchain are about to become publicly available, including the ability to run advanced Community Currency experiments that are virtually risk-free for communities, can be carried out at low cost, and have several elements that will make them attractive and safe for broad community use.\nTwo key points to note about the Verus protocols, software and network are:\nno venture capitalists or investors have been involved in its financing or development, so there is no need to extract rent or payment from users to pay back investors \u2014 it is rent-free technology, the only payments necessary are network fees to provide sufficient incentive for outsiders to provide their compute resources to power the network; and\nVerus does not use smart contracts \u2014 it is based on more traditional and longstanding distributed computing paradigms, and users access the software for basic primitives, which they then put into use and combine however they see fit. No contract programming or special blockchain engineering skill is required to carry out sophisticated actions. Recently, on the Verus testnet, one community member (a non-programmer) implemented a powerful community currency example in less than ten minutes with a few simple commands.\nCurrency Reserves \u2014 Convertibility\nVerus provides the ability to define new tokens/currencies at will, without programming. Various options are available, as tokens carry a multitude of possible uses, from voting to tickets to currencies. For community currency experiments, one of the key options is to lock in reserves that are attached to, and back the value of, the newly issued currency. And, since Verus is bridgeable to and from the Ethereum network, you could back a new currency with ethereum or USDC or any other valuable currency from that network.\nIf a CommCurr is defined with reserves backing it, then users can freely mint new currency by converting their USDC, for example, directly to CommCurr. This would build up the locked reserves of CommCurr. Or, they could go the other way around, converting CommCurr into USDC immediately by converting it into its reserves, without any need to find a counterparty. This would reduce the locked reserves. The conversion rate in these situations is driven by Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, similar to Uniswap, although providing a MEV-resistant fair conversion experience for all users at the lowest possible fees.\nReserve backing in the Verus protocols is user-selected upon the creation of a currency, ranging from a 5% backing to a 100% backing, Multiple currencies, with arbitrarily selected weights can be used. There is a requirement to use the Verus coin as at least one of the currencies backing CommCurr, or any currency \u2014 it needs to represent at least 5% of the backing. This is due to interoperability goals, to ensure that networks built using the Verus protocols stay connected, as a worldwide network of value, where currencies connect to each other throughout.\nThese few simple options make for a host of use cases, which will not all be explored here. Instead, we\u2019ll focus on CommCurr and note that a decent implementation might have backing consisting of two currencies \u2014 USD (represented by USDC bridged from the Ethereum network), and Verus, weighted 95:5 in favor of USD.\nAs a result of having valuable reserves, CommCurr is guaranteed to be valuable, and users can instantly convert in and out of it by simply sending it to themselves, or another person, choosing a conversion option. If a user sends USD and receives CommCurr then the reserves for USD will go up, and two things will happen to CommCurr \u2014 it will issue a little bit of new supply, and its value will go up. On the other hand, if a user goes the other way, sending CommCurr for USD, then some CommCurr supply will be automatically burned, and the value of CommCurr will decrease a little. In other words, CommCurr has a dynamically expanding and retracting supply, and a floating conversion rate, depending on the demand for the currency.\nCapturing the Contributed Value\nWhen creating CommCurr the best way to capture value for the community will be to create the currency so that it is only partially backed. For this sample case study, let\u2019s say it\u2019s backed at 80%. A community can easily engineer this precise amount of backing (which never changes, as a percentage, through the life of the currency) by choosing an initial supply of CommCurr, say 1 million, and then contributing 760,000 USD as reserves, and 40,000 dollars worth of Verus as reserves. We\u2019ll avoid going into detailed mechanics here but the result would be that, upon the launch of the currency, the community currency issuer would own 1,000,000 CommCurr, which is 80% backed by real value, but is convertible, as its initial price to acquire or to sell, 1:1 with the USD.\nNow, as we described above, if the issuer just starts converting their initial holdings of CommCurr (1 million units) into USD, they\u2019ll start depleting the reserves and driving down the value of the currency. In fact, if they just dumped it all, they\u2019d get all their initially contributed reserves back and the currency would be rendered virtually worthless. So, instead of doing that, they\u2019ll encourage use by the community. Perhaps they\u2019ll simply promote its use, or maybe they\u2019ll offer small discounts on community services, and encourage others to do so, to bootstrap use. The overall idea would be to encourage use by the community at large. If use emerges, and people start to acquire the currency (by contributing USD into the reserves), and the issuing community does not sell any of its initial holdings, the value of CommCurr will begin to creep up (provided that not all of this currency is immediately converted back by the recipients). Under these circumstances, It should be easy enough for community members to become comfortable with the value of CommCurr, as they see that it can always be acquired and disposed for USD, immediately, and at a predictable and stable price. It\u2019s important to note that if the issuing community doesn\u2019t sell/convert any of its holdings it is *impossible* that the value of CommCurr would fall below its initial value of 1:1 vis-a-vis the USD.\nIf regular use persists, there will be constant demand for the currency and a certain float will begin to remain in circulation. In our example, let\u2019s say the community reaches the point where 100,000 CommCurr is more or less always outstanding, in some form of transit circulating through, or being held by, the community. This would tend to increase the value of CommCurr some amount. But, instead of allowing the currency to appreciate, the Community could begin to draw down on some of the 1,000,000 of initial supply that it holds in its reserves. In fact, in this example, they\u2019d need to convert 100,000 of that supply into USD just to keep the price pegged 1:1 with the USD.\nSo now we would have an exact measure of Community Contributed Value \u2014 in this case it\u2019s 20% of $100,000 = $20,000. If the demand in the community created a persistent float of $1 million, the issuer could draw down their entire supply converting it into USD, and it would still be backed at its original amount, and still be convertible 1:1 with USD..\nNo Free Lunch (well, maybe a free appetizer)\nDid the issuer just make $1 million? No. Remember they had to commit $800,000 of value in the first place to set this up. And, although that investment is never at risk (they can always just convert everything into the reserves at any time to recoup them), there is a certain upfront capital cost there. However, they did clearly make $200,000, which, in this case would be a measurable amount of Community Contributed Value that they captured. There are also some minimal network costs to set this up on the Verus network, which is paid to the miners and stakers, as block rewards, for mining the Verus blockchain, and powering all the community\u2019s transactions. At current rates, it would amount to less than $200. Overall, the cost/risk/reward matrix is attractive.\nIt is important to remember that all of this is transparent and auditable, being on a public blockchain. Community members would be in instant possession of all relevant information about currency supplies, reserves, spending, conversion, etc. by the CommCurr creators.\nCommunity members would have transparency on their spending too, which is unfortunate. However, as a fork of zcash, Verus does offer private transactions on its native currency, Verus, and so there would be methods for users (or preferably, their apps) to help protect the spending privacy of community members.\nGovernance\nThere are other blockchain primitives that Verus enables which enhance CommCurr as an attractive and low-risk method to create Community Contributed Value. First, the protocols allow for virtually unlimited flexibility with respect to the governance of who is in control of the initial holdings of CommCurr. Multiple signatures could be required, up to, for example, 13 of 25, to authorize any spending or conversion activity. This would allow for fairly sophisticated approval mechanisms and safeguards for communities that are implementing this type of experiment.\nMoral Hazard \u2014 Escrow\nAnother blockchain primitive is the ability to provably and irrevocably lock digital wallets for an arbitrary period of time (up to 21 years). In this way, a community issuer could reduce concerns about the moral hazard of dumping their holdings and crushing the value of a growing CommCurr. They can choose to stagger escrows, making, say, 10% freely spendable now, and then unlocking 10% a year after that. One aspect to consider is that, if a lock is made irrevocable, it will build in capital cost risk for a community. Ie. if the experiment is a failure and there\u2019s no adoption, they wouldn\u2019t have access to their original capital until the unlock period passes.\nWait, There\u2019s More \u2014 Enhancing the Community Currency through New Capabilities for a Digital Goods Economy that Directly and Tangibly Benefits the Currency\nPossibly the most forward-thinking element of a Community Currency is the ability to build a real digital goods economy around it. The Verus protocols make this possible through the issuance of what are called SubIDs. SubIDs are multi-use friendly name \u201cidentities\u201d. Community members can register these names by paying a set amount of CommCurr, for example, 10 CommCurr per registration. This increases the value of CommCurr because any amounts paid for the \u201cidentities\u201d are burned, thus increasing the value of the currency for all holders thereof (including the original issuer).\nCommunity members might seek to register identities for many reasons:\nto signal support for the community\nto have a recognizable or branded community-oriented name to receive funds, eg. \u201cmember.CommCurr@\u201d\nto create a NFT or public profile attached to the name (\u201cidentities\u201d are capable of being expressed as nfts, artwork, public profiles, etc.)\nto be a ticket for an event or a discount code for purchases, or a membership in a club\nTo be attached to a physical item, like a community landmark, where it can represent a public profile or description, fundraiser, message board, etc.\nThese are just some of the virtually unlimited examples of digital goods that could be created, all of which would require CommCurr to acquire, this creating a real demand for the currency.\nConclusions\nThese are new blockchain capabilities. They do not currently exist on Ethereum or other smart contract blockchains because the interplay of such different elements would seem to create overwhelming complexity, requiring the use of multiple inter-operating contracts to implement. Certainly, such comprehensive and flexible solutions could not be carried out in minutes through the use of a few simple commands.\nCurrently, all of these capabilities exist in the Verus protocols and are in use on testnet. A mainnet activation is imminent, and communities can soon start to experiment, at the smallest initial scales they desire. It\u2019s important to note, however, that additional software development would be required to make some of these elements easy and safe to use for the broader community. As a FOSS project, Verus encourages communities to work together, and with the Verus developer community to create open source apps that leverage the protocols, so that all communities worldwide can benefit from the resulting development.\nDiscuss and explore all Verus has to offer on Discord\nFollow on Twitter\nGo to verus.io\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: Verus on the Spirit of Open Source, Community and Contributing to Crypto as a Whole\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-on-the-spirit-of-open-source-community-and-contributing-to-crypto-as-a-whole-5dad716ac60c\nContent:\n\nVerus on the Spirit of Open Source, Community and Contributing to Crypto as a Whole\nWhat Open Source and Collaboration Means to Verus and How Verus is Contributing Back Upstream to the Komodo Ecosystem\n\nBefore developing and releasing Verus, one of the most important decisions to make was a path towards building a blockchain capable of delivering on the Verus vision. By choosing Komodo as a starting point from which to develop its technology, the Verus project joined a vibrant ecosystem of independent, decentralized projects that work together, are willing to help each other, and cooperate by building on each others contributions to a common, or sometimes even just similar, code base.\nInnovation in Cooperation\nFrom the beginning of our development Komodo\u2019s lead developer, JL777, offered help and advice as we dove into the Komodo technology and code. This fast tracked our understanding of Komodo\u2019s core, helping us best leverage the Komodo technology and improve it through our own enhancements and invention, needed to launch the Verus main net.\nThis spirit of a cooperating, decentralized, and independent open source community has helped Verus achieve the goals we have to date and laid a foundation for the journey ahead.\nOpen Source and Innovation\nWe are an open source project. We believe that through development, open source, and mutual sharing of inventions and technology with others we can all build stronger systems for the betterment of society. This model allows each project and community to maintain their own vision, as we collectively develop solutions that are greater than the sum of their parts.\nIt is in this spirit that we upstream some of our hard work and technologies, in gratitude for the technology and support that Komodo provided at our inception, for use by all projects across the Komodo ecosystem.\nWhat is Being Shared Upstream\nThis upstream sharing includes the integration of Sapling with Komodo features and crypto conditions, VerusPoS, VerusHash, Timelocks for coinbase emissions, and advanced emission schedules.\nWhat is Remaining Unique to Verus\nThe Verus Project will continue development of its enhanced crypto conditions and work with Komodo towards a common model. Proof of Power and Stake Guard have not been upstreamed at this time and will remain unique to Verus Coin until integrated independently by Komodo, during another upstream in the future, or by other open source efforts.\nStrength in Community and Collaboration\nWe\u2019ve seen and even been part of a lot of history in recent months, and we see major changes in crypto now and on the horizon. We started as a fair launch project in a decentralized ecosystem, not an ICO, not a funding event or premine. Komodo is one of the few ecosystems, if not the only, where independent blockchain projects strong on technology can find a home and a way to collaborate.\nWe\u2019ve made huge technological progress, solved some critical problems to enable the security needed for public blockchains as a service, and with your help we have built an incredible, growing Verus community of its own. We believe this upstream contribution is the right thing to do and will be good for Verus, as it is good for Komodo.\nThrough this, as in other things, we are pleased to contribute to the advancement of crypto as a whole.\nGet involved in Verus and the Verus community\nVisit https://veruscoin.io\nDiscord https://discord.gg/VRKMP2S\nResources\nHow to Update or Install Verus GUI Enhanced Agama Wallet\nVerus Coin v0.4.0 Official Release Notes\nHow Verus Solved Nothing at Stake and Weak Subjectivity for Proof of Work\nEverything You Need to Know About the Zcash Sapling Upgrade\nBen\u2019s Pocket Guide to VerusCoin for Dummies and Smart People\nKomodo Ecosystem Spotlight: Verus Coin\nKomodo AMA Spotlights VerusCoin\nFormation of The Verus Coin Foundation with a Vision of PBaaS\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: Discord\u2019s Session Hijack Vulnerability and Verus Community\u2019s Response\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/discords-session-hijack-vulnerability-and-verus-community-s-response-c2e9238ca08a\nContent:\n\n\nDiscord\u2019s Session Hijack Vulnerability and Verus Community\u2019s Response\nCOPY FROM BELOW THIS LINE TO VERIFY SIGNATURE BELOW\nOne of the first and most important things to announce is that no funds on the Verus network or in Verus wallets were compromised due to this attack, as they were not subject to the vulnerabilities this hacker group exploited. We hope that the hackers were unable to fool anyone into giving up the funds from their Metamask or other Web wallets and that the criminals\u2019 efforts resulted in a negative return.\nThis should be a cautionary tale for any communities using Discord, and we will detail what we experienced, in hopes that it might prevent another Discord community from experiencing the same or similar issues. The hackers used a Discord session hijack vulnerability that is currently in use across some notorious hacking groups along with social engineering to inflict significant damage on the Discord server where the Verus community spends much of its time when coordinating. These attacks had no effect on the Verus network, and although the hackers did get control of the Discord server, they did not need to get full control or credentials for any account to inflict their damage on the Discord server. We believe the attack could easily have been cut short immediately if Discord could improve their false positive account disablement as well as their response time to critical support requests.\nWhat we have determined so far:\n1. The group targeted me and worked to establish trust as journalists for weeks, always persistent, never pushy. After working with me on an article, where I contributed the following content (Verus Article from Hack).\n2. After they said they had completed their article, they worked for 2 days on getting me to accept a content release form, even rewriting it after I refused to agree to their first version.\n3. Once they rewrote it, I clicked a link from their Discord server, and although they weren\u2019t able to get login credentials, they exploited a session hijack link, and immediately went to work.\n4. After they had my account, which had setup the Discord server so many years ago, under their control, they kicked off all admins, installed their own admins, and did something that Discord would have to help explain that got Discord to instantly ban my account, the only one besides Discord that could have kicked them off.\n5. Since then, they started announcing scam links, claiming fraudulent giveaways with Ethereum tokens backed by Verus on websites that if someone with a Metamask or similar wallet engages with, there is a risk of taking assets from them on Ethereum or possibly other networks, not Verus.\n6. We still have not heard from or gotten help from Discord Support since this event began, except that they banned my account, and to our knowledge the scammers are still in the old Verus Discord server attempting to scam an ever dwindling group of members who haven\u2019t left by now.\n7. If you know anyone in the old Discord, please inform them to leave the Discord asap and not engage in any of the announcements, as they are made by impersonators, while people trying to warn are banned and the original admins are locked out of the server.\n8. My old Discord ID is now disabled by Discord, and I no longer have access to our conversations. My new account is miketout.vrsc (this ID), which is not the owner of this Discord, and we have implemented a set of processes for all Discord admins to prevent any such event from occurring again.\nSince the Verus Community is much more than a Discord Server, though we still haven\u2019t found a more suitable engagement platform for the way the community works, a number of people have worked to create and secure a new community Discord Server, and we welcome all Verus Community members and well meaning interested people to join.\nThough we are still hoping to have a conversation with Discord about the hack and how they could improve their security to prevent this for all of their user communities in the future, we have taken steps independently to harden the Verus Discord community in a way that would prevent such an attack in the future, even if the link click session hijack exploit is not resolved. We also have even better security thoughts for the future around leveraging VerusID in easy, meaningful ways. If you have experience writing Discord bots and especially secure servers, please get in touch. Until then, we hope you will rejoin or join the Verus Community\u2019s Discord server and the worldwide, unlimited scale, fully decentralized blockchain protocol conversation.\nGet an invite for the new Verus Discord Community Server: https://verus.io/discord\nCOPY UNTIL THE END OF THE LINE ABOVE THIS ONE\nThis article is signed by my ID, mike@ on the Verus network with the following signature:\nAX8OKwABQSBhYU0ShQsu6LSRVay8IY7avMhoy3ub8jhznZnlhD5nGRE4h4U5MEWiPg+DXGJRSXd3bWou5TfNHn/zEPfbMA7d\n(if you are using Safari or possibly another browser, you may need this signature, as the copy comes out a bit different):\nAZAOKwABQSCaekvVN3CBbneot9AHby8S0+YCYevJDSfps3iaML8BF0j9PMdO/37JYxHbuDy/R11hWe9tCI5AInjppcQhQ3hD\nYou can verify my signature on any Verus node or lite mode API, by copying the article between the instructions above and entering the ID as mike@ and the signature above to check.

Use it to switch between Verus and the different stablecoins. Or hold it while it accrues value from conversion fees.\n\n\u23f1\ufe0f Switch is launched on block: 2,984,851 (Saturday 30 March, 2024).\n\ud83d\udd01 Convert VRSC, DAI, USDC or EURC to Switch, or vice versa. Or use Switch as an AMM and convert the reserves with each other.\n\u2753 USDC & EURC are stablecoins issued by Circle. DAI is a USD stablecoin issued by Maker.\n\ud83d\udcb8 Low-cost, MEV-resistant DeFi conversions with max. fees of 0.05%.\n\u2328\ufe0f See the Switch statistics (protocol prices, amount in reserves) at Cryptodashboard or verus.trading. Or type in /switch in the #trading channel in the community Discord.\n\ud83d\udcda Learn in this article how to convert the stables with each other, and how to convert to and from Switch. Also you learn how to bridge EURC or USDC to the Verus network.\nWhat is Switch?\nSwitch is a decentralized currency on the Verus blockchain. It is fully (100%) backed by its reserves. Its initial supply is 20,000 Switch.\nIts reserves are weighted as follows: VRSC (16%), DAI DAI.vETH (21%), USDC vUSDC.vETH (21%) & EURC EURC.vETH (42%). What does this mean? E.g. when you put EURC in the reserves you get more Switch after preconversion than when you put VRSC in.\nUse Switch to convert between any of the reserves for a max. fee of 0.05%. Switch is a MEV-resistant AMM. Learn more about Verus DeFi.\nSwitch accrues 50% of the conversion fees \u2014 the conversion fees stay in the reserves, increasing the value of Switch.\nThe other 50% of the conversion fees go to the miners and stakers of Verus.\nThere is a risk to holding Switch \u2014 USDC & EURC are distributed by the centralized company Circle.\nThe supply of Switch is dynamic. Switch gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETHor EURC.vETH, and get burned when people convert back to the reserves.\n\nRegister subIDs\u2014 *.Switch@ for a 10 EURC (in Switch) fee. Those fees get burned. Learn more about subIDs (VerusIDs).\nSwitch is perfect to use with VerusPay \u2014 Get your local businesses to take DAI, USDC & EURC on Verus. If you hold VRSC, DAI, or USDC and need to buy coffee in EURC, just scan a QR code! Verus scales to everyone worldwide and auto-converts payments from your favorite currency for always low transaction fees & a 0.05% conversion fee.\nThere was a preconversion period for Switch\nThere was a 7-day preconversion period where the reserves of Switch were filled with VRSC, DAI DAI.vETH, USDC vUSDC.vETH & EURC EURC.vETH. Depending on how much people added they got their fair share of the 20,000 Switch after the 7 day period.\nAfter the 7-day period Switch became a MEV-resistant AMM. All reserves can now be converted between each other.\n\nHow to bridge USDC & EURC over to Verus\nUSDC and EURC are ERC-20 token stablecoins issued by Circle. Get them on Coinbase or other exchanges. On the Verus blockchain they are called vUSDC.vETH & EURC.vETH.\nDAI DAI.vETH is readily available on the Verus network. Below are the ERC-20 token contracts for the tokens:\nUSDC token contract\nEURC token contract\nDAI token contract\nTo be able to use those ERC-20 tokens to preconvert into Switch they need to be bridged to the Verus blockchain. The bridging is done through the non-custodial and trustless Verus-Ethereum Bridge. Bridging and preconverting can be done with Verus Mobile, Verus Desktop (full node) & MetaMask with the bridge website.\nVerus Mobile bridging\nLet\u2019s start by bridging with Verus Mobile. First thing to do is to add the ERC-20s in Verus Mobile. This is how to do it:\nAdding ERC-20s to Verus Mobile.\nPress the plus-button bottom-right corner\nPress \u201cAdd ERC-20 Token\u201d\nSelect checkmark to \u201cFind using mapped PBaaS currency\u201d, and fill in eurc.veth, vusdc.veth or dai.veth. Then press Continue.\nPress OK when a warning screen pops up.\nNow you are ready to receive USDC, EURC or DAI (as ERC-20s) on Verus Mobile.\nBefore bridging the tokens over to Verus let\u2019s add the currencies on the Verus blockchain to the wallet:\nAdding the currencies on the Verus blockchain on Verus Mobile.\nPress the plus-button bottom-right corner.\nPress \u201cAdd PBaaS currency\u201d.\nFill in eurc.veth, vusdc.veth or dai.veth and press continue.\nPress \u201cADD\u201d.\nNow we are ready to bridge the ERC-20s over to the Verus blockchain.\nBridging EURC to Verus. It will come out as EURC.vETH.\nSelect the ERC-20 you want to bridge. (In the example we use EURC).\nPress \u201cSend\u201d and then \u201cConvert or cross-chain\u201d.\nPress \u201cSend off-chain\u201d.\nAs the recipient address fill in a Verus address you own (R- or i-address, or VerusID).\nFill in the amount you want to bridge over.\nThen as \u201cSelect network to send to\u201d choose Verus\nThen as \u201cSelect currency to receive as\u201d choose EURC.vETH\nThat\u2019s it.

I\u2019ll keep things short and to the point.\n\nVerus Wins \u2018Inspiration Award\u2019 From Fidelity\u2019s Center for Applied Technology\nVerus was selected as 1 of 7 finalists, and chosen from hundreds of tech disruptors across Europe. Mike Toutonghi received the award after presenting Verus at a TED Talk-style event in Dublin. It is exciting to see Fidelity and Dogpatch recognize the innovation that the Verus Protocol delivers to the world.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Read More On the Exciting Win\n\nThe developers are working hard towards mainnet before Consensus 2022. In the meantime, new testnet features are on the horizon that will enable more powerful decentralized usecases.\nSimplified and improved ID privacy by adding \u201csource of funds\u201d address to registration, enabling a specific ID or z-address to be used for the funds to prepare and register an identity.\nAdvanced sub-ID registration for decentralized identities with new business models, semi-centralized identities for voting and other purposes, and centralized identities that can be issued and sold via centralized currencies.\nDecentralized fractional currencies can issue identities, depending on their parameters, and the person getting such an ID pays the blockchain identity import fee in native currency as well as the specified fee in the currency issuing the ID. The issuing currency fee is burned, benefitting all holders of the issuing currency by reducing supply by the fee amount and leaving the same reserves, raising conversion rates. Centralized currencies, whether fractional, token, or even native, issue identities and the fees are paid to the controlling ID of the currency, not burned.\nNew \u201crequires permission\u201d and \u201creferral required\u201d issuance is supported. If this is specified as an option in an ID issuing currency definition, which may still be a decentralized issuer, the identity registration transaction must be counter-signed by either the ID of the issuing currency (\u201crequires permission\u201d) or a valid referrer (\u201creferral required\u201d) which either is the issuing currency ID or an unrevoked ID with the same parent as the new identity. The identity registration command and API will enforce this and create transactions that must be signed in this manner.\nSeparate pricing, referral namespaces, and referral levels for all identity namespaces are supported (ie. only *.fanclub@ can refer for name.fanclub@).\nPricing of sub-IDs for a fractional currency can be either in the currency itself or denominated in any of its reserves (eg. USD, VRSC, EUR, etc.) to enable compatibility with ID-based rights licensing or royalty streams priced in any currency.\nGateway registration for centralized or decentralized non-name controller gateways (the ETH bridge, for example) that allow issuance of, for example, mike.veth@, priced in USD, and paid in Bridge.VETH.\nCreation of \u201cmapped currencies\u201d using the gateway registered IDs, such as BAT.vETH mapped to Ethereum BAT, for example. Normal sub-IDs cannot create currencies, but this is enabled for gateways that are not name controllers to provide them with services that would be harder for them to write than use from Verus.\n\nNew Verus Desktop Features\nIn the upcoming new Verus Desktop release, the Multiverse-tab has been revamped and you\u2019ll be able to get insights into the blockchain economics and easier ways to search for currencies.\nTestnet visualization.\nAnother added feature is that you can visualize the network to see the connections between all the blockchains, bridges and currencies.\nTwo Videos Where Mike Toutonghi Talks About Verus\n\n\nAwesome Community Mining Rigs\nThese are publicly shared mining rigs by community members in the Verus Discord.

The intention is that anyone can follow this, regardless of your skill level or knowledge, and be mining and earning Verus Coin today.\nYou can learn more about this 100% community project at https://veruscoin.io. The project had no ico, no premine, was a completely \u201cfair launch\u201d which means everyone got the source code to begin mining it at the same time as the developers themselves, through an announcement over at bitcointalk.\nImplementing \u201cProof of Power\u201d, a new hybrid 50% PoW/50% PoS consensus mechanism, Verus Coin is a provable 51% hash attack immune blockchain, and solves the Nothing at Stake and weak subjectivity problems\u2026all in a decentralized manner!\nOkay, let\u2019s get you mining!\nPart 1 \u2014 Get a VRSC Wallet Address\nYou\u2019ll be mining Verus Coin directly into your own wallet. So you need a wallet address!\nYou can run a \u201cNative Node\u201d wallet, which synchronizes with the entire Verus blockchain and is a cool way to participate in the network, but does take a bit longer to sync up. Or you can run in \u201cLite\u201d mode where you get a new Verus wallet address that uses Electrum servers to connect you to the network, so you don\u2019t have to do a full sync.\nFor this guide, we\u2019ll do Lite mode since it\u2019s the fastest and we want to get mining in less than 5 minutes.\nStep 1\nFirst download the version for your OS of the enhanced Verus Agama wallet from https://veruscoin.io/#download\nStep 2\nUnzip the compressed folder to your Desktop or somewhere you can easily launch it from. I recommend renaming the folder to \u201cVerus v0.5.x\u201d where \u201cx\u201d is the current version, that way you keep track which version you\u2019re running.\nStep 3\nLaunch the Agama app located within the folder and upon the first screen, use the drop down under \u201cLite (SPV) Mode\u201d to select VRSC, then choose \u201cCreate new wallet\u201d:\n\n\nStep 4\nNext, you\u2019ll see that a new Wallet Seed has been created for you. Simply copy it and save it somewhere secure (I also recommend writing it down!). Anyone with that Seed can access your wallet, so security is key. Paste it or type it into the Confirm Wallet Seed section, then scroll down and optionally create a Password to encrypt your new Seed into a file for easy logins..the password is created in \u201cEnter your key\u201d..finally name it something unique and click \u201cRegister\u201d\n\n\nStep 5\nNow you can login using the Password you just created, once signed in you\u2019ll find your new Public Verus Coin Wallet Address (VRSC Address) at the top of the screen as seen below. Copy this public address and have it ready for Part 2 below.\n\n\nPart 2 \u2014 Setup the Pool Miner\nNow that you have a Verus Coin public address, you\u2019re ready to begin mining VRSC to it! This guide shows you how to start mining using \u201cpool mining\u201d where you mine on one of the Verus pools and receive payouts based on your hash power contribution and the payout schedule of the pool you\u2019re mining with.\nGetting Familiarized with Pool Settings (it\u2019s easy)\nHere\u2019s a list of Verus pools (I\u2019ll try to keep this updated, but for a complete list visit https://veruscoin.io/#download):\nLuck Pool: luckpool.net/verus/\n52 Hash Pool: vrsc.52hash.com\nGinasis Mining Pool: vrsc.ginasismining.com\nJeepool: vrsc.jeepool.com\nLOUD Mining Pool: vrsc.loudmining.com\nRegardless which pool you choose to mine with you\u2019ll need two things from their site: The Stratum Host and The Port\nIf they show something like pool.vrsc.52hash.com:18888 that means the host is \u201cpool.vrsc.52hash.com\u201d and the port is \u201c18888\u201d\nOkay, let\u2019s begin!\nStep 1\nSimply visit your chosen pool site and copy down the Host and Port. Following are the five community Verus pools you can choose from and where you would find the Host and Port for each:\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice above that some pools have multiple Hosts or Ports to choose from. In the case of LuckPool you can choose the ideal Host and Port for your region and hardware type. Others, such as 52Hash, have a different Host and Port for the level of hash power you anticipate on mining with.\nStep 2\nNow that you have the host and port, you need the Verus pool miner! You can download the latest version of Nheqminer at https://veruscoin.io/#download from the \u201cMiners\u201d section, for your OS as seen here:\n\nSimply unzip the compressed folder to your Desktop or somewhere easy to access, then open the folder and use a text editor to edit the \u201cstart\u201d file within.\nStep 3\nCustomize the top section of the start script file with the pool Host and Port you\u2019ve decided to use, your Verus Coin public address you copied earlier, an optional \u201cworker name\u201d (useful if you are going to mine from many devices, so you can track how each is doing), and lastly, with a number representing how many \u201cThreads\u201d you want your system to mine with. You can find out how many threads your CPU has by doing a simple Google search.\nAfter entering the custom data into the start file, be sure to save it!\n\nPart 3 \u2014 Begin Mining!\nNow that you have your wallet and your start script is configured with it, along with the pool and thread settings, you\u2019re ready to mine! This part scares a lot of people, because you\u2019re running a \u201ccommand line\u201d script. But it\u2019s no sweat, I promise.\nStep 1\nOpen the folder containing the start script (or maybe it\u2019s still open) and, in Linux, right click inside the folder. From the drop down menu that appears, simply click \u201cOpen in Terminal\u201d. (In Windows simply open the folder containing the start.bat file.)\nOn a Mac, click Finder, Services, and select \u201cNew Terminal at Folder\u201d.\nStep 2\nNow simply run the start script!\nIn Windows you can simply double click the \u201cstart.bat\u201d file. Windows may give you a security warning, to bypass it click \u201cMore info\u201d and then \u201cRun Anyway\u201d. If you run into an error in Windows regarding a missing DLL, try installing the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3.\nIn Mac and Linux you\u2019ll run the \u201cstart.sh\u201d script as follows:\n\nStep 3\nYou\u2019ll see the script kick off and start mining! Leave the window open to mine. If you want to shut down the script, in Linux and Mac press CTRL + Z while the terminal is in focus.\nOn Windows press CTRL + C and then Y to terminate.\n\nStep 4\nLastly, if you want to see the status of your workers (or just single worker if you\u2019re only using one computer to mine), visit the pool mining site where you\u2019ve chosen to mine and find their Worker Stats section. For example, here are two different pools and their Stats sections (LuckPool on the left, Ginasis on the right):\n\n\nPart 4 \u2014 Optional: Become a \u2018Hans Solo\u2019\u2026Miner That Is!\nPool mining is a great way to participate in the distributed securing of a blockchain while earning rewards often sooner and more regularly than \u201csolo mining\u201d. Whether solo or pool mining however, ultimately the results should be about the same as far as coins earned.\nSolo Mining doesn\u2019t have to be \u201csolo\u201d either! You can split your computer power, mining solo AND pool simultaneously. Whether using just CPU power, or a combination of CPU and GPU, running the pool miner and Agama side by side is no problem!\nTo learn how to Solo Mine using Verus enhanced Agama, check out my step-by-step guide here:\nHow to Earn VRSC Solo Mining with Your CPU and Staking Mined Coins!\nEasy step by step guide to CPU solo mining Verus Coin (VRSC) on your computer using the Verus Agama wallet + How to\u2026medium.com\nJoin the Verus Community\nYou are now mining, helping secure the Verus blockchain, and earning VRSC! What next?\nBesides the incredible strong development, delivering cutting edge technology and ground breaking innovations (learn more about it here), Verus is a 100% community project and has a thriving and active Discord. Whether you need help or want to find ways to contribute (and earn more Verus!) joining the official Verus Discord is a great next step!\nHope you found this guide helpful and as simple and easy to follow as I intended.

The Verus coin, VRSC, is a CPU Mineable coin which utilizes VerusHash, the fastest cryptographic hash algorithm in the world. It can be mined on x64 CPUs which has significantly leveled the playing field with GPUs.\nBecause Verus is a fork of Komodo, it comes with the same first in class security features, such as dPoW\u2026a form of Proof of Work that essentially \u201cbacks up\u201d the blockchain to the most secure blockchain in the world, presently Bitcoin. However, chains forked from Komodo can notarize to Komodo\u2019s blockchain. This allows them double the protection against attacks while giving them the effect of instant security, as if they were as mature as the blockchains they are backing up to (notarizing to).\nAlso a part of the package with Komodo comes zk-SNARK privacy. Komodo was a fork from ZCash and has the same level of privacy built into its blockchain. You can learn more about zk-SNARK and zCash here.\nUnlike Komodo, Verus implements a combination of PoW and PoS (Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, respectively). This is a 50/50 split in which half the blocks are mined by mining and the other half by staking. Mining and Staking is done using a modified version of the Agama wallet by the Verus team. There is a GUI (graphical) wallet and a CLI (command line) wallet. Mining can also be done via pools and using ccminer software modified to work with Verus.\nStaking is as simple as holding a balance in an online wallet. Mining can be done using a modern CPU or GPU and done directly (where winning a block gives you the entire block reward) or through a pool.\nYou can read more and learn more about Verus at their official site here or join their Discord!\nIt\u2019s a very fun, development rich, and ambitious project. In my opinion one of the few projects I see going the long run, with legitimate, ingenuous, and innovative development and strong roots in some of the most influential and talented developers and leaders in cryptocurrency/blockchain today\u2026including Lead Developer Michael J Toutonghi, Microsoft\u2019s former VP and Technical Fellow and the founder and architect of the .Net platform.\nBefore You Begin\nBefore getting into the steps, it\u2019s a good idea to join the Verus community and really educate yourself in their FAQ in Discord, read the Vision Paper at least\u2026if not the Whitepaper, and just overall familiarize yourself with the project and how mining and staking work.\nIn this guide I\u2019m assuming you already know the basics about how staking works, but I may mention a few of these basics along the way for clarification or as a reminder. While you don\u2019t have to be an expert at command line or linux to use this guide or follow the steps, just keep in mind that you should always test before doing something major. And always make backups. I\u2019ll mention this again along the way.\nOkay, let\u2019s get started!\nPart One \u2014 Setup Accounts\nIt\u2019s important to have a highly secured and encrypted email, that no one knows, which you\u2019ll be able to use for backing up your wallet file and to setup all other secure accounts for your Verus staking tasks.\nProtonMail\nPersonally I recommend using ProtonMail and setting the encryption to the Highest while setting up your account. Do this from a device you know for certain is secure, not a public or shared computer.\nProtonMail has a Two Factor Authentication option, which I recommend turning on. You\u2019ll need to use either Google Authenticator or Authy for generating 2FA codes. Make sure you secure this app! If you use Authy make sure to password protect the app and ensure that \u201cAllow Multi-device\u201d is disabled for maximum security.\nDigital Ocean\nNext, you\u2019ll need a DigitalOcean account in which we\u2019ll be setting up the \u201cDroplet\u201d server. I recommend using the new secure email you setup and once you\u2019ve got your account setup, turn 2FA on within your DigitalOcean settings as well.\nDigitalOcean Droplets are VM Servers that are fast and easy to deploy and can be scaled up or down. In this guide I\u2019m showing you how to setup a very basic, small (1vCPU/1GB RAM) droplet which is only $5 a month.\nBecause it\u2019s such a small server with very limited resources, there are a few things we\u2019ll be doing which a \u201cnormal\u201d server would not require. Latest Sapling activation makes it a breeze to use a minimal server tasks, such as shielding and private transactions, which used to take several minutes\u2026now are near 1 second and even faster!\nNow that you have a new shiny email and Digital Ocean account, everything is secured, it\u2019s time to setup your droplet.\nPart Two \u2014 Create The Droplet\nStep 1\nFrom the top right of your dashboard in DigitalOcean, click the Create button and then select \u201cDroplets\u201d\n\nStep 2\nAt the next screen click the down arrow under the Ubuntu block and select 16.04.4 x64 to use the Ubuntu 16.04 Server Image\n\nStep 3\nScroll down and under the \u201cChoose a size\u201d section, select the top size under Standard Droplets which includes 1GB of RAM, 1vCPU and 25 GB of disk space\n\nStep 4\nNext, choose a region for the data-center your droplet will be installed in. For Verus I recommend Frankfurt or a similar region that is close to the Verus nodes. A ping from Frankfurt to a node IP is 40ms when compared to SFO at about 180ms\n\nStep 5\nNext create a hostname for your new droplet. This will be the hostname to the server itself internally. You can also setup Tags if you plan on having many Droplets down the road and want an easy way to organize and find the one you\u2019re looking to do maintenance on, etc.\nThen simply click Create!\n\nStep 6\nTo see and manage your Droplet(s), when you login simply click \u201cDroplets\u201d from the left menu bar under Manage. Your Droplets will show up to the right and you can see a quick status or click on one for more management options\n\nNow that you\u2019ve created a Droplet, you will receive an email from Digital Ocean containing the IP address and root password for accessing your new droplet. You can also access the Droplet from the Management screen in your Digital Ocean account by clicking the Droplet, then clicking Console in the upper right. This opens a new console window, which looks just like a terminal window.\nPart Three \u2014 Configure The Droplet\nNow that the droplet is setup and online, you\u2019ll want to configure it for use as your Verus staking server. Following are my recommendations and in my opinion, the best practices.\nStep 1 \u2014 New Root Password\nSet a new root password straight away! To do this, login to your new droplet using the Console from the Management within your Digital Ocean account using the root password emailed to you. Your droplet will prompt you to reset your password (create a new one). Use a highly secure and complex password that you do not use elsewhere.\nStep 2 \u2014 Setup SSH\nNext, setup SSH to use your SSH Key for logging into your Droplet (instead of password authentication). If you don\u2019t know how, follow this guide: How to Add SSH Keys to Your Droplet.\nBefore removing root SSH privilege, follow the next step to create a new account in your Droplet.\nStep 3 \u2014 Setup New Secure User Account\nNext, you need to setup a new user account in the Droplet which will run Verus and be your access to the system, so root is not used for access.\nHere are the steps to create a new user account, give it \u201csudo\u201d privileges, test it and disable root SSH:\nYou\u2019ll create the new user account with: adduser username make sure to change username to the username you want to use for this account. You\u2019ll have prompts for Full Name, etc\u2026but the only important thing is setting the secure password for this account. Make it as secure as your root password!\nAfter the user account is created, give it sudo privileges with: \nusermod -aG sudo username again, replace username with the username you created.\nNext, log off the server and test that you can SSH using the new user account.\nIf it went well, it will login fine and you can now remove root SSH privilege:\n- Open the sshd_config file as sudo to edit:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n- Under the #Authentication section find the line \u201cPermitRootLogin\u201d and change the \u201cyes\u201d to a \u201cno\u201d\n- Save the changes with CTRL+O and exit nano with CTRL+X\nRestart your server with: sudo reboot\nStep 4 \u2014 Setup Larger Swap\nAlthough latest Verus Sapling upgrade makes shielding screaming fast and non-intensive on resources, to make this minimal system a little more \u201crobust\u201d, I recommend you give it a good sized Swap, as it only has 1GB RAM. We\u2019ll set a 4GB Swap.\nHere\u2019s how to do that, very simple and no reboot required.\nFirst we\u2019ll create the Swap file with: sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile\nNow that it\u2019s created, we need to enable it by doing a couple things:\n- First set permissions to root only: sudo chmod 600 /swapfile \n- Next, mark the file as swap with: sudo mkswap /swapfile \n- Last, we\u2019ll enable the file with: sudo swapon /swapfile\nThe Swap is on and we need to make it permanent, so it\u2019s used after any reboot or new session. To do this, we need to edit the /etc/fstab file, which can be dangerous so first we\u2019ll back it up. Do the following:\n- Backup the /etc/fstab file with: sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bk \n- Now we\u2019ll add the swap info to /etc/fstab with the following: \necho '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\nNow, we need to edit a couple Swap settings for best performance. You can change these and test different settings, here are my settings that seem to work pretty well.\n- First is Swappiness, a Desktop usually uses a higher setting and a Server a lower, mine is set to 40. This is set by editing the /etc/sysctl.conf file: sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf \nAt the end of the file, add the following: vm.swappiness=40 \n- Next is Cache Pressure, a Server can do with a lower number, for example 50. This is also added to the /etc/sysctl.conf file at the end, first edit the file with sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf and add the following to the end of the file: vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50\nAfter these settings are applied and the file saved, reboot your server and verify after the reboot that your swap is on and showing as 4GB by issuing the following command: free -m which will output showing your RAM and SWAP.\nPart Four \u2014 Install Verus and Begin Staking\nStep 1\u2014 Setup Server Environment\nWe will be simply unpacking a pre-built package of Verus on this system but still need a few dependencies and I recommend installing the tools necessary to build in the future, should you need these.\nUpdate with sudo apt update\nInstall tools and dependencies with:\nsudo apt --yes install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-openssl-dev bsdmainutils automake curl\nNext we\u2019ll setup email functionality for your server. \n- Install mailutils with: sudo apt install mailutils During this install you\u2019ll be prompted a few times, just choose the defaults on each screen.\n- Edit your /etc/postfix/main.cf file to enable TLS Encryption and set localhost. Edit the file with: sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf Locate the TLS section of the file and add the following lines: \nsmtp_tls_security_level=encrypt\n smtp_tls_loglevel = 1 \n- Now, near the end of the file, locate the line \u201c inet_interfaces = any\u201d and change it to inet_interfaces = localhost \n- Finally, restart your postfix service with:\n sudo systemctl restart postfix \nWARNING: While you may want to use email for alerts, such as telling you when a new block is mined or alerting if the services goes down (I have scripts below that will do these things) only use email for backing up your wallet.dat file if you know what you\u2019re doing and understand how to ensure your emails are secure.\nStep 2: Install Verus\nOkay, now that you\u2019ve installed the build tools and dependencies, it\u2019s time to get Verus Coin. If you followed the previous steps precisely, things should run smoothly from this point, but if you run into any issues feel free to hit me up on the Verus Discord. My Discord ID is JohnWestbrook#1979.\nGet the latest version of Verus Coin for Linux:\nLogged in as your new secure user account, start in your Home folder with cd ~ and download the latest version of VerusCoin. Using a browser you can get the exact download like for Linux at VerusCoin Official GitHub. I\u2019ll try to keep this guide updated.\nThe latest CLI version as of now (Jun 26, 2019) is 0.5.7\u20132\nYou can download it in your server by issuing the following command (change to the most recent version if necessary):\nwget https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/download/v0.5.7-2/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.5.7-2.tar.gz\nUnpack the tar file with the following command: tar -xvf Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.5.7-2.tar.gz\nVerusCoin is now unpacked and inside the verus-cli directory within your home folder.\nNow we need to download the Zcash Params. This may take several minutes. To do so issue the following command: ./verus-cli/fetch-params\nStep 3: Start Verus and Allow Sync Time\nYou\u2019re now ready to start Verus! The first time you start it may take time to sync up. Optionally you can start with the Bootstrap.\nTo do so, follow these simple steps\u2026\nSteps to BootStrap Initial Verus Run\n1: Change to your Home folder with: cd ~\n2: Download the bootstrap with:\nwget https://bootstrap.0x03.services/veruscoin/VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz\n3: Next, create the VerusCoin folder with:\nmkdir -p .komodo/VRSC\n4: Unpack the tar into the VerusCoin folder with:\ntar -xvf VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz -C .komodo/VRSC/\nNow you are ready to launch Verus Coin and wait for the initial sync to complete.\nTo simplify this, use \u201cscreen\u201d, so you can log back in over SSH and see the status. Your system should come with screen installed, if not simply install it with sudo apt install screen\nNow, from your Home folder launch screen with: screen\nThis will start a new terminal inside your SSH session to which you can reattach later.\nNow launch Verus daemon for the first time with:\n./verus-cli/verusd -mint\nYou can safely close your SSH terminal window. When you return to check it later, reattach to the screen with: screen -r\nYou may want to skip setting up scripts and email alerts. If you do, be sure to follow the tasks in \u201cScripts to Create and Tasks to Take AFTER Verus Syncs\u201d.\nStep 4: Setup Scripts and Email Alerts\nThis is, of course, optional but it makes your life easier! The first thing I would do with this is create a text document where you can keep notes on different commands you\u2019ll need to issue down the road, commands you may not want to script.\nFor example, to unshield coins (send from your zsAddr, the new Sapling Z address, to your tAddr) you may want to issue the command each time so you can be custom with your amount as well as wallet addresses. Shielding, however, can be done with a single command for All coinbases that need shielding, so it\u2019s easy to script.\nYou can also store your t and zs addresses in that document, so you can easily copy and paste whenever necessary. I have a spreadsheet with calculations and all sorts of interesting data I like to track, so you may go that route\u2026or just a simple text file will do.\nFor scripts that involve emailing you, you\u2019ll need to construct your \u201cFrom\u201d email address with a specific format which involves your IP. Here\u2019s how it works: youruser@Your.IP.address.reversed.in-addr.arpa\nFor example, let\u2019s say your Droplet server IP is 55.44.33.22. The correct \u201cFrom\u201d email would be: youruser@22.33.44.55.in-addr.arpa\nYou\u2019ll see this in the script, just change the IP numbers to your IP reversed and the username to yours.\nSome of the scripts below are only able to be created after Verus has fully sync\u2019d up, since you need to generate wallet addresses, etc. I\u2019ll notate which one\u2019s those are.\nThese scripts assume you have VerusCoin in your Home folder and that you are running the scripts from your Home folder. Also, please note with each new script you\u2019ll want to make it executable with chmod +x scriptname.sh replacing the name of course, to the name of your script. You can then run the script with ./scriptname.sh\nScripts You Can Create Before Verus Syncs\nScript 1 \u2014 Check that Verus is Running\nCreate a script called checkverus.sh using nano, and put the following in, changing the reverse IP, username and protonmail email to yours:\n#!/bin/bash\nif pgrep -x \"komodod\" > /dev/null\nthen\n TRUE=\"1\"\nelse\n echo \"Your Miner Has Stopped Staking!!! HELP!!\" | mail -s \"OUTAGE: MinerHostName\" -a \"From: youruser@22.33.44.55.in-addr.arpa\" you@protonmail.com\nfi\nScript 2 \u2014 Check for New Blocks Mined\nCreate a file called txHistory.txt using nano and enter a value of -2, then save and exit. Now create a script called stakingstatus.sh using nano and put in the following, being careful to change the /home/youruser portions to your own username along with the email from, reverse IP and protonmail\u2026and your server hostname for the Subject line of course:\n#!/bin/bash\nhistoricalcount=$(cat /home/youruser/txHistory.txt)\nlivecount=$(/home/youruser/verus-cli/verus getwalletinfo | grep txcount | sed 's/[0-9]*//g')\nif (($livecount > $historicalcount))\nthen\n echo $livecount > /home/youruser/txHistory.txt\n echo \"Your Miner Has Staked More Coinage! Woot!\" | mail -s \"YourHostName Just Staked Another Block\" -a \"From: youruser@22.33.44.55.in-addr.arpa\" you@protonmail.com\n /home/youruser/backup.sh\nelse\n NOCHANGE=\"1\"\nfi\nThis will, on first run, compare to -2 and replace it with 0 and backup the wallet\u2026but we\u2019ll do that later. Also, as a note, anytime there is a new transaction in your wallet this script will initiate, since it looks at tx count of the walletinfo. I\u2019m working on a better way to do this, so you may be alerts that a block is mined when it was you doing a shield or unshield for example.\nScript 3 \u2014 Wallet Backups\nThis script is optional, as mentioned before. For this script, create a file called backup.sh using nano and enter the code below. Be sure to change the file path /home/youruser to your username and of course the reverse IP, username, hostname, and protonmail to yours:\necho \"Attached Backup\" | mail -s \"YourHostName Backup\" -A /home/youruser/.komodo/VRSC/wallet.dat -a \"From: youruser@22.33.44.55.in-addr.arpa\" you@protonmail.com\nScripts to Create and Tasks to Take AFTER Verus Syncs\nAll tasks should be done from within your Home folder and this is where to store all your scripts as well.\nTask 1 \u2014 Setup Crontab for Above Scripts\nThe above scripts can run automatically and alert you, run backups, etc while your sever is mining. You can set your own cronjob schedule, but I\u2019ve put a suggested entry below.\nTo edit cron, issue the command: crontab -e\nThen at the bottom of the file put the following, changing the username to yours:\n*/5 * * * * /home/youruser/stakingstatus.sh\n0 * * * * /home/youruser/checkverus.sh\n0 12 * * * /home/youruser/backup.sh\nTask 2\u2014 Find Your New Transparent Address\n./verus-cli/verus getaddressesbyaccount \"\"\nThis will output your Transparent Wallet address. If you are importing a wallet, disregard.\nTask 3\u2014 Generate a New zs Sapling Address\n./verus-cli/verus z_getnewaddress sapling\nThis will output a new zs Address (Sapling type shielded address which begins with \u201czs\u201d) for use with Shielding and Unshielding your coinbases you mine, and for collecting any Cheats caught by the Cheat Catcher.\nTask 4 \u2014 How to Enable Cheat Catcher on Verus Launch w/ Staking\nYou must include the parameter -cheatcatcher=zsaddr (where zsaddr is your zs address you generated) when launching the daemon. So for example, to launch the Verus daemon to Stake and Cheat Catch, you would launch it as:\n ./verus-cli/verusd -mint -cheatcatcher=zsaddr\nScript 1 \u2014 Shield Staked Coins\nCreate a new script using nano (maybe call it shield.sh) and enter the following, changing the zsAddr to your new zsAddress you generated in Task 3 above:\n./verus-cli/verus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\" zsAddr\nScript 2 \u2014 View Your zs Addr Balance\nYou\u2019ll see the zsAddr balance change once the shielding has finished. Create a new script using nano and enter the following, changing zsAddr to your new zsAddress:\n./verus-cli/verus z_getbalance zsAddr\nUnshield Coins Command Line\nTo unshield you\u2019ll want to issue the command so you can control the amount of coins. There is a way to create variables in a script but I also like verifying addresses are correct, etc.\nTo unshield coins, you\u2019ll issue the following command, putting your zsAddr and tAddr and the correct number of coins for the amount:\n./verus-cli/verus z_sendmany \"zsAddr\" \"[{\\\"address\\\": \\\"transparentAddr\\\", \\\"amount\\\":500}]\"\nStep 5: Begin Staking!\nAgain, you will start the daemon with:\n ./verus-cli/verusd -mint -cheatcatcher=zsaddr where \u201czsaddr\u201d is your \u201czs\u201d Sapling address you generated above in Task 3.\nYou are now staking and your node is looking for cheats to catch!\nNOTE: Do not use the same wallet on more than one server to stake the same coins. That is considered cheating and any rewards staked while cheating can be taken by other Cheat Catchers on the network. Learn more here.\nIf you are starting a new wallet on this Droplet, you\u2019ll simply want to send VRSC to your new Transparent Wallet address in sends of 500 or fewer coins. This is ideal for staking as it will create a new UTXO for each send to the wallet. After 150 confirmations the coins will be staking!\nWith the scripts setup properly you\u2019ll receive an email every time a new block is mined. You can then login and shield it, unshield it, etc. If you setup the backup script, it will also email your wallet.dat file to your secure protonmail account every time a new block is mined.\nIf you want to use an existing wallet for staking, you would do all the above steps up until waiting for the system to sync. Then after it syncs, you\u2019d stop verus with ./verus-cli/verus stop and replace the wallet.dat file located in the .komodo/VRSC folder with your wallet.dat file. Then start the daemon again and you\u2019ll see your balance.\nFinal Notes\nAs I mentioned above, having UTXOs of 500 or less is ideal\u2026and really closer to 500 is better for staking. You can see all your UTXOs at any time by issuing the command: ./verus-cli/verus listunspent\nOn that note, because a block reward is 48 coins presently and soon to be halved, it can benefit you to shield several blocks before unshielding a larger sum. For example, you can shield each block as it arrives, then check your zAddr balance and say when it\u2019s near 400 coins you can unshield all in a single transaction\u2026which in turn creates a UTXO of that size which is more ideal for staking than, say, 47.999 coins.\nI hope this guide is found to be helpful and easy to follow and if you have any questions please feel free to connect with me in the Verus Discord server! If there\u2019s any issue with the above info I\u2019ll make updates as necessary.

We use the innovative Verus blockchain technology with its versatile currency launches, which can be used both for centralized and decentralized projects. And we don\u2019t even need to code anything!\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Note that this walkthrough is for the Verus Testnet blockchain, which already has the functionalities that the PBaaS-upgrade (Public Blockchains as a Service) will bring to mainnet. Also, the commands are for macOS and Linux, as Windows works a bit differently. We use the CLI wallet for Verus. Download here \ud83d\udd17 You can also use Verus Desktop with its incorporated terminal.\nFictional Company \u201cVery Good Gold\u201d\nIn this technological showcase, we have a fictional company that is an issuer of a centralized token with 1:1 backing of gold. With a starting supply of 0. The issuer of this token has full control of minting and burning capabilities.\nThe mint and burn process however needs to be approved by two signers, making sure one entity doesn\u2019t have full control. For this example we use a 2 of 2 signature setup. Any signature setup is possible (with a maximum of 13 of 25), depending on different use cases.\nDefining a Currency\nDefining a currency on the Verus network is simple, just two commands. When the currency is successfully launched it can flow around within the protocol, and outside of the protocol (learn how to export a currency as an ERC-20 to Ethereum \ud83d\udd17). Let\u2019s get started.\nVerusID Namespace\n\nBefore defining the currency, we already registered the VerusID VGG@. This cost us 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 when using a referral), which were distributed to the block producers. These costs can drastically vary depending on which PBaaS-blockchain we create a VerusID.\nVerusID is the namespace for currencies and PBaaS-blockchains, among many other things. Learn more about VerusID \ud83d\udd17\nWe also said to have a 2 of 2 signature setup. This means the identity is controlled by two primary addresses, with always two signatures needed to do any action (like launching the currency, minting, burning and sending).\nDefining the currency\nDefining a currency costs 200 VRSCTEST. These costs can change depending on which blockchain you want to define a currency on. When launching PBaaS-chains you can define your own costs in the chains\u2019 native currency. Good to know: these costs are going to the miners and stakers of the blockchain.\nWith a few simple commands, we will:\nDefine the currency\nHave it signed by a second signature\nLaunch the currency\nBefore starting we must fund VGG@ with 200+ VRSCTEST to launch the currency. The chain definition is as follows:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n  \"name\":\"VGG\", \n  \"options\":32, \n  \"proofprotocol\":2\n}'\nIt\u2019s a simple chain definition, with only \u201coptions\u201d:32 (= the currency is just a token), and \u201cproofprotocol\u201d:2 (= the controller of the VerusID where the currency is launched from can mint and burn tokens at will).\nThese are some options and specifications that are possible when launching a currency: as a simple token, as fractional reserve currency or multi-reserve basket, start & end block, min. & max. preconversions, initial contributions, pre-launch discount & carveout, initial supply and much more.\n\u2b50 To learn more about the many different launch options when defining a currency on Verus, go here \ud83d\udd17 We encourage anyone to start testing the protocol to get ahead of the game. The community is happy to help on Discord \ud83d\udd17\nApproving and launching the currency\nNow, the second signer needs to come in and sign off on the currency definition, and launch the currency.\nThe command from before gives out a HEX. The second signer needs to sign this HEX as follows:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST signrawtransaction \"hex\"\nThis gives out another HEX. We use it to submit the transaction to the chain, which in turn launches the currency.\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction \"hex\"\nAfter doing the command above, it takes around 15 blocks before the currency is officially launched on the network.\nNext step is the minting and burning of tokens, according to how much gold the company has in custody.\nMinting and burning\nSay a customer put 10,000 ounces of gold into the custody of the company. Now let\u2019s make sure the customer gets that amount of VGG into their wallet.\nWe mint 10,000 VGG with this simple command:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"VGG@\" '[{\n  \"address\":\"Customer1@\", \n  \"currency\":\"VGG\", \n  \"mintnew\":1, \n  \"amount\":10000\n}]'\nVGG@ is the change-address, Customer1@ is the address where the 10,000 VGG are minted to.\nThe second signer needs to do signrawtransaction and sendrawtransaction, as we have done before, to actually mint the tokens into Customer1@.\nNow, if someone wants to redeem their VGG for gold again, we need to be able to burn that amount from the supply of VGG. We burn with the following command:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"VGG@\" '[{\n  \"address\":\"VGG@\", \n  \"currency\": \"VGG\", \n  \"amount\": 5000, \n  \"burn\":true\n}]' \nTo make it happen, the second signer needs to sign off on it again.\nIf we want to check to see the supply of the currency, we can do the following command:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency \u201cvgg\u201d\nUse VGG in Many Ways\nThis article showcased a simple example of how a business can function using the Verus protocol. What we can do with the network goes far beyond what is possible using current blockchain protocols. And all of that without any programming needed!\nWe can also easily export the VGG token to Ethereum as an ERC-20. It can also become one of the reserves in a multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM (automated market maker) as part of Verus DeFi.\nAnybody can define a multi-reserve currency which includes VGG as a reserve with weighted percentage (10\u201390%). The reserves grow as they retain a small fee whenever assets are traded in/out/through.\nA multi-reserve currency itself can also be used as one of the reserves in another multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM token on Verus.\n\ud83d\udc40 Stay tuned for more examples, or start reading docs.verus.io, or join the Discord to learn.\n\ud83e\udee1 Credits for the article go to community member \u2018ejuliano\u2019.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Explore with the community on Discord\nFollow on Twitter\nGo to verus.io\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: February 2022\u200a\u2014\u200aVerus Monthly Recap\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/february-2022-verus-monthly-recap-d3385e09cd32\nContent:\n\nFebruary 2022 \u2014 Verus Monthly Recap\nThe latest Verus updates on development, community, ecosystem and more.

Immediately, you are met with big, centralized, advertised corporate solutions sitting atop their money stacks on the front page of results. You keep scrolling. Smaller, cryptocurrency projects slowly fill your screen. One seems to stick out to you; it\u2019s fancy website and pointy, triangular logo draw you to it\u2019s instruction page. You read it, watch some videos, and get started, only to find that you\u2019ll need to fork a Github repository, create an Amazon AWS account or Droplet account, subscribe to some centralized service, and set up an array of servers.\nThis may stop some people from moving on, but not you, you\u2019re driven. You trudge through hours of your time, some of your money, and finally, it\u2019s ready.\nYou\u2019ve done it. Created a blockchain. Congratulations! You\u2019ve finished the easiest part. What lies ahead includes months of growing a community, struggling with exchanges, building a wallet, creating infrastructure, finding help, publishing your idea, and becoming known. Hopefully, at the end of all this, you\u2019ll have enough time, money, and motivation to actually start implementing your idea, but it\u2019s easy to understand why we might not be seeing all of the potential we hear so much about.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Creators shouldn\u2019t have to jump through numerous centralized hurdles, deal with multiple different companies, and ultimately rely on others to bring their ideas to life. This is why Verus was created. Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) enables a decentralized, automated experience to not only the use of blockchains, but their creation as well.\nUsing an intuitive GUI wallet, anyone with a little bit of VerusCoin (or Verus Test Coin for now), has the ability to define and start up their own public blockchain in minutes. Any miner will be able to see your new chain as soon as it\u2019s created, and merge-mine your chain with Verus, along with 13 other chains as well, meaning, they\u2019re hashpower on Verus will apply to your chain too. Through this process, your chain is also automatically cross-validated through Verus, bolstering it\u2019s security, and making it immune to multiple different forms of attack.\nThis technology allows for the creation of a near infinitely scalable, completely decentralized, secure ecosystem of blockchain applications, that you can easily be a part of.\nBut don\u2019t trust me, verify my claims yourself on the VerusCoin test-net by following a simple guide.\nHow to create your own chain on the Verus Testnet\n1 \u2013 Download the GUI Wallet Tech Release\nTo get started, simply head to this GitHub page, and download the latest desktop wallet for your operating system.\n2 \u2013 Start the Verus Test chain\nClick Add Coin, select VRSCTEST, and select \u201cActivate Coin\u201d. This will either spin up VRSCTEST, or, you\u2019ll be prompted to download any required ZCash parameters. If prompted, choose a server, and download the parameters. After the download is done, redo this step.\nIf you\u2019re having trouble getting it to start, don\u2019t worry! Check out this FAQ page, or ask the community for help in one of the Verus Discord channels here.\n\n3 \u2013 Obtain some VRSCTEST coins\nGetting some of your own VRSCTEST is easy, simply mine some by yourself, or hop into the Verus discord and show us your receiving address. Any freindly test-net whales would be happy to give you some for free.\nOnce the syncing progress bar in your wallet loads fully, you\u2019ll be able to see your coins in your balance.\n\n3 \u2013 Open the PBaaS create menu\nOnce you\u2019ve got a balance, you\u2019re ready to explore PBaaS! Navigate to the PBaaS tab, and you\u2019ll notice the options to Connect, Discover and create. Connect and Discover allow you to connect to and explore all the chains already created on the testnet. If you\u2019d like to create your own, head to the create tab.\n\n4 \u2013 Fill out the create form (Steps 1 \u2013 4)\nFill out the create a chain form to specify exactly what you want, and how you want it. After giving your creation a name, you have a huge number of options that make your chain unique. Do you want a premine? If so, how large? How should your reward schedule be outlined? How much will you reward notaries for securing your chain?\nThe initial amount you pay to start the chain in VRSCTEST will be what you put as the \u201cinitial notarization offer\u201d in step 4 of the form. You\u2019ll need to make sure your balance can cover that.\n\n5 \u2013 Finish the create form (Steps 5 \u2013 6)\nAfter you\u2019ve finished specifying your chain to your needs, you\u2019ll need to provide it with two public nodes (that are going to run your chain) to start on. Setup your own first public nodes, or, ask the helpful community on the Verus discord to help you bootstrap your chain and give you some addresses to use. This step will be automated soon, but for now, you\u2019ll need to provide initial nodes manually.\nAfter you\u2019ve sorted that out, review your chain data, and press \u201cconfirm\u201d when you\u2019re ready!\nIf a little green window pops up in the corner of your screen, congratulations! You\u2019ve started a chain! Otherwise, you\u2019ll get a little error message telling you what\u2019s wrong.\n\nOnce the transaction that created your chain gets one confirmation (you can see this on your transactions screen), everyone connected to the test-net will be able to see your chain on the discover page, or search for it on the connect page, and connect to it!\nYou\u2019ve just launched a secure, zk-SNARK and smart transaction supporting, 51% hash attack resistant, publicly mineable and stakeable blockchain in 5 simple steps, on a decentralized platform, without requiring or relying on any centralized entity. What\u2019s even better is that you can mine and stake your own project and use the same hash power to mine and stake up to 14 other coins, earning cryptocurrency while helping other teams and realizing your own unique vision!\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: VerusCoin 0.5.3 Official Release Notes\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/veruscoin-0-5-0-official-release-notes-6d371095dc7a\nContent:\n\nVerusCoin 0.5.3 Official Release Notes\nVerusHash 2.0 Mandatory Upgrade \u2014 Fire Up Those CPUs! Plus Side-by-Side Verus and Komodo Daemon Support in Verus Agama, and Two Bounty Offerings\n\nAn important foundational principle upon which Verus Coin is established is that of decentralization. In the proof of work this was highlighted from launch, when Verus developed the fastest CPU hash algorithm in the world, effectively VerusHash 1.0, in a 100% fair launch. Today we are announcing VerusHash 2.0, in a continued commitment to decentralization and the design and ongoing maintenance of a cutting edge PoW hashing algorithm.\nTLDR: NEW in this Release\nTime to dust off that CPU (and your kids gaming computer and your best friends modern laptop, and well, EVERY CPU you can get your hands on!) and prepare for an EPIC mining experience to usher in 2019!\nNew VerusHash 2.0 includes novel techniques designed to close the performance gap between CPU, GPU, and FPGA\nNew Agama Daemon Support of Verus and Komodo/Komodo Asset Chains running in native side-by-side and Verus enhanced features on other asset chains\nGet Verus v0.5.3 with VerusHash 2.0\nVerus v0.5.3 can be built from source or downloaded for your OS using the following links. Please remember to backup your wallet.dat file prior to any update.\nThis is a mandatory update before December 28th. All clients must be updated before block 310000, we recommend updating before Dec 27.\nTo download the binary or GUI (Agama) for your OS:\nhttps://veruscoin.io/#download\nor\nhttps://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.5.3\nTo build from source:\nhttps://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin\nGUI Users: Follow our guide to updating your wallet\nIMPORTANT\nTHIS IS A MANDATORY UPDATE, AND IF YOU DO NOT UPDATE, YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE MAIN VERUS CHAIN AFTER BLOCK 310000, WHICH WILL BE MINED ON DECEMBER 28, 2018.\nVerusHash 2.0\nVerusHash 2.0 is explicitly designed to address the gap in hash power that FPGAs have over CPUs today on the Verus network. While initial activation will likely mean no FPGAs (and possibly even no GPUs) on the Verus network at least temporarily, our goal is more equivalence across returns on various types of hardware while continuing to enable people with just a CPU to easily contribute to and join the Verus Community through mining.\nVerusHash 2.0 is designed to better equalize mining across all hardware platforms, while favoring the latest CPUs over older types, which is also one defense against the centralizing potential of botnets.\nStrategy Involved in VerusHash Design\nBecause VerusHash 1.0 was designed with the Haraka V2 Core, it leveraged highly integrated instruction sets of modern CPUs and in turn GPUs didn\u2019t gain too much of an advantage when they were implemented. In the original hash, the strategy was to advantage CPUs through the use of these optimizations, and we knew we would consider adjusting the hash if hardware was made for this algorithm, however we did not have a reference point of comparison until now.\nThe goal of closing the gap between CPUs and GPUs with 1.0 was to promote decentralization, allowing more people from around the world to participate in mining Verus Coin and creating a stronger network together. Rather than simply advantaging a small number of integrated CPU instructions, using Haraka V2 Core, we have deeply considered a number of hardware characteristics across different target hardware to invent VerusHash 2.0.\nBased on efforts to ensure that the algorithm leverages a number of additional strengths of CPUs, while placing more of a burden on some weaknesses of FPGAs, specifically, we are optimistic that VerusHash 2.0 will significantly close, if not eliminate, the gap between ROI on various types of hardware.\nIf for any reason, VerusHash 2.0 goes too far, and FPGAs become economically useless for mining Verus Coin, which we don\u2019t believe is the likely outcome, we can discuss tuning with the community, as the algorithm includes many new parameters that can be used to adjust its relative speed on different hardware.\nBotnet Resistant\nWhile you can never prevent capable, controlled PCs from being used for mining, it is far more likely that the CPUs in those PCs will be older, rather than the newest models. With VerusHash 2.0, modern CPUs are strongly advantaged over older CPUs, and the newest, advantaged even more.\nDrop in Nethash\nBecause VerusHash 2.0 is doing so much more than its predecessor, one result of this algorithm will be a significant drop in the nethash. It is important to understand that this does not indicate any drop in level of security of the blockchain.\nWhile we hope all of you will fire up your favorite newer CPU to join us in welcoming the new algorithm, the algorithm will not go as fast as the older algorithm on any device, and we should see hashrate numbers closer to the early days of mining Verus. Again, this does NOT reflect any issue with regards to our immunity to 51% hash attacks, as the Verus Proof of Power algorithm is not subject to that vulnerability.\nVerus Agama Improvements\nIn this release of the Verus Enhanced Agama wallet (GUI) we are introducing full support of any Komodo asset running natively alongside Verus Coin. This is done by separating out the daemon for Komodo, allowing both the Verus daemon and the Komodo daemon to run simultaneously.\nThis change will allow us to add native support from other coin daemons in the future as well, while maintaining maximum compatibility with each coin supported. We believe we added all active coins in the Komodo ecosystem, but if we missed out on your favorite, please reach out on Discord and let us know!\nTwo Related Bounty Offerings!\nIn conjunction with this release, the Verus foundation is offering two bounties, one for GPU and one for FPGA development. The bounty of each is for the first implementation of a competitive miner for VerusHash 2.0 for that particular hardware type with some stipulations:\nThe code must be made open source and available to the community without first being used in secret.\nTo qualify, the miner implementation must beat the best CPU hash rate by at least 1.5x hash rate for a comparably priced CPU-to-device.\nFor GPUs the target GPU individually performing the qualifying hash rate must be common (and available to the general public) nVidia or AMD devices. For FPGAs, the hardware performing the qualifying hash rate must be easily available and under $1250 per device.\nSubmitted and qualifying implementations must be completed, working, and in a form that can be easily tested by a representative of the Verus Coin Foundation. This bounty offer will automatically end 90 days after this release (prior to March 20, 2019) and may be renewed by the Verus Coin Foundation at its sole discretion. Entries submitted will also be determined eligible for a bounty at the sole discretion of the Verus Coin Foundation and its representatives.\nFor a qualifying GPU software miner, over and above any additional bounties earned by any qualifying developer, the bounty will be 50,000 VRSC. For a qualifying FPGA development, over and above any additional bounties earned by any qualifying developer, the bounty will be 100,000 VRSC. Both of these bounties will be provided as addresses holding time-locked VRSC, which will release uniformly over the next 1 year and ~8.5 months.\nGood luck developers!\nGet involved in Verus Coin and the Verus community\nWant to learn more about Verus Coin?

The Verus Protocol was selected as 1 of 7 finalists invited to present at the event after Fidelity and Dogpatch conducted a deep analysis of over 200 disruptors from every corner of Europe under the themes \u2018Future Money & Assets\u2019, \u2018Web3\u2019, \u2018Post-Pandemic Impacts\u2019 and \u2018Zero Interfaces\u2019.\nMichael Toutonghi receives the Inspiration Award\nMichael Toutonghi, the lead developer of the Verus Protocol, presented an overview of the Verus Protocol and how it creates an opportunity for people to collaborate worldwide in ways that haven\u2019t been possible before. He outlined the founding purpose of The Verus Protocol and how it\u2019s designed to enable a truly decentralized, people-powered protocol that can be used by any person, community, organization, or government to power their economy as part of a much larger worldwide network of economies.\nMichael Toutonghi presents the Verus Protocol\nThe growing Verus community was excited to have Fidelity and Dogpatch recognize the innovation of these efforts, which have been fully functional on the Verus testnet and are being prepared by contributors across the community for our imminent mainnet upgrade.\nThe Verus Protocol, currently testing and preparing its Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) upgrade for mainnet release, emerged as the only community-driven, public infrastructure protocol to appear in the final seven finalists for the Future Horizons event. The Verus PBaaS upgrade will extend the Verus mainnet protocol, which currently features the first and only core primitive of a revocable, recoverable and provable yet private identity and peer to peer marketplace technology adding a decentralized, multi-chain, multi-currency protocol for launching currencies, independent and connected blockchains, and performing fully decentralized, on chain exchanges of currencies, IDs, legal contracts, and more.\nMichael Toutonghi presents the Verus Protocol\nHistory of The Verus Protocol\nThe Verus Protocol went live on its mainnet, which is a public, decentralized blockchain, in 2018 with a vision of Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) powering scalable, autochains and applications through staking and mining, as outlined in the Verus Vision paper. The Protocol launched with no ICO, no preallocation of funds, and no development fee, or middlemen built into the protocol. The worldwide community built the Verus Protocol to offer both transparent and zero knowledge privacy, and as an improvement to the Bitcoin consensus algorithm, a more ecologically efficient consensus protocol. Verus was the first and is still the only blockchain protocol with self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable, and interoperable addresses and privacy enhanced identities built into the core.\nAny individual, project, organization or community needing an easy to use, reliable, decentralized, rent-free currency or fundraising platform, voting network, automated accounting system, self-sovereign, revocable/recoverable identity, or governance model can connect to the Verus Internet of Value and get started without programming. Solutions that used to take weeks or longer to design and code with programmers can now be done by domain experts, better, faster and more securely than before.\nWith the Verus\u2019s Protocol, challenges of today can be naturally solved by scaling-out as needed, whether requirements call for centralized corporate, open government, or fully decentralized applications. In addition to this new solution, disruptive even among modern blockchains, the open, community-driven model enables Verus to be the first and only credibly neutral, rent-free, decentralized financial network.\n\nConsensus 2022\nThe Verus Protocol will be on display in booth 242 at the upcoming Consensus 2022 that takes place in Austin, Texas June 9 \u2014 June 12.

Unlike many staking systems your Verus is completely accessible while it\u2019s staking, it isn\u2019t locked up, inaccessible, or out of your control in any way. You just have to flip a switch in your wallet to turn it on, and your Verus remains in your wallet the whole time, and can be spent at any time.\nVerus uses a novel consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Power (PoP) which is a hybrid half Proof-of-Work (PoW), half Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system. Half of the blocks are mined using VerusHash, and the other half are \u201cminted\u201d via staking. This means that both miners and stakers are doing the work to process transactions and secure the network, and that attackers would need BOTH a significant share of mining hash rate AND of the available supply of Verus (VRSC) to attack the network.\nEvery block has a chance of being won by staking, and over time it averages out that half of the blocks are solved by mining and half by staking. The average block time on Verus is 1 minute. If you stake a block you\u2019ll get the block reward and any transaction fees paid by users to have their transactions processed. At the time of writing, the block reward is 12 VRSC, and there is a halving (the reward drops in half) approximately every two years, the last of which was in November 2020.\nThe chances of staking and receiving a block reward for any given block are proportional to the amount of Verus you\u2019re staking. There is no minimum amount of Verus required to stake, and any funds kept in a transparent address or a VerusID that have been there for at least 150 blocks (about 150 minutes) may be used to stake.\nYour wallet must be running, connected to the internet, and synced with the Verus blockchain with staking enabled in order to stake. Addresses/wallets should only be staked from a single computer. By default staking is disabled to prevent unintentionally staking from multiple computers or creating problems with accounting for staked funds when they\u2019re not expected.\nStaking Requirements\nTo stake successfully your wallet must meet these requirements:\nFunds held in one or more transparent addresses or VerusIDs in the wallet\nWallet is running, online, synced to the Verus blockchain on a system with an accurate system clock\nStaking is enabled in the wallet software\nVerus Desktop (GUI) Staking How-To\nTo enable staking in the Verus Desktop wallet you\u2019ll open the wallet and go to the Mining tab. Here on the mining dashboard you can enable staking by clicking the icon of the dollar sign with the slash through it.\n\nOr, from the mining dashboard you can click on Verus on the left side, then toggle staking on in the main interface.\n\nThat should get you staking. With staking enabled you\u2019ll get a dashboard showing estimates for potential staking returns given the current network conditions that looks like this:\n\nThe calculator is always only an estimate, since the whole system is based on statistical averages over time, and dependent on changing network conditions. In particular, these estimates and your results will vary based on how much Verus is being staked on the rest of the network by all participants in any given moment.\nNotice in that calculator that it shows only a portion staking \u2014 this is because a portion of the balance is unavailable for staking, having recently staked, and will be available again in 150 blocks. For more information on this aspect see the UTXO Details section below.\nYou\u2019ll know you\u2019ve successfully staked when you see staking transactions and rewards in your transaction list, and when your balance goes up accordingly.\nVerus Command Line (CLI) Staking How-To\nYou might prefer to use Verus on the command line, either to run on much lighter-weight hardware or headless systems, for the ability to script and integrate with Verus, or just for more granular control over your wallet.\nThis assumes you are already familiar with the command line and have verusd running and have met the other prerequisites for being eligible to stake.\nYou can enable staking in a running wallet using this command:\nverus setgenerate true 0\nThis will turn your mining threads down to zero if you were mining. If you want to also re-enable solo mining you can follow this with:\nverus setgenerate true X\nwhere X is the number of threads you want to mine with.\nYou can disable staking AND mining using:\nverus setgenerate false\nYou can get your current staking/mining status using:\nverus getmininginfo\nwhich will return something like this:\n{ \n \u201cblocks\u201d: 1424603,\n \u201ccurrentblocksize\u201d: 0,\n \u201ccurrentblocktx\u201d: 0,\n \u201caverageblockfees\u201d: 1.20011909,\n \u201cdifficulty\u201d: 1004965568496.515,\n \u201cstakingsupply\u201d: 41243165.47632869,\n \u201cerrors\u201d: \u201c\u201d,\n \u201cgenproclimit\u201d: 0,\n \u201clocalhashps\u201d: 0,\n \u201cnetworkhashps\u201d: 351834027116,\n \u201cpooledtx\u201d: 1,\n \u201ctestnet\u201d: false,\n \u201cchain\u201d: \u201cmain\u201d,\n \u201cgenerate\u201d: true,\n \u201cstaking\u201d: true,\n \u201cnumthreads\u201d: 0,\n \u201cmergemining\u201d: 0\n}\nThe \u201cstakingsupply\u201d figure is an estimate of how much Verus has been staking on the whole network recently. Your approximate chances of staking any given block can be calculated by dividing your eligible staking balance (funds at least 150 blocks old in transparent addresses or IDs) by the staking supply.\nTo enable staking after verusd is restarted you can add the following to your VRSC.conf file:\nmint=1\nor pass -mint to verusd when launching it.\nEnabling StakeGuard\nStakeGuard is a system for solving the Nothing-at-Stake problem. By configuring StakeGuard you have a chance of receiving the ill-gotten staking rewards from those who are trying to cheat the network (or potentially from those who make the mistake of staking their wallet from different computers at the same time, since the network can\u2019t tell these two cases apart).\nTo enable StakeGuard on the Verus Desktop GUI go to the main wallet screen for Verus and click the green Receive button under Private Balance. Then click the copy icon for an address you\u2019d like your StakeGuard proceeds to go to. If you don\u2019t yet have a private address, click the \u201cnew private address\u201d button.\n\nWith your private address copied, click on the gear icon in the upper right corner to enter settings, then click on Coin Settings on the left. Make sure Verus(VRSC) is selected in the dropdown right below the settings icon. Then paste your private address into the StakeGuard address field and save your changes.\n\nThat\u2019s it for the GUI.\nTo enable StakeGuard in the CLI wallet you\u2019ll edit your VRSC.conf file and add a z-address in a line formatted like this:\ncheatcatcher=ZADDR\nor pass it as a parameter to verusd when launching using the parameter like so:\n-cheatcatcher=\u201dZADDR\u201d\nUTXO Details\nA few notes on some of the finer points of staking \u2014 you can ignore this part and do just fine with staking, but this might be useful to you if you\u2019re looking for the slightly deeper dive.\nThe balance in your wallet is made up of the sum of the transactions that have been sent to an address or VerusID in your wallet that haven\u2019t been spent. When you\u2019re staking it is actually each individual unspent transaction output (UTXO) that\u2019s eligible to stake.\nWhen a UTXO stakes it is actually spent, being sent back to the same address again. This means it still shows up in your balance, but it becomes ineligible to stake again for 150 blocks. For the next 150 blocks after a stake you\u2019ll notice that the value of the UTXO that staked will be missing from your eligible staking balance, but also notice that your other UTXOs remain eligible to stake during this period.\nFor this reason, if you\u2019re staking a large balance you\u2019ll likely have better staking performance by making sure your balance is split up between multiple UTXOs \u2014 by having sent it to the wallet in multiple transactions rather than a single large transaction or otherwise redistributing it within the wallet. This keeps a larger portion of your funds available for staking while the successful stakes have to wait 150 blocks to be available for staking again. There are quickly diminishing returns here though, and having too many small transactions can decrease your wallet\u2019s efficiency in scanning all of them for eligible stakes. My recommendation is to not bother breaking up any UTXOs smaller than 5,000 VRSC.\nThe odds of each individual UTXO staking are independent, and proportional to their value. This means that one 10,000VRSC UTXO has the same odds of staking as a group of ten 1,000VRSC UTXOs.\nVerus Vault\nVerus Vault will soon move from Testnet to the main Verus network. Verus Vault allows a VerusID to be locked and prevented from spending until it is unlocked and a specified cooldown time has passed or a specific block height is reached, or until the ID is revoked and recovered. Verus Vault allows the funds in a locked ID to stake, so users protecting their funds this way won\u2019t miss out on staking opportunities.\nCurrencies and PBaaS\nAlso on the Verus Testnet right now is functionality for creating and trading using currencies. I recommend starting with this article on Verus DeFi to understand more. It is mentioned here to make it clear that currencies on Verus will not be able to stake; only Verus can stake. Also, Verus that resides in the reserves (the liquidity pool) of a fractional currency is unable to stake.\nPBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) chains have their own coin, which is mineable and/or stakeable on that chain, but not on the Verus network directly.\nFees and the Fee Pool\nIn addition to the block reward miners and stakers are rewarded with the fees users pay to have their transactions processed by the network.\nAnother Testnet feature that will soon migrate to the main Verus network is the fee pool. The fees that go to the miners and stakers (such as transaction fees, ID registration costs, and others) will go into the fee pool, and each miner or staker will get to take 1% of what is in the fee pool along with their block reward. This makes mining/staking proceeds from fees more stable over time, rather than having occasional blocks with high fees from high-fee events like ID registrations. It also helps align incentives by making sure no potentially malicious miner or staker might want to mine for a previous block if the fees were particularly lucrative, since those fees are averaged out over time.\nTroubleshooting\nIf you believe you\u2019re having problems with staking here are a few things to check:\nCheck your eligible staking balance. Funds in a private address (z-address) aren\u2019t eligible to stake. Also any funds received, transacted with, or staked within the last 150 blocks aren\u2019t eligible. So keep these in mind when assessing your eligible balance. If there\u2019s a discrepancy between your wallet balance and your eligible staking balance not explained by these considerations, there might be something to investigate with the help of the community-support or staking channels on the Verus Discord.\nCheck to ensure that staking is enabled. If you\u2019re using the command line wallet or if you want to look under the hood on the Verus Desktop wallet use the getmininginfo command to see that staking is enabled (\u201cstaking\u201d:true) (on the CLI: verus getmininginfo ; in the GUI wallet: Settings->Coin Settings, then run getmininginfo in the command window).\nCheck your system clock to make sure your time is accurate.\nCheck in with the community on the Verus Discord. If you describe your issue in the community-support or staking channels they\u2019ll be able to help, or can put your mind at ease.\nOne point of confusion worth reviewing \u2014 staking on Verus doesn\u2019t provide a steady trickle of proceeds, instead it is all-or-nothing in each block, earning the full block reward plus fees each time, and the frequency with which you stake a block is based on the amount of Verus you have staking. It\u2019s also all a matter of statistical averages, you may have lucky periods and dry spells, the specifics of when you stake and when you don\u2019t are matters of utter randomness and should even out over long periods of time as a matter of averages. If you have a relatively small amount of Verus your staking rewards may be very infrequent, but there\u2019s always a chance, and over a sufficiently long time there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll stake at some point.\nGood luck and happy staking!\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: Verus Testnet Release Marks New Advancements in Crypto\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-testnet-release-marks-new-advancements-in-crypto-2701bf3e7c3\nContent:\n\nVerus Testnet Release Marks New Advancements in Crypto\n\nWhile much of the dialogue in the blockchain and crypto space dwells on record breaking increases in gas prices and fixes to scale Ethereum, developers are already coding historic technological advancements in the protocol layer that solve many of the issues and challenges the blockchain community is facing.\nThese framework solutions are not leapfrogging current tech for a competitive, monopolizing advantage, but are building for collaboration, blockchain agnosticism and inclusive bridges with interoperable tools, so these systems can work more efficiently, together.\nThere are many projects making huge advancements in the areas of consensus algorithms, privacy, self sovereign identities, fractional reserve currencies and bonding curves, conversion, currency design and launch, but the space has yet to see a protocol that is simultaneously and expediently innovating on all of these layers and weaving the solutions together \u2014 until now.\nDemocratizing the Protocol Layer & Public Blockchains as a Service\nIt launched without an ICO, without a pre-mine, and taking no development fees, and within 15 minutes of its announcement, it was mined and staked by thousands of network members worldwide. That was more than two years ago, and today, open-sourced Verus (Verus Coin.io) is on the leading edge of scalable blockchain technology that, although flying relatively underneath the radar, is having huge ripple effects on the space.\nVerus was launched more than two years ago, an evolution of Komodo, Zcash, BTCD and Bitcoin. A snapshot of its Genesis Block, forked and dated from BTC.\nThe project is supported by contributors around the world and an independent non-profit foundation that offers bounties and aids in the decentralized building of technology by the community. It is in rapid development and has already actualized many parts of its vision for a rent-free blockchain framework that provides chain interoperability and can scale to the world.\nThe Intergenerational Wisdom in the Architecture\nWhile many blockchain developers are still cutting their teeth on this technology, the lead developer of Verus has been around for a while. While Mike Toutonghi often shys from the limelight and shuns hype, it is worth telling that he is a seasoned web veteran who led Kernel development on Microsoft 95, and is also one of the founders of Microsoft\u2019s Java efforts and .Net. Much like his days at Microsoft, where he was adding threads to operating systems where there were none, starting platform efforts that are now used by millions, or architecting data systems for Internet scale advertising, he similarly felt needed to help build the world\u2019s future blockchain infrastructure.\nToutonghi saw that chains needed to talk to each other, that consensus algorithms were not resilient enough, and so began by adding Custom Consensus (smart contracts) to Bitcoin script. The development pioneer went on to modify the core consensus rules and now Toutonghi, alongside his son and dozens of leading developers around the world, are pushing the limits even further, mitigating some of the biggest vulnerabilities and innovating solutions by doing what Toutonghi does best \u2014 inventing solutions, weaving across layers, and building bridges.\nToutonghi and his son, Michael Jr., work with dozens of developers around the world building on Verus\nStealth Mode, Disengage\nVerus is an evolution of Komodo, Zcash, BTCD and Bitcoin, and is currently testing its latest cutting edge technology on the public Verus testnet. The Verus blockchain and all future PBaaS blockchains will support Sapling Zero Knowledge Proofs and Komodo crypto-condition technology as a base layer for its friendly, revocable and recoverable IDs. The community has also developed a multi-coin wallet with support for many coins and ERC20 tokens, VerusIDs, built in mining and privacy, a free cryptographic signing process, staking, and Public Blockchains as a Service. PBaaS allows any community, government, organization or individual, with a few clicks and without much coding knowledge, to launch a fully mineable, secure tokenized blockchain.\nBut where the power lies in Verus, literally, is in its consensus algorithm based on Proof of Power (Verus PoP), a 50\u201350 split of Proof of Stake and Proof of Work and a provable hybrid solution to 51% hash attacks. The PoP also solves the two of the biggest issues undermining other PoS systems \u2014 \u201cnothing at stake\u201d and \u201cweak subjectivity.\u201d You can discover more in the technical white paper or explore its hashing algorithm that lowers the barriers for mining, allowing CPU miners to go almost toe to toe with ASIC miners.\n\nThe Verus consensus algorithm: Proof of Power (Verus PoP), a 50\u201350 split of Proof of Stake and Proof of Work and a provable hybrid solution to 51% hash attacks\nThe list goes on, but these are inherent design features and while talking features may be scintillating for developers, what do these advancements really mean? And what is so groundbreaking about the latest release?\nHistory in the Making: Five Pioneering Developments in One Release\nThis week marks the biggest testnet release for Verus and arguably, one of the biggest in DeFi history and the history of money. The core advancement stems from a multi-currency* UTXO-based \u201cbasket\u201d that forms one fungible currency with all the benefits of each individual currency, but having the simplicity of one. This can be used as a reserve, and can even be the base reserve and liquidity pool (like Uniswap, Bancor or Balancer) for a token launch or as a gas-free, near-instant conversion mechanism. The system is a fractal, market-driven, and completely liquid worldwide network of independently valued currencies.\nIn addition to the currency aspects, the way the reserve pool and the consensus algorithm works, it also holds several other novel solutions allowing flexibility in leveraging blockchain technology to work for society.\n*There is no current limit for the number of currencies in a multi-currency basket; however, the team is considering limiting it to ten for now. Taken to the extreme, one community member has created \u201cSuperMegaGigaCoin\u201d on testnet, with 12 currencies combined in the basket. All baskets must include VRSC.\n5. Liquidity Pools & Conversion in a Blink\nConversion is now as easy as sending currency, without the need for an exchange. Since there is always liquidity inside a multi-reserve currency, soon anyone will be able to convert at any time.\nFor example: a person has ETH and wants to convert to VRSC. That person converts first to the multi-reserve currency ETH*VRSC using their ETH (one transaction), and then they can convert the ETH*VRSC to VRSC (another transaction). In order for this to operate, ETH will need to be represented on the Verus blockchain. This will be handled by Verus\u2019 decentralized bridging capabilities, which are under development.\nThere is no fluctuating gas required, but rather a flat fee of 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to the miners and stakers on the Verus network. Plans are in place to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more. It will allow for the dynamic balancing of volatility, benefiting liquidity providers by offsetting potential losses (impermanent losses) and giving them the opportunity to earn more for providing liquidity, while incentivizing more stability within pools (see #2 below).\n4. An End to Front running\nFront running has plagued traditional markets for years, and blockchain tech, with its public ledgers, has made it even easier for traders looking to game the system, especially on decentralized exchanges. But now, Verus\u2019 new release offers the world\u2019s first solution that does away with front-running, latency wars, and gas price wars.\nThe reserve currency automatically allows for the parallel processing and solving of all DeFi transactions submitted in a block \u2014 a significant advantage over Ethereum\u2019s Virtual Machine and other protocols, which are perfectly designed to perpetuate races and zero-sum games, whereby the most savvy, well-financed players gain all the advantages against the average participant. Everyone can interact with the system knowing that they will get the fair price for their transaction \u2014 the exact same price for all buys and sells submitted by everyone within that block with zero spread.\n3. On-chain Currency Launches\nThe latest testnet release allows anyone to use the command line (under development \u2014 an easy to use dashboard) to freely mint their own token, pegged to any currency or asset.\nFractional Reserve Option\nCurrencies can be defined with any other currencies with (or without) fractional reserve capabilities; those who launch a currency and choose a fractional reserve may also assign a percentage, with the minimum being ten percent.\nIf the creators of a new coin choose to deposit an amount of VRSC in the reserve \u2014 or Verus and a few other currencies to make up that coin\u2019s basket \u2014 that reserve enables anyone holding the new coin to convert this new coin into VRSC or from VRSC into that new coin. With this, coin creators no longer have to rely on exchange listings and paying high fees to access markets and liquidity pools. An incentive for people to participate in this can be a discounted price during the funding period.\nFractional reserve token currencies will need to have the native currency of the chain as part of their reserves, and PBaaS chains that have fractional capabilities will have to contain their parent chain\u2019s native currency. The reserve requirement is similar in that respect to Bancor, supports the network effect and growth in power of the public protocol, and will result in full, programmatic liquidity across the entirety of the worldwide multi-chain system. This allows each independent currency to be liquid and have value based on the currency\u2019s intrinsic properties and the velocity of its use.\nKickstarter-like Launch Minimums & Auto Refunds\nThe funding of this reserve can also be done in a crowd-funding fashion and similar to Kickstarter, a minimum can be assigned and if it is not met, the contributors will automatically receive their funds back. The tools on testnet also allow the coin creator to set dynamic currency launch pricing based on participation, such as pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carve outs, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations.\nMassively Parallel Merge Mining\nWhile the 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge-mineable along with Verus and up to 21 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and securing all chains simultaneously, without needing additional power in the mining software. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens and for native zk-SNARK supporting currencies as well.\nIf the PBaaS chain is a reserve chain, these rewards can be converted into VRSC, increasing the incentive to miners to secure the Verus ecosystem. For staking, the same incentive applies, but is limited only by the amount of chains your system is capable of running in native mode (think full node with entire blockchain).\n\nPrivacy Woven In\nVRSC and by extension, all PBaaS native currencies, whether or not they are fractional, will be able to support zk-SNARKs on native transactions. zk-SNARKs are anticipated to serve as ways to publish and exchange provable, partially or wholly private data and receive messages, paid or otherwise, on the blockchain as well.\n2. Self-Rebalancing Liquidity Pool / Basket\nYet another use for the multi-currency reserve tokens is as a self-rebalancing liquidity pool and basket. When holding baskets on Verus, investments automatically adjust regardless of price movements.\nThis allows for hedging and the ability to profit in the long-term because these holders will receive implied volatility fees for providing liquidity. When using it as a trading mechanism and liquidity pool, traders can capitalize on the arbitrage opportunities created by the price differentials and fluctuations of the rebalancing pools.\nOther automated market makers and systems provide similar rebalancing liquidity pools however, today\u2019s solutions are subject to losses through front running, and without dynamic fees based on volatility, typically charge high fees as a default (compare Uniswap\u2019s 0.3% fee to Verus\u2019 0.025% base fee), often extracting profit from those fees over and above what goes to liquidity providers, miners, and stakers; these baskets provide a fully decentralized way to use these pools that gives all value back to the participants.\n\n1. Mutualization of Value via Proof of Burn\nBy using fractional currencies, combined with the ability to \u201cburn\u201d some of that currency to create a license while returning the value of that burned currency to all holders of the currency, the Verus formal \u201cproof of burn\u201d allows this event to enable new kinds of licensing and use cases. One group is pioneering PPaaC, Patent Portfolios as a Commons, and mutualizing benefits from licensing the use of technologies, which has for years, been monopolized.\nPeople and businesses will be able to buy a specific currency to pay their patent license fees. For every device they license, they will pay the license fee from that currency by burning the prescribed amount and the license will be tied to that specific device. Before the currency goes live, people can \u2018pre-convert\u2019 coins to that currency, to get a discount on the licensing (they get the currency at a cheaper rate than the actual set rate).\nThis way the Verus blockchain provides a method of paying for the licenses (which is not new in itself) and a means of checking if the devices are licensed to use the patented technology (which is also not new in itself). The combination of payments and licensing checks on one platform is completely new though, and allows anyone to buy into the patent market as an investment in the network and concept.\nThe Road Ahead\nOnce testing is complete, the Verus release will be live on mainnet and the development team will continue to iterate on these innovations. The project is always open to more developers as it depends on open source development to support the continued innovation of these technologies.\nDespite the numerous innovations in this testnet release, blockchain technology and token engineering have a long road ahead. Having the new tools and capabilities of Verus will teleport the space light years ahead, but while the current focus thus far has been on a race to build \u201cthe best protocol,\u201d the next step in maturing the tech will be reflected in interoperability and systems modeling and engineering.\nMoving from a single chain mentality to blockchain agnosticism and collaboration will help to ensure the democratization of the Internet and lower barriers of access so everyone can participate in, and benefit from, these new economies.\n\nDownload the wallet now to try fractional reserve currencies on testnet.

This article will focus on what\u2019s already on mainnet, but if you follow crypto and blockchain tech at all, you owe it yourself to dig deeper.\n\nRecently, in response to a post on a Verus Discord channel, someone asked what useful tech Verus already has on mainnet. Here\u2019s a partial answer. There are at least three big, distinct user groups for whom cryptocurrency tech might be useful:\n1. Miners\n2. Early adopters\n3. \u201cGrandparent\u201d users \u2014 late adopters\nWe\u2019re going to talk a little about each group. These are all observations and opinions, and some of the reasons that I think this project is really outstanding \u2014 unique, and truly significant. After this, you should read a little more and come to your own conclusions!\nOne of the compelling things about Verus is how it addresses concerns at each level of the current blockchain stack. At the base level, cryptocurrencies rely on the health of their mining networks, so beginning a project by ensuring that the most miners possible have an incentive to participate and can trust the project\u2019s integrity and security is essential. Among its first innovations, Verus added options for how projects manage their coin emissions schedule by developing coin locking technology that incentivized early adopters while simultaneously locking out the risk of them dumping coins early. This move proved to be characteristic of the project, which has had its long-term development firmly in mind from the very beginning.\nVerus also rolled out VerusHash early, making the project attractive the greatest number of miners by creating a hashing algorithm that worked hard to balance potential contributions from CPU and FPGA miners without putting useful hash power beyond the reach of GPUs. It\u2019s a real testament to the forward looking and long-term commitments to decentralization, integrity, and security that the project began by innovating at this fundamental level. (And of course, in the spirit of the larger cryptocurrency movement, Verus\u2019 innovations, including VerusHash, are open source \u2014 other projects can adopt them.)\nIn addition to VerusHash, Verus added Proof of Power \u2014 a hybrid Proof of Work/Proof of Stake consensus mechanism that provides the best of both worlds by aggregating the protections of each and, importantly, the project published a paper describing how Proof of Power protects against a long term plague on crypto, the Sybil attack. Verus also created its \u2018cheat catcher\u2019 tech to protect against specific mining attacks. VerusHash, Proof of Power, cheat catching \u2014 that\u2019s an excellent start, but the project also extends the lineage of Komodo (KMD) and takes advantage of Komodo\u2019s notarization mechanism. Komodo recruits all of Bitcoin\u2019s proof of power history \u2014 the most substantial in the world \u2014 as added protection against forgeries.\nAs for useful tech that will be immediately available to the \u201cearly adopter\u201d end users, Verus was the first project to port ZCash\u2019s (ZEC) Sapling technology. Sapling made Z transactions (a very effective kind of privacy transaction) efficient enough to be much more practical for exchanges and much more useable in wallets. And Verus didn\u2019t just port Sapling for itself. Komodo commissioned Verus developers to contribute Sapling code to the entire Komodo ecosystem, which made projects like Pirate (ARRR) much more efficient, and made Pirate\u2019s pitch that exchanges should support Z to Z transactions \u2014 totally private coin transfers \u2014 much more compelling. So, thanks to ZCash, Pirate, Komodo, and Verus, all of the projects in the Komodo ecosystem have the ability to implement much faster Z transactions and we all have options for exchanges that support Z to Z. That\u2019s pretty useful.\nHaving done so much useful, foundational work, the Verus project\u2019s devs did something absolutely mind blowing with self-sovereign IDs. It is amazing to find a project of this size that has made such a significant leap in a capability as fundamental as IDs/addresses. Seriously, VerusIDs are amazing. Namespaces, revocability, and recoverability all at the protocol level.\nA brief summary of just some of the benefit here: a VerusID can be used to send and receive coins just as any other cryptocurrency address. But revocability and recoverability mean that a VerusID can be protected as well. After you set them up these features, if you lose the private keys for an ID, you can revoke access to it and also recover access by associating that ID with a different private key. This is a sea change in how cryptocurrency addressing works and a big step forward for the whole space.\nI\u2019m not an expert on blockchain IDs but I don\u2019t know of any other project that has such an elegant, capable solution. And to tease a single feature that\u2019s currently on Verus testnet \u2014 it will soon be possible to configure Verus addresses so that it\u2019s very unlikely that coins will be stolen or lost. That\u2019s about as useful as current blockchain tech gets.\nSo, all of the above is useful tech. One challenge for general adoption right now, however, is that many of these are innovations at the protocol layer. It may take a while for the UI layer to catch up. I believe the UI layer will catch up though, and the Verus team is currently hard at work on that challenge. Before the UI catches up, IDs are already useful early adopter tech for many use cases. For example, they\u2019re already a significant improvement in terms of cost and efficiency for cryptographic signing \u2014 which may seem like a small use case but it\u2019s not. Verus doesn\u2019t focus on it much but that one use case could, in itself, justify a mega blockchain project.\nBut Verus also isn\u2019t done yet \u2014 not at all, not nearly. When you add IDs to what\u2019s currently visible on testnet, the implications are mind-blowing again. A future, decentralized vision of the Internet \u2014 a future Internet of blockchains \u2014 requires a micro payment system to account for costs. Such a system requires identification for all actors \u2014 humans, software microservices, hardware resources \u2014 everything. The VerusID + the financial technologies that are being developed right now (a suite of equally innovative DeFi capabilities that deserve their own series of articles) are the basic building blocks for all of that.\nIt makes sense that people want to see innovations at the late adopter/grandparent level right now. Though it\u2019s changing rapidly, at this moment, in the whole blockchain space that level is only being addressed by a small handful of services, for example, many projects are making cryptocurrencies useful for financial services. Verus will contribute there as well, but from what I\u2019ve seen the long-term vision is even larger, and the pieces required to realized that vision are in the process of being built.\n**\n\u00b7 This article has more detail about how Verus feature sets such as its DeFi capabilities and VerusID will work and complement each other.\n\u00b7 There\u2019s a Verus channel with a lot more information on specific features.\n\u00b7 The Verus website is a fantastic resource.\n\u00b7 Join the conversation on Discord!\nVerus is a truly decentralized, *community* driven cryptocurrency project. It had a fair launch without a premine and the brilliant team working on it is dedicated to a vision of a better future for all of us.\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: Building the Foundations for a Paradigm Shift\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/building-the-foundations-for-a-paradigm-shift-3146a3adb56e\nContent:\n\nVerus Technical Philosophy: Building the Foundations for a Paradigm Shift\nVerus builds additional blockchain primitives into the consensus protocol in order to provide a robust, secure and scalable foundation for global scale distributed and decentralized apps. Verus\u2019 philosophy is that the decentralized internet will not emerge as a system of applications all programmed on a single \u201cglobal computer\u201d but that it will consist of heterogeneous systems exchanging data that they can all understand (some centralized, some decentralized). Functionality will be triggered from one system to another. Secure systems will include their most important functions at the protocol level.\n\nBell\u2019s Law states that \u201croughly every decade a new, lower priced computer class forms based on a new programming platform, network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new industry\u201d. Experience shows that this shift comes into effect invisibly at first, and its nature is only widely understood and recognized some five to seven years after the shift began.\nWe know that the latest Bell\u2019s Law transformation is upon us, and has been for some years, but there is still scant agreement on its specific nature. What we can say for certain, though, is that we are in dire need of a great leap forward in systems, services and usage. Our most recent computing paradigm has given us new toys, tools and businesses. But it has also brought giant internet monopolies that routinely abuse their power and stifle freedom, innovation and wealth creation. This paradigm is noted for constant security breaches and a perceived impossibility to protect even our most important systems from intrusion. Privacy is a non-feature and is abused at will. The individual has been atomized and vassal-ized, forced to pledge fealty to walled-garden network kings in order to earn a living, to learn or to engage in social or cultural life.\nIn this respect, the preferred benefits of the current Bell\u2019s Law shift would be (i) reduced complexity, (ii) security and privacy as initial and persisting states of the system (not after the fact add-ons), and (iii) self-sovereignty and personal control everywhere. Unreliable, restrictive, extractive centralized services could be replaced by distributed systems that are open and equitable running on reliable public infrastructure.\nVerus is an ambitious project that seeks to provide a foundation for this new programming platform, network and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new industry. Verus seeks to be a foundational part of the current Bell\u2019s Law shift, believing that the decentralized and distributed networks pioneered by Bitcoin have marked the beginning of this shift. The Verus developers bring specific experience in application platform creation and seek to enlarge on this by enabling the global-scale distributed and decentralized systems that mark the new era.\nSecurity as the Ground State\nPublic-key cryptography algorithms are now fundamental ingredients of our data storage, communications and computing systems. But, at the moment, these cryptosystems are not at the core of our computing. Over the last two decades they\u2019ve been layered onto our existing systems through various standards and protocols. The patchwork non-core nature leaves security wanting and difficult to achieve in a lasting and universal way.\nWhat appears to be emerging, though, are systems where security, through asymmetric cryptography, is the ground state. The bitcoin whitepaper laid out \u201can electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust\u201d, thus creating a system that places cryptographic security at its heart. The success of this is self-evident, as the bitcoin system itself has operated openly and continuously since inception, with elegant simplicity and effectively zero security incidents at the protocol level, all while protecting value now measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars.\nVerus shares this philosophy, with cryptographic security as a foundational element of the system. Verus builds on bitcoin, expanding the system beyond payment and into other blockchain primitives such as privacy, finance, identification, data, and interoperability with other decentralized and centralized systems. Verus includes these elements at the protocol level. Still, like bitcoin, Verus uses the UTXO accounting method as opposed to an account-based accounting method, an important benefit of which is that transactions (eg. defi) can be trivially verified in parallel. The philosophy of this structure is to provide a foundation to build global distributed systems and applications. It is the basis to reconstruct computer usage.\nAs part of its philosophy for \u201csecurity as the ground state\u201d, Verus has settled on the Proof of Power mechanism as the foundational security for its network. Although taking over a chain that uses VerusPoP is not impossible, doing so with a 51% attack would require a combined value of over 50% of both the chain\u2019s hashpower and its coin supply. In addition, Verus has built \u201cquantum-ready\u201d capabilities. It remains only to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, following which it will be possible to have all of the transactions sent to an address made retroactively quantum resistant.\nDecentralized Systems Provide Robust, Open Public Infrastructure\nAs Satoshi Nakamato has pointed out in his white paper, a decentralized network has unique elements:\nThe network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their [computing] power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.\nThe robust nature and unstructured simplicity of these networks makes them excellent candidates for public infrastructure. Bitcoin itself is now critical public infrastructure for payments and value.\nThese networks also resist centralized control, allowing for permissionless use by developers and users. In the case of Bitcoin, this means the ability to store and transact value at will. In Ethereum, it means to deploy programmatic logic and to build and use applications on a shared global virtual machine. In Verus, it means to use key blockchain primitives \u2014 privacy, defi, identity, data exchange, interoperability \u2014 as the foundation for a world of distributed apps that are ubiquitous, always on and secure, and that can be used in a way that respects user privacy, sovereignty and control at the most fundamental level.\nVerus has been designed to create a \u201cnaturally decentralized\u201d system, including both miners and stakers. Mining is conducted with the VerusHash algorithm which was developed to equalize mining equitability across hardware classes, and to create a naturally decentralized miner ecosystem. Verus has also prioritized easy onboarding and use for new miners and stakers through the Verus Desktop Wallet, allowing users to easily mine and stake from their wallet. In its current state, Verus has an unusually high number of active nodes (both miners and stakers) in proportion to its market cap, which would be expected to grow further as system take-up grows. A recent estimate from a continuously connected node at the home of a community member showed it had seen over 20,000 node addresses.\nFoundational Blockchains Require Key Primitives\nThe Verus vision is to extend the decentralized network through additional primitives and to make these primitives a first class part of the protocol. The primitives are those necessary to form a reliable foundation for an emerging global distributed network of services. Applications and networks will be built on a basis where security, sovereignty, privacy and interoperability are wired into the core protocol, not added at a second or third layer. This philosophy is quite different from Ethereum and its imitators, which have created very basic blockchain structures as the foundation, with languages running on top that create a sequential computer, in order to provide a basis for applications (where finance, privacy, sovereignty, data and interoperability are intended to be provided by arbitrary applications developers). Verus is convinced that blockchain/application structures of this type are fundamentally difficult to secure and scale. For example, the blockchain doesn\u2019t understand the finance on top of it and so fees can create perverse incentives thus creating security problems. Simply put, the application layer conflicts with the consensus layer.\nInstead, security and scalability can be provided by including key primitives at the consensus level of the protocol. In its current thinking, Verus believes that the following primitives are crucial ingredients for a foundational blockchain system to support the new era of global scale distributed systems:\nPayment \u2014 the last decade shows that large decentralized systems are based on value (typically money/electricity/work). This is a sina qua non primitive and is included in bitcoin and ethereum. In the Verus system, the coin $VRSC represents the payment primitive in the blockchain.\nPrivacy \u2014 as a fork of Zcash, shielded transactions in Verus can be fully encrypted on the blockchain, yet still be verified as valid under the network\u2019s consensus rules by using zk-SNARK proofs.\nFinance \u2014 defi that is built into the protocol has important advantages over defi that is built as an application on a global sequential computer, including security, scalability and fairness. As important, defi must be integrated at the protocol level in order for one decentralized system to \u201cmake a call\u201d to another system, ie. for an ethereum user to seamlessly use the Verus defi protocols or Vault functionality without having to engage Verus or the Verus wallet directly; this type of interconnection creates a truly global application platform that matches the reality of a multitude of computing environments and languages\nIdentity/Agency \u2014 the necessity for users to own their own identity, data, social graphs and reputation is self-evident \u2014 Verus takes this a step further and implements identity as a blockchain primitive, thus enabling what Verus believes to be a core requirement for decentralized identities, a path to recover identity if private keys are lost or stolen\nData \u2014large distributed and decentralized systems (eg the internet) are built on exchange of data; Verus believes that the decentralized internet will consist of heterogeneous systems exchanging data that they can all understand (some centralized, some decentralized), and Verus will enable this through the ability to define and publish data structures at the protocol level, which can then be shared across bridges and gateways\nInteroperability \u2014 Verus works at the protocol level to enable any system to communicate with another in a way that\u2019s reliable and makes sense, using the concepts of \u201cstate root\u201d (a one number root that covers the whole blockchain) and notarization signatures which give the ability to prove transactions that exist on another chain. By enabling full scale interoperability at the protocol level the Verus system does not need a turing complete programmable layer, as required actions can occur on other systems where required provided that systems are exchanging data in a way that they can all understand\nIntegrated Blockchain Creation \u2014the path to virtually unlimited scalability lies in the ability to provision additional interoperable blockchains at will, without the necessity to provision additional resources (hardware, wallets, etc.). Verus enables this through its PBaaS system where any blockchain can be used to provision a new blockchain that is immediately interoperable to every other Verus blockchain (and thereby to the greater blockchain universe) and has immediate access to the installed base of Verus\u2019 miners, stakers, wallets, apps, etc. These new blockchains inherit Verus\u2019 security through a system of notarization into the main Verus blockchain.\nThe effect of the design philosophy is to allow functionality that securely and permissionlessly goes across systems, whether from one Verus blockchain to another, or to other blockchain systems such as Ethereum. Functionality can be triggered from one system to another. The fundamental idea is that in the real world we have multitudes of environments and languages, and things connect through data. There is no requirement for a \u201cglobal computer\u201d that runs applications using a single language \u2014 in fact, that method presents clear scaling challenges, and is insecure as value and fees drift to the application layer and are unrecognizable at the protocol level. Instead Verus lays out the fundamental primitives and then application systems are built around that, communicating through data. Verus has currently implemented payment, privacy and identity on its mainnet. Defi at the protocol level is in operation on testnet. Interoperability and blockchain creation is joining on testnet shortly, with data exchange to follow shortly thereafter.\nOnce these protocols are in place to serve as public infrastructure, Verus expects rapid uptake for users and developers of all kinds to continue building and using the applications of the new era.\nDiscuss and explore on Discord\nFollow us on Twitter\nGo to our website\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: Jul-Oct 2022\u200a\u2014\u200aVerus Monthly Recap\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/jul-oct-2022-verus-monthly-recap-dc7785519867\nContent:\n\nJul-Oct 2022 \u2014 Verus Monthly Recap\nThe latest Verus updates on development, community, ecosystem and more.

This release updates the Komodo notaries to season 6 and you must update to reliably stay synchronized to the Verus mainnet (activation height of block 2,291,830).\nv0.9.5 introduces 2 new APIs and CLI commands, signdata and verifysignature, that encompass all of the capabilities of previous signing and verification APIs and add new capabilities for advanced signatures and verification \u2014 a more powerful and flexible framework for NFTs and ID-bound legal rights and agreements.\nIn addition to digital signing of documents or information using an ID, the new APIs enable easily binding together multiple sources of content, documents, identities, and VDXF keys together into one verifiable signature and then being able to verify that signature, including all of its specific bindings.\n\ud83d\udd17 Download Verus Desktop v0.9.5\n\nVerus PBaaS & DeFi Updates\nIn anticipation of the Verus PBaaS mainnet upgrade \u2014 delivering no-programming needed blockchain and currency launches, MEV-free DeFi, non-custodial Ethereum bridging and so much more \u2014 community developers introduce a protocol improvement designed to make the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol even more resistant than what we believe was already the leading algorithm to multi-block attempts at MEV.\nThe protocol improvement makes the following adjustments:\nConversions and cross-chain transfers still roll-up into exports that are collected from one or more blocks of transfer transactions, but to determine when a block is the last of the prior export or first in the next requires a random bit pulled from later blocks.\nThe last miner or staker to complete a block of an export retroactively receives 10% of all fees from processing that export, including all conversions, once the rollup is processed as an import. This reward used to go to the miner or staker who processes the export, which is no longer the case.\nImport transactions can now include up to n/2 arbitrage transactions, where n is the number of reserves in a liquidity basket currency.\nThese changes together serve to disincentivize any miner or staker from attempting to exclude a large set of transactions from a block and front run all of them, as they will have an even chance of having all of those excluded transactions put back in with their transaction, turning potential gain into potential loss. They would be better off saving their working capital to arbitrage imports by joining transactions, bringing them close to market, and earning money without risk of loss. In addition, if they do end up putting more value of transactions in a block that caps the export rollup, they will reliably earn meaningful rewards without risk of loss in that way as well.\nBug Bounties \ud83d\udcb0\nWhile we don\u2019t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended.\nIf anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 VRSC.\n\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f See PBaaS-Testnet Release Notes\n\ud83d\udece\ufe0f Join Discord and report bounties\n\nIntroducing VerusID to Verus Mobile\nThis version of Verus Mobile takes a major leap forward, enabling support for VerusID, including sending and receiving funds and use of your VerusID as a password-free, secure and self-sovereign web or mobile app sign-in, made possible with the VerusID authentication protocol.\nVerus Mobile v0.3.0\u201324 supports the version 1.0 of the VerusID authentication protocol, which prepares for the PBaaS upgrade and supports application provisioning of IDs, an important way applications can onboard users, give them a verified self-sovereign ID and funds address, enable sending and receiving payments, and make applications more secure by design with an easy, password-free sign-in.\nIn addition to its new support for VerusID and the Verus Authentication Protocol, this version of Verus Mobile continues to include Wyre as a fiat on-ramp and maintains support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a variety of popular coins and tokens.\nIf you are an app developer who wants to benefit from and help pioneer a better, more user-centric, inherently commerce-enabled, verifiable application model for a true Internet of Value, this is the release that enables you!

Verus offers a different perspective and a new approach. Together we will come to the conclusion that the Verus Protocol solves scalability by neither sacrificing decentralization or security, effectively solving the trilemma.\n\nA Closer Look at the Trilemma\nBefore we dive in, let\u2019s examine the current perceived definition of the crypto trilemma: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a scalable blockchain that is truly decentralized and thus secure\u201d \u2014 it is said to achieve worldwide scalability a blockchain needs to be fast so it can process all the transactions for a large population (btw, this is a false premise, you can read about that later.) And to get a fast, high tps (transactions per second) blockchain it must compromise on decentralization and thus security.\nDecentralization and security go hand-in-hand. A truly decentralized protocol (open to all, many validators) is secure because it is difficult to 51% attack such a protocol. If a blockchain is less decentralized (low number of validators, permissioned access) it could be 51% attacked (by external attackers or colluding validators), and transactions can be altered or reversed, completely undermining one of the goals of blockchain \u2014 censorship-resistance.\nThe trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the world.\nThere is truth to the fact that it is very difficult to have a decentralized single blockchain that also has a high tps. The larger the number of validators the harder it is to find consensus among them all, which makes them slower, and makes it more difficult to get them to process large numbers of transactions. To get a high tps blockchain you would need to lower the number of validators so they can find consensus more easily, and raise the hardware requirements for running a node so they can process those transactions quicker too. Yet doing so compromises true decentralization. The lower the number of validators, the less decentralized, the less robust. And the higher the hardware requirements, the less accessible it is for people around the world, the less decentralized.\nThe trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the world. We will show you how Verus offers a new and better approach.\nScalability Does NOT Mean High Tps\nTransactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator \u2014 like GHz for computers.\nCryptocurrency protocols often boast about how fast their blockchains are (transactions per second) as an indicator of their scalability. Contrary to popular belief this is a false premise. Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator. Like how we use GHz (CPU clock speed) to indicate how fast a computer is, or an even better example \u2014 how fast servers are.\nTo bring the promise of crypto to billions of people around the globe let\u2019s make a comparison with the Internet. The Internet does not run on one single server. All websites and applications that we use daily are not connected to one single server. The Internet has not been scaled to the world by constantly upgrading the one server to a faster one. It\u2019s millions of servers that are servicing billions of people around the world. These millions of servers are perfectly connected, and completely interoperable so that using the Internet today is a seamless experience.\nNow, with this perspective in mind, let\u2019s get back to the current situation in crypto land. Most, if not all, crypto protocols are trying to service the world with their one single, monolithic blockchain. The monolithic blockchain becomes a central hub where all smart contracts and applications revolve around. When they notice that it doesn\u2019t scale (the transaction fees start ramping up) the industry comes up with solutions that heavily compromise on decentralization and security (e.g. L2s, semi-centralized protocols, master nodes). This is not the answer.\nInstead of acknowledging that the Internet today is a giant, interconnected multi-server world where all applications and websites are seamlessly connected, most of the crypto industry thinks we live in a single server (single blockchain) world.\nVerus acknowledged that to realize the promise of cryptocurrency and blockchain, it needed to scale for billions of people around the globe and thus it needed to embrace a multi-server, multi-chain world. And that is exactly what the Verus Protocol does today. Without sacrificing decentralization and security.\nUnlimited in Scale\nBefore we start explaining how Verus is truly decentralized and secure, let\u2019s start with how Verus embraces the multi-chain world and delivers unlimited scalability.\nMost, if not all, current blockchain protocols argue that to have low transaction fees they must achieve higher transactions per second. They try to scale up \u2014 increasing the performance of their monolithic blockchains. This only gets them so far. At some point, they will bottleneck again, and in the process, they compromise on decentralization and security.\nVerus offers a new approach, one in which each organization or business can launch its own highly capable, rent-free, no-coding-required blockchain. It\u2019s called Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service). These PBaaS-chains are fully independent, can be customized to the organization\u2019s need, inherit all the same features as the Verus blockchain, and most importantly are fully interconnected and interoperable with the complete network and other bridged protocols (e.g. Ethereum). A single PBaaS-chain can do between 75 and 800 tps depending on the options chosen.\nThere is no upper limit to deploying PBaaS-chains. Just like there is no upper limit to servers being deployed. When we reach a bandwidth limit we don\u2019t go out upgrading our single server, we put another server next to it to spread out the usage. The same thing is here, reaching unlimited scalability.\nOf course, this only works when those PBaaS-chains are fully interoperable and interconnected, which they are \u2014 in a provable, trustless and decentralized way. There is no centralized entity sitting in between the PBaaS-chains regulating everything.\nCross-chain transactions and conversions, cross-chain bridging of identities (VerusID), tokens and basket currencies, even Ethereum (& ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155) \u2014 it\u2019s all built into the consensus mechanism, trustlessly bridged over by the decentralized network of miners and stakers only. This is all on mainnet now, for everyone to use.\nWe can conclude that Verus is scalable to billions of people around the world with the unlimited deployment of PBaaS-chains. But does it compromise on decentralization and thus security? Let\u2019s dive into it.\nVerus lead developer Mike Toutonghi explains how unlimited scalability is achieved.\nBuilt to be Decentralized\nThere are a few things at play here that work in harmony to achieve decentralization and security \u2014 Verus Proof of Power (the hybrid 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake consensus mechanism), merge-mining and the Fee Pool.\nVerus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or tax.\nBefore we jump into the above let\u2019s acknowledge some facts that are pivotal to being a true decentralized protocol, to being credibly neutral. Just like Bitcoin before, Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or tax. Verus is not a company or a business. Verus is rent-free and all protocol fees go to the block producers. These facts are super important to incentivize decentralization and to be a credibly neutral protocol in the eyes of the world.\nA Hybrid Consensus Mechanism\nNow let\u2019s unpack Verus Proof of Power, the consensus mechanism of the Verus blockchain, and all PBaaS-chains. It\u2019s a hybrid of 50% proof-of-work and 50% proof-of-stake, and it\u2019s a provable solution to 51% hash attacks. Out of the 1440 daily blocks (on Verus, and when a PBaaS-chain opts for 1-minute block times), half is solved by mining and half by staking.\nVerusHash, the proof-of-work mechanism which disincentivizes ASIC & FPGA development, and favors CPUs, mobile phones and ARM-devices for mining. Mining with mobile phones and for example, Orange Pi 5\u2019s are the most cost-efficient way to do it. This proves a significant leap towards a more inclusive mining environment. It\u2019s accessible to everyone and thus creates a naturally decentralized protocol.\nAn Orange Pi 5 mining farm by community member DCAL4.\nAdditionally, to give even more power to miners, they can merge-mine up to 22 PBaaS-chains simultaneously without sacrificing their original hashing power. This dramatically increases efficiency and network security. So, when considering an unlimited number of PBaaS-chains on the network, each miner can choose up to 22 to mine. They can choose for profitability, or choose the ones they want to support.\nThis approach to mining is environmentally conscious. The protocol\u2019s design allows for low-power devices to mine extremely efficiently. It lowers the entry barrier for participation in blockchain validation, especially in low-income countries, yet can also give life to phones that are old or with broken screens. Thus significantly reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW mining.\nThen we have the proof-of-stake part of the consensus mechanism. This one is really simple and powerful. Anyone can run a node and start staking. There is no minimum amount of VRSC needed (pretty unique in the world of PoS). Verus solved the \u201cnothing-at-stake\u201d-problem therefore there is no slashing of funds. Funds staking are never locked and running a node can be done with something as cheap as a Raspberry Pi 4. All-in-all proving yet again that Verus is accessible to everyone, creating a naturally decentralized protocol.\nWe can conclude that Verus is truly a decentralized protocol, naturally emerging from its extremely low-barrier mining and staking. So what does that mean for security?\nProtocol Security at Another Level\nSeeing as the Verus Protocol is naturally decentralized and provable 51% hash attack resistant, it\u2019s extremely secure. PBaaS-chains take these properties with them as they have the same consensus mechanism, and the Verus miners can choose up to 21 of them to merge-mine. It\u2019s fair to say that there is no compromise on security given the scalability of the protocol.\nVerus Introduces the Fee Pool\nLet\u2019s first explain the fees the protocol generates for the miners and stakers:\nPBaaS-chain launches: 10,000 VRSC (5,000 for the block producers of Verus, 5,000 for the block producers of the newly launched chain)\nCurrency launches (tokens, basket currencies, liquidity pools, ERC-20 mapped currencies): 200 VRSC\nVerusID registrations: 100, 80, 60, 40 or 20 VRSC\nsubID registrations: 0.02 VRSC\nDeFi conversion fees: min. 0.0125%, max. 0.025%\nTransaction fees: 0.0001 VRSC\nBuilders and users pay these protocol fees for their operations and the fees are directed into the Fee Pool. Then, for each new block, 1% of the Fee Pool is added on top of the regular coinbase reward (currently 6 VRSC).\nThe Fee Pool is introduced as a security measure to keep the protocol stable. We have seen in other blockchain protocols that when a block has large fees, block producers try to \u201csnipe\u201d the block (putting lots of hash onto the network, then pulling it out of the network, or even trying to reorder the blocks for their own gain). In doing so they destabilize the protocol. Verus mitigates this behavior by spreading the extra fees over many blocks.\nSmart Contracts Are Not Secure\nMost blockchain protocols use the VM-based application model \u2014 smart contracts written with Solidity. It\u2019s full of smart contract hacks and bugs and has insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms. On top of that MEV (maximum extractable value) is rampant, due to the serial processing of transactions on the VM-model (it\u2019s easy for a block producer to reorder transactions inside a block for their own gain). We can honestly say that the VM-model is not secure.\nThe Verus approach is different as it follows the fundamental systems design principle \u2014 the most important security layers should be located in the protocol itself, and not coded on top via L2 (smart contracts). All operations on Verus and PBaaS-chains are directly connected to consensus, secured by the miners and stakers of the protocol.\nNow you might ask yourself \u201cBut can we build dApps that are as capable as building them with the VM-model?\u201d. The answer is yes. Developing dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions.\nDoes Verus Solve the Blockchain Trilemma?\nA fair question. And hopefully we answered with enough detail. The answer is \u201cyes!\u201d.\nLet\u2019s summarize. Verus does not compromise on decentralization and security to reach unlimited scalability. Unlimited scalability is reached by scaling out, not scaling up. It is the equivalent not of upgrading your server but of putting an extra server next to it to spread the bandwidth around.\nDecentralization is achieved by making mining and staking accessible for everyone through extremely low hardware requirements. This naturally creates a large number of miners and nodes (stakers), making the network robust against attacks of all sorts.\nHigh security is not only reached through the decentralized nature of the network but also because of the Fee Pool and the fact that all operations are directly connected to consensus and thus the miners and stakers.\nNow is the Time to Build with Verus\nWithout having to rely on smart contracts, builders can develop dApps that are even more powerful, secure and scalable. Builders can use the no-coding-required API commands, together with VerusID and its VDXF (Verus Data Exchange Format) as a controlled public storage system with multiple levels of nesting to create dApps of any kind.\nThe foundation has been laid for a true Internet of Value.

In a new era of blockchain where I, along with mostly everyone else in mainstream crypto, believed CPU mining was an inefficient and outdated method best kept tucked away with the Bitcoin whitepaper and those lucky bastards who first mined BTC in its inception days, this sounded cool but didn\u2019t really impress me, in and of itself.\nWhen I finally decided to head over to Verus and take a look at what the project was all about, I felt like a sea-weary sailor spotting a glimpse of a distant lighthouse\u2026if I dare sound a little corny\u2026 but was still uncertain how sure the ground was, upon which it claimed to be founded.\nPeople and Development Strong\nI immediately noticed two things about the project: first, there was no \u201cteam\u201d, just contributors with the invitation to join the community as yet another member. Second, the project was quietly doing the best development work I had seen yet, without any glitz or glam. Being a developer myself with a solid 2 years in crypto in the capacity of researching and understanding projects, their quality of work, vision, and the condition of the market and industry\u2026meant I was poised for having an eye for identifying that special \u201csomething.\u201d\nAs I began to dig further, it occurred to me just how outstanding the development work really was, just how strong a foundation and how real the land was for which I had been sailing.\nGrowing up in California and frequently visiting Nevada City and the gold mines, hearing the tales of treasure sought and sacrifices made for such pursuit of real gold\u2026and the \u201cfool\u2019s gold\u201d designed to mimic the real deal which the museum curator would show us\u2026that childlike wonder rushed back, accompanied with the sensations of being an adult who often wished I had discovered Bitcoin earlier and been more integral in it\u2019s revolutionary movement in our world.\nVerus was doing something different, something no one else was doing. The developers made things, incredible things, and then told people it was done and how to use it, leverage it, etc. The \u201clighthouse\u201d of my recognition did has not disappointed in revealing the existence of the solid ground beneath it\u2026the Verus project and community.\nBecoming a Contributor\nAs I began to study the vision paper and really delve into the project, get to know the community, and the developers, it became even clearer how true this is, how truly Verus is like the solid ground in an ever changing and surging sea of uncertainty, and how well it provides a foundation for building sound and secured structures, systems, economies, and virtually any sort of application for use in society and the future of peer to peer money.\nAfter a few weeks of involvement as a miner and community member, simply learning and gleaning, I began to get involved in trying to help others as a periodical contributor within the community as well. Then my buddy Ben looped me in on a conversation with Mike Toutonghi in regards to contributing more regularly, my love for writing and do a couple articles for the project.\nIn a matter of a few months of my own personal involvement with the project I\u2019ve witnessed the most impressive development and strides I\u2019ve ever seen a blockchain project take with such finesse, speed and accuracy. I\u2019m so excited and grateful to be a part of this community and this vision.\nSolving the Biggest Problems in Blockchain\nIn just 8 months Verus solved the theoretical problem of \u201cnothing at stake\u201d through a solution that incorporates decentralization and incentivizes fair play while making it an economically losing proposition to try cheating at Proof of Stake and technically improbable/unlikely. Verus then went on to solve the problem of weak subjectivity while developing a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Power. Proof of Power is immune to 51% hash attacks as proven in the mathematical paper which Verus developers released shortly after releasing the consensus mechanism to the Verus blockchain.\nFor anyone who isn\u2019t so tech savvy, these three issues (Nothing at Stake on a PoS consensus, Weak Subjectivity, and 51% Hash Attacks) are arguably the top three biggest threats which face blockchain technology\u2026and all three have been solved in a matter of months on the Verus blockchain and, in turn, for all blockchains stood up on the Verus system as autochains. Not only did Verus solve these, they have proven the 51% hash attack solution mathematically and implemented it in practice in forks and upgrades that are now live as the current Verus blockchain today.\nAnother major event last year, Verus incorporated the Zcash Sapling upgrade, the largest upgrade to the Zcash code yet, equipping Verus with lightning fast and resource light zk-SNARK transactions. This was a massive upgrade and positioned the Verus blockchain further in terms of the goals of Public Blockchain as a Service. As a part of this upgrade Verus also incorporated smart contracts through an enhanced implementation of Komodo\u2019s \u201cCrypto Conditions\u201d which allowed for features like Stake Guard, the mechanism which allows for solving the Nothing at Stake problem.\nAs a friendly collaborative gesture and in the spirit of open source, Verus then shared the Sapling upgrade tech upstream with Komodo, who in turn, forked their entire ecosystem with Sapling\u2026while allowing asset chains the option to opt-out (which 2 did).\nAs 2018 drew to a close it became known that a small group of FPGA miners were secretly mining Verus at a significantly higher hash-rate than the fastest GPU. Verus developers reached out to the company selling the bitstream and offered to cooperate, with decentralization and equalization key factors, along with open source of the bitstream being a necessary ingredient. Having not arrived at an agreement, the Verus developers made the choice to improve the VerusHash to better equalize hardware types, and just this past month released VerusHash 2.0.\nThe VerusHash 2.0 fork was one of the smoothest and well executed forks I\u2019ve ever witnessed, the hash rate and difficulty adjusting smoothly, without a hitch at the block height of the fork and on. And a massive response in CPU mining. The fork reasserted decentralization and provided a platform for better hardware equalization going forward as Verus develops PBaaS.\nLooking Back at 2018\nThese are just some of the major examples of what this exciting project achieved through the active involvement and contributions by all the community, devs and lead dev Mike Toutonghi included. After the 100% fair launch of VerusCoin on May 21 2018, in just roughly 7 months, it\u2019s staggering how much Verus accomplished and how much the Verus community has grown, matured, and thrived regardless of the cryptocurrency climate.\nIt\u2019s a challenge to fit all that has been achieved in that short 7 months into a single update, while truly giving each individual achievement and community contributor the acknowledgement they deserve.\nFollowing is not an exhaustive list, there are so many updates, improvements, and lots of little things along the way including coin listings, it would be ridiculously long! But I drew out what I felt are the big highlights. Many of these highlights included more than a single community member or developer. To learn more about each you can peruse the Verus discord Announcements channel.\nSome highlights from 2018:\nMay 21\u2013100% fair launch (no ico/no premine) announced on BCT\nJune 12 \u2014 FAQ Bounty Offerings Announced to community\nJune 13 \u2014 Vision Paper, White Paper Phase I, new website, Twitter, Reddit\u2026 all released\nJuly 7 \u2014 Listing on Digital Price, first exchange listing\nJuly 30 \u2014 Announcement of Verus Foundation formation\nAug 14 \u2014 First community member operated pools online\nSep 9 \u2014 Released electrum servers, Lite mode Agama, and first GPU miners!\nSep 10 \u2014 Mobile development underway and announced\nOct 15 \u2014 Sapling Update released & fork announced\nOct 30 \u2014 Sapling fork at 227520, a seamless fork to latest upgrade which incorporates Sapling and a modified Crypto Conditions \u201cStake Guard\u201d solving nothing at stake\nNov 15 \u2014 Proof of Power paper published, proving Verus PoP consensus\u2019 immunity to 51% hash attacks\nNov 27 \u2014 Verus upstreams Sapling modifications and VerusHash 1.0 to Komodo\nDec 13 \u2014 AAcoin launches unique exchange-staking pool for VRSC\nDec 20 \u2014 VerusHash 2.0 Released with Verus update v0.5.0 and fork date announced.

There are so many active contributors in the Verus community and I really want to express my personal gratitude to each and every one. I want to mention just a few of those who I\u2019ve noted some significant participation, contribution, in some way.\nMike Toutonghi\nMichael Toutonghi Jr\nDavid Dawes\nAsher Dawes\nAlex English\nJL777\nGodballz\nChris \u2014 LOUD Mining Dev-Ops\n0x03\nGinasis Mining Pools\nKryptoshi\nAelder\nPaia\nGrewalsatinder\nRunningwithbeer\nMeyse\nRegnar\nStretcher83\nMammothine\nBitopia\nHellcatz\nIf I left anyone out I\u2019m sorry! Know that I\u2019m deeply appreciative to every fellow community member!\nResonating with Something Deeper\nWith the innovative and, dare I say brilliant, development work by lead developer Mike Toutonghi as another community contributor able to deliver quality, working and revolutionary code and solutions swiftly and smoothly..and a host of talented developers, committed contributors, miners, stakers\u2026the Verus community is an evolving decentralized ecosystem of participants working together toward the Verus vision and building a bright and thriving future society, economy and integral implementations of blockchain technology within, in my opinion, the most secure, well grounded, and best-suited blockchain system yet seen in the industry.\nFor me it is exactly the sort of project I\u2019ve been looking for, it resonates with my philosophies of decentralization, with my principles of privacy, with my own desire and vision of a society which is better equipped for supporting freedom, privacy, truth, voice, and positive economy in which people are able to be in control of their own identity, money, opinions, time, and attention.\nIt is, in my opinion, the next logical step for Bitcoin and in total sync and alignment with the original Bitcoin whitepaper and Satoshi himself.\nAs I\u2019ve grown to learn more about the Verus vision, understand the tech better, and spend time with the other Verus contributors, including Mike and other devs, my passion and love for this project continue to expand and deepen.\nIt\u2019s About Community\nI\u2019m excited to be contributing on the regular now-a-days and doing my part for the community to help shine more light on the incredible project which Verus is, to help guide others who, like me, are feeling a little lost in the sea and looking for solid land again. On that note, I want to invite anyone who is looking for meaning in cryptocurrency and blockchain to join the Verus community!\nWhile much of crypto is about buying coins to try and strike it rich, vapor ware projects selfishly pursuing their own profit or greed through well-written pitches, Verus is something rare. A project that is totally decentralized, community based, and actually building real solutions and tools for a future economy and for decentralized blockchain applications\u2026which is already proven in its development base and is established in solving the biggest problems (real and theoretical) in blockchain\u2026it\u2019s as rare as was bitcoin when it first took showed up.\nSure, you can buy Verus Coin and stake it, earning rewards for helping to secure the blockchain via Proof of Stake...or even mine VRSC with modern CPUs, helping in the decentralization and security of the Proof of Work side of consensus. But honestly the best way you can get Verus Coin is by joining the community and helping out, becoming a part of the \u201chuman network\u201d of decentralized contributors and members who are making Verus the thriving project, community and ecosystem it is fast becoming.\nIf you would like to learn more about Verus Coin and get involved in any way, whether in mining and helping secure the blockchain or through contributing and joining the community (or both!), visit the official site at https://veruscoin.io and join the official Verus Discord.\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: How to Update/Install VerusCoin Graphical (GUI) Wallet to Latest Version\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-to-update-veruscoin-graphical-gui-wallet-to-0-4-0a-for-linux-686fc7a5b6e7\nContent:\n\nHow to Update VerusCoin Graphical (GUI) Wallet to Latest Version\nStep-by-step for updating to the latest version of Verus GUI wallet on Ubuntu Linux and Windows\n\nIn this post I\u2019ll walk through the steps to updating to the latest Verus (GUI) from a previous release. These steps may also be used for performing a fresh install of the latest Verus wallet, including installing the wallet in tandem on a system which already has Agama by Komodo installed.\nVerus wallet is an modified and enhanced build of Agama. Verus includes enhancements such as mining, staking, and latest zero knowledge Sapling features built in. Because Verus wallet is a build of Agama, relying on the same daemon (komodod) in the background, installing it side by side, on a system already containing Agama by Komodo does take a little finesse to ensure both wallets work correctly, when all is said and done.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\nAll nodes, CLI or GUI, must be v0.5.3 or later (0.5.1 on Mac) unless otherwise announced on the official Verus Discord or Medium. Please update your wallet immediately if you are running an older version.\nDownload binary for your OS: \nhttps://veruscoin.io/#download\nFor ALL step-by-steps below, be sure to shutdown Agama and/or Verus wallet and backup your wallet.dat files for ALL coins you have activated. In Step 1 of each section below I\u2019ll walk you through the process of creating a backup of your entire hidden komodo folder, which includes your wallet files, just for good measure.\nGraphical Wallet (GUI) \u2014 Linux and Windows\nIn Linux it\u2019s easiest to do much of the work from a terminal but many of the steps can be performed either from the terminal or by using your desktop environment. That said, for Linux steps I\u2019ll be using the Terminal commands in the following steps.\nSTEP 1 \u2014 Backup hidden komodo folder, including wallet.dat files (If updating Verus, or installing Verus alongside an existing Agama install)\nLinux:\nOpen a new terminal and navigate to your home folder with cd ~\nCopy the entire hidden .komodo folder to a backup location. The easiest is to issue the command cp .komodo BK-komodo\nRemove the old version of Verus, if you are updating. Simply delete the Verus application folder you previously had extracted.\nWindows:\nClick Start and type %appdata% and press ENTER\nCopy the \u201cKomodo\u201d folder found within to \u201cBK-komodo\u201d\nRemove the old version of Verus, if you are updating. You can simply delete the Verus application folder you previously had extracted.\nSTEP 2 \u2014 Get Latest Version of Verus GUI Wallet\nDownload the latest version from one of the following official locations: \nhttps://veruscoin.io/#download\nUnzip the application folder where you would like (e.g. Desktop) and rename it to something like \u201cVerus v0.N\u201d where \u201cN\u201d is the current version number, so it\u2019s easier to track which wallet and version you\u2019re running.\nMost users can skip ahead to Step 5\u2026if, however, you have any issues with syncing, follow Steps 3 and 4.\nSTEP 3 (Optional) \u2014 Get Recent VRSC Bootstrap\nIf this is your first time installing, or you had any issues with updating or syncing, you may want to download the Bootstrap of VRSC which can speed up the Verus sync process.\nLinux:\nFrom the terminal, navigate to your home folder with cd ~ and download the latest VRSC bootstrap by issuing the following command:\nwget https://bootstrap.0x03.services/veruscoin/VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz\nDelete the contents of your ~/.komodo/VRSC folder, ensuring your wallet.dat file was backed up in Step 1.\nAfter the download completes, unpack the file into your .komodo/VRSC folder with the following command:\ntar -xvf VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz -C .komodo/VRSC\nWindows:\nOpen your browser and paste the following URL\nhttps://bootstrap.0x03.services/veruscoin/VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz\nYou may need 7-Zip to unzip this file.\nDelete the contents of your %appdata%\\Komodo\\VRSC folder, ensuring your wallet.dat file was backed up in Step 1.\nWhen the file completes downloading, unzip the contents into the following folder: %appdata%\\Komodo\\VRSC\nNote:\nNew wallet.dat files will be generated in these folders during the first launch of the updated Verus wallet while it syncs up, you\u2019ll overwrite these files later with your backed-up wallet if you are updating.\nSTEP 4 (Optional) \u2014 Get Recent KMD Bootstrap\nIf you are installing Verus alongside a version of Komodo\u2019s Agama wallet, or you would like support for KMD native within Verus wallet, you\u2019ll need to sync the entire Komodo blockchain again due to the new Zcash Params which come with this latest version of Verus. Since the KMD blockchain is so large, it\u2019s recommended to download a recent bootstrap to save time syncing.\nLinux:\nFrom the terminal, navigate to your home folder with cd ~ and download the latest KMD bootstrap by issuing the following command:\nwget https://bootstrap.0x03.services/komodo/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz\nAfter the download completes, unpack the file into your .komodo folder with the following command:\ntar -xvf KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz -C .komodo\nWindows:\nOpen your browser and paste the following URL\nhttps://bootstrap.0x03.services/komodo/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz\nYou may need 7-Zip to unzip this file.\nWhen the file completes downloading, unzip the contents into the following folder: %appdata%\\Komodo\nSTEP 5 \u2014 First, Launch Verus Wallet\nOn first launch of the newly updated Verus wallet choose VRSC under the \u201cNative Mode\u201d drop down.\nYou\u2019ll receive a modal prompt to download the latest Zcash Params, follow the steps to do so.\nAfter the Zcash Params have completed downloading, close the modal and again select VRSC from \u201cNative Mode\u201d\nVerus will launch and begin to sync. This process may take a few minutes. Allow the sync to reach 100% before proceeding.\nSTEP 6 (Optional) \u2014 Enabling KMD\nIf you\u2019re including KMD support in your Verus wallet, or installing Verus alongside Agama, you\u2019ll want to follow this step.\nAfter Verus wallet has been launched and synced up with VerusCoin, close the wallet and wait for it to shut down completely before proceeding.\nLaunch Verus wallet and choose KMD from the \u201cNative Mode\u201d drop down list.\nKomodo will launch and begin to sync. This process may take a few minutes. Allow the sync to reach 100%.\nAfter Komodo has fully synced, it is safe to click \u201cActivate Coin\u201d and add VRSC in Native mode. It may take some time, but after several minutes both wallets will display, both in Native mode at 100% each.\nSTEP 7 (Optional) \u2014 Restore wallet.dat Files (If You Followed Steps 3 and 4)\nIf you are performing an update and followed Steps 3 and 4 above in which you cleared out the contents of your hidden VRSC and Komodo folders, you now need to restore your original wallet.dat files.\nFirst close Verus wallet and wait for it to shut down completely.\nCopy your backed up wallet.dat files back into their appropriate folders \nLinux: KMD wallet.dat file goes into /home/yourusername/.komodo and Verus wallet.dat file goes into /home/yourusername/.komodo/VRSC Windows: KMD wallet.dat file goes into %appdata%/Komodo and Verus wallet.dat file goes into %appdata%/Komodo/VRSC\nTo restore the backup we created in Step 1, simply do the following:\nLinux\n-In a Terminal window, go to your home folder: cd ~ \n-Restore KMD Wallet with: cp BK-komodo/wallet.dat .komodo\n-Restore VRSC Wallet with: cp BK-komodo/VRSC/wallet.dat .komodo/VRSC\nWindows\n-Click Start and type %appdata% then hit ENTER. \n-Copy the wallet.dat file within the BK-komodo folder and paste into the Komodo folder. \n-Within BK-komodo folder, open the VRSC folder and copy the wallet.dat file, then paste into the VRSC folder found within the Komodo folder.\nSTEP 8 \u2014 Clean up\nAfter verifying everything works, your wallets are restored and showing balances (if you did an update), and that everything is syncing correctly, you can clean up a little to save space on your drive.\nFor example, you can remove the BK-komodo folder, although I would ensure ALL wallet files are restored and/or backed up elsewhere first.\nYou may also want to remove any old versions of Verus wallet or Agama, name the new application folders appropriately, create links, etc.\nLastly, it\u2019s safe to delete the Bootstrap files you downloaded and can save a few GB of space. If you need to do any updates in the future you\u2019ll want to download recent bootstraps for that time to make most use of them, so deleting these is no problem.\nResources and About Verus\nTo learn more about VerusCoin, visit https://veruscoin.io and join the official Verus Discord.\nVerusCoin Successfully Activates Sapling, Plus More Improvements\nVerus Coin 0.4.0 Official Release Notes\nVerus Pocket Guide \u2014 Start Here\nHow Verus Solved Proof of Stake problem \u201cNothing at Stake\u201d\nEverything You Need to Know About the Sapling Upgrade\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: How-to Participate in the Verus-Ethereum Bridge Launch\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-to-participate-in-the-verus-ethereum-bridge-launch-73aeeae1c76a\nContent:\n\nHow-to Participate in the Verus-Ethereum Bridge Launch\nThis article gives instructions on how to use the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website and Verus Desktop and Verus Mobile to preconvert ETH, DAI and MKR into Bridge.vETH.\n\nFirst I recommend to read: Bridging Done Right \u2014 Verus-Ethereum Bridge Launches Now!\n\u2705 We will show you:\nHow-to bridge ETH, DAI & MKR over to Verus\nHow-to enable vETH, DAI.vETH & MKR.vETH on Verus Desktop & Verus Mobile\nHow-to preconvert into Bridge.vETH with Verus Desktop & Verus Mobile\nDownload the latest Verus Desktop or Verus Mobile (iOS App Store or Android Play Store)\nIf on Verus Desktop make sure you are on native mode and fully synced. (And remember to always backup your wallet.dat file!)\nVisit the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website here: https://eth.verusbridge.io/\nBridging ETH, DAI & MKR over to Verus\nFirst thing we need to do, before we can preconvert, is to bridge over. To bridge ETH, DAI or MKR over you need to visit the bridge website here.\n\nThen connect your Metamask or WalletConnect wallet. Follow the steps they give you.\n\nThen fill in the address (R- or i-address) you want the bridged ETH, DAI or MKR to end up.\n\nThen choose what you want to bridge over (ETH, DAI, MKR or VRSC). And then the destination. After that choose the amount and click send.\nMetamask or WalletConnect will guide you through the next steps. \u26a0\ufe0f It can take up to 45 minutes before your bridged ETH, DAI or MKR arrives on the Verus blockchain and in your wallet.\n\u26fd Also, the gas fee calculation is quite high, it could be that you pay a lot less, but this is never a guarantee.\nGetting Verus Desktop to show vETH, DAI.vETH & MKR.vETH\nNow that you have sent over ETH, DAI or MKR to your R- or i-address, we need to make sure you can actually see them in Verus Desktop.\n\nGo to the \u201cMultiverse\u201d-tab, click on Verus on the left. You can see that Bridge.vETH, DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH & vETH or not \u201cadded\u201d yet. Click on one of the currencies.\n\nWhen clicking on one of the currencies you can see a button \u201cAdd Currency\u201d. Click on it, and do it for all if you want.\nYou can now go back to the \u201cWallet\u201d-tab.\n\nYou can now see the added currencies in the dropdown in your Wallet-tab (when Verus is selected).\nGetting Verus Mobile to show vETH, DAI.vETH & MKR.vETH\nFor this step we assume you already have the wallet installed and are ready to go. Now that you have sent over ETH, DAI or MKR to your R- or i-address, we need to make sure you can actually see them in Verus Mobile.\n\nClick on the big plus button in the right bottom corner. Then click \u201cAdd PBaaS Currency\u201d.\nThen you can type in vETH (or DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH depending on what you want to add). (not capital sensitive). Btw, you can also already add Bridge.vETH.\nFollow the steps and the currency will be added to your main screen.\nPreconverting to Bridge.vETH\nVerus Desktop\nTo actually start preconverting currencies to Bridge.vETH click on \u201cConvert Currencies\u201d.\n\nNow go to \u201cAdvanced\u201d.\n\nYou only need to fill in the highlighted parts of the form. See below:\nAmount: how much of vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH you want to convert to Bridge.vETH\nFrom Currency: Fill in vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH (not case sensitive)\nTo Currency: Fill in Bridge.vETH (not case sensitive)\nDestination Address: Fill in where you want to receive the Bridge.vETH (on Fri 20 Oct). Can be a R-address, i-address or VerusID.\nSend as pre-convert: Check this\nRefund Address: Sometimes a currency has a minimum or maximum amount to preconvert before it launches. For example, when the minimum preconversion amount is not met, and thus the currency not launched, you will receive your funds back. In this case there isn\u2019t a minimum or maximum but you still need to fill it in. Can be the same as your Destination Address.\nNow click on \u201cConvert Currencies\u201d and confirm the transaction. You have now preconverted funds into Bridge.vETH!\nVerus Mobile\nNow we want to preconvert currencies (vETH, DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH) into Bridge.vETH.\n\nClick on the currency you want to preconvert into Bridge.vETH. Go to the correct tab where you have the currency stored. Click \u201cSend\u201d, then \u201cConvert or Cross-chain\u201d, then click \u201cPre-convert\u201d.\nRecipient address: This is the address where you will receive the Bridge.vETH, you can click on \u201cself\u201d, or choose something else.\nAmount: choose the amount of the currency you want to convert into Bridge.vETH.\nCurrency to convert to: Fill in Bridge.vETH (not case sensitive)\nThen click send and follow the steps. You have now preconverted currencies into Bridge.vETH!\nOn Friday 20 Oct you will receive an amount of the 100,000 initial supply of Bridge.vETH in your destination address.\nYou can always check verus.io/eth-bridge for statistics on Bridge.vETH\nJoin the community.

It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage for funds in the digital world. Version 0.9.0 also enables Verus Vault on mainnet, the world\u2019s first solution to truly securing your blockchain funds. Use Vault to lock funds for security, vesting, trusts, inheritance, and more.\n\n\u23f0 VerusID (NFT) Marketplace and Verus Vault activate on block 1,796,400 (expected on Monday, 29 November 2021). Update your wallets to v0.9.0 before the activation blockheight to ensure smooth staking, mining, and general operation.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Use VerusID (NFT) Marketplace to exchange VerusIDs publicly and privately.\n\ud83d\udd12 Use Verus Vault to lock funds for security, vesting, trusts, inheritance, and more.\n\ud83c\udfc6 A Marketplace for Anything\nVerusIDs are much more than a typical digital identity. And once you own one on the Verus blockchain or a compatible PBaaS blockchain, it\u2019s yours forever, rent-free, fully under your control. Until the moment you decide to pass it on.\nVerusIDs can be anything you want. They can be bound digitally to many things. They can be bound to you, or other VerusIDs they have authority or ownership of. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private. Including provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the VerusID itself.\nEach VerusID on the Verus blockchain can even be used with Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS \u2014 currently on testnet) to launch a token or DeFi currency, and even an interoperable blockchain. These blockchains inherit all features as they are on the Verus blockchain.\nVerusIDs can hold funds. They can be personal profiles, corporate websites, or government portals. VerusIDs are much more than identities or today\u2019s NFTs. They are owned assets of all kinds on the Verus blockchain. And now those assets can be exchanged easily.\nWith the VerusID Marketplace protocol, anyone is able to buy and sell VerusIDs. You can look for offers on any VerusID (buy or sell offers). If you like the best offer on your VerusID, or if someone likes an offer you made on theirs, the deal is made 100% peer-to-peer, decentralized on the blockchain, without any middleman or contract controller.\nFor total payment privacy, you can even pay or receive payment using private addresses and zero knowledge transactions based on the Zcash Sapling protocol.\nExchanging in Private\nIn addition to advertising worldwide on the blockchain to buy or sell VerusIDs, you can also make an exchange with the Marketplace without ever posting the offer on the blockchain until it is agreed and signed by all parties. Combine that with zero knowledge transactions, and it\u2019s a great way to transact worldwide, escrow-free in private.\nA powerful use case example: A business sells subscriptions for exclusive content. They make VerusIDs with contracts that give access to the exclusive content. They now create a transaction that would pay for the VerusID. They give the transaction to the buyer who then executes it. The buyer now owns the VerusID that gives access to the exclusive content.\nNow imagine how you can do this for a VerusID that can be any kind of asset. A new way for everyone to engage in peer-to-peer, escrow-free commerce has arrived.\nFive New APIs\nVerusID Marketplace introduces five new RPC APIs and CLI commands for this major upgrade: makeoffer, takeoffer, getoffers, closeoffers and listopenoffers.\nmakeoffer: define what you offer and for what. What you offer can be funds, VerusIDs, or when PBaaS goes live even other currencies. What you want in return can also be funds, VerusIDs or currencies. In exchange for what you offer, you also define what VerusID or how much you want for it and in what currency.\ntakeoffer: take a specific offer in exchange for its request.\ngetoffers: specify which VerusID or currency you want to see offers for or on offer, and it returns all offers (buy and sell) in all currencies, sorted by highest to lowest price.\ncloseoffers: close expired or unexpired offers which you opened with makeoffer.\nlistopenoffers: list all offers that you have opened with makeoffer.\n\ud83d\udd12 Protect Your Funds with Verus Vault\nThe new mainnet upgrade enables a completely new level of security and safety for all your funds. Verus Vault allows you to lock any VerusID under your control, while still using its funds to actively stake and earn on the network.\nWhen you lock a VerusID, its funds can not be spent anymore. All locking and unlocking are visible on the blockchain.\nTwo Lock Mechanisms\nYou can lock a VerusID in two different ways that cannot be circumvented by anyone, except the revocation and recovery authorities together.\nLocked and unlocked until number of blocks passed: funds can not be spent until a predetermined number of blocks have passed.\nLocked and unlocked with a delay: funds can not be spent until an unlock has been requested + a predetermined number of blocks have passed\nPowerful Use Cases\nSafe staking: put funds to stake with on a VerusID. Use Vault to lock the identity with a delay of 10,080 blocks ( ~1 week). Now whenever someone gains access to the private keys of the locked VerusID, they have to unlock the identity in order to spend the funds. When someone makes an unlock request that isn\u2019t you, you are warned. The intruder has to wait 10,080 blocks before he can spend the funds. If you have set up revocation and recovery authorities, you now have one week to safeguard your funds away from prying hands, back into your control.\nTrusts: setting up a trust fund for your children. Give your child a time locked VerusID with funds on them. When he or she turns 18, the VerusID unlocks and the funds can be spent. Keep revocation and recovery authorities with yourself or a trustee.\nVesting period: when doing a currency or chain launch, development funds can be diverted to a locked VerusID. After two years the VerusID unlocks and the funds can only be spent with signatures of other developers. You can also spread the funds across multiple identities with different unlock periods.\nThese are just a few examples on how the powerful Verus Vault can be used. VerusID can store any asset on the Verus network, including those bridged from other blockchains. When PBaaS is on mainnet, the first bridged asset is Ethereum.\n\u23f0 VerusID (NFT) Marketplace and Verus Vault activate on block 1,796,400 (expected on Monday, 29 November 2021). Update your wallets to v0.9.0 before the activation blockheight to ensure smooth staking, mining, and general operation.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Use VerusID (NFT) Marketplace to exchange VerusIDs publicly and privately.\n\ud83d\udd12 Use Verus Vault to lock funds for security, vesting, trusts, inheritance, and more.\n\ud83d\udd25 Visit verus.io for more information on Verus\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: VerusCoin Successfully Activates Sapling with New Improvements to Verus Wallet, Electrum Server\u2026\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/veruscoin-successfully-activates-sapling-with-new-improvements-to-verus-wallet-electrum-server-35b44d8bad5c\nContent:\n\nVerusCoin Successfully Activates Sapling with New Improvements to Verus Wallet, Electrum Server and Pool Software\nLatest Developments: Verus Wallet v0.4.0c and later with Stake Guard (NoS Solution) and Other Improved Features; Verus Electrum Server with Sapling Support; Sapling Compatible Pool Software\n\nThe Sapling upgrade has activated on VerusCoin blockchain at blockheight 227520 and the latest innovations, improvements and features are now active for all users running Verus Wallet v0.4.0c and newer.

As of Verus v0.4.0c the Stake Guard CC has activated and can now earn users extra Verus coins by catching cheaters.\nThe Stake Guard technology built into Verus Wallet actively identifies staking wallets which are claiming duplicate blocks on more than one version of the blockchain, using the same staked coins. Once a cheater is identified, the mining or staking wallet which found the cheater is able to spend any actual single reward the cheating wallet won from the main chain.\nWith the new Verus-enhanced features of Sapling and Stake Guard activated as of block height 227520, any miner or staker can enable Stake Guard (see below for instructions) and their node (native wallet) will begin \u201chunting for\u201d and catching any cheaters found.\nUsers assign a new Sapling zs-address as their \u201ccheatcatcher\u201d address for collecting the coinbases from any found cheated blocks. Only the single coinbase that generated on the main chain (not the forks) of a given cheated stake block height are able to be claimed by a cheat catcher. No new coins are minted and no double spending occurs from any forked chain either by the cheater or the miner who caught the cheater.\nOnce you\u2019ve set your Stake Guard zs-address, your full \u201cNative Mode\u201d wallet which is either mining or staking will also be hunting down any instances where the same winning coins are being used across different forks and with the same private key. If your wallet finds such a fork, your wallet will hold the cryptographic proof and spend the single real stake reward from the main chain of that block height. This is done automagically by your wallet at the time of that cheater\u2019s stake reward becoming mature and by utilizing the Stake Guard CC\u2019s condition, to allow a proven cheat spend to spend the coinbase in question.\nAny miner or staker who sets the \u201ccheatcatcher\u201d zs-address parameter may find an additional shielded coinbase in their cheat catching address! Again, this is not new coins being created, it\u2019s literally spending the cheaters single \u201clegitimate\u201d coinbase from the block height at which they cheated, sending it to your zs-address before they can spend it.\nMiners and stakers may also earn a cheat reward from Stake Guard when they don\u2019t earn a normal block reward as it is an equally fair functionality (when enabled) across the entire network of miners and stakers, not weighted by staking or mining power, rather dependent on which wallet \u201csees\u201d the identifiable cheated fork.\nBeyond setting your wallet up to catch cheaters, another important implication of this advancement is to also ensure you are not inadvertently cheating. If you stake on the same wallet across multiple computers, you will most likely lose your staked rewards. You should only stake from one wallet per computer at any time. While you can open the same wallet on two computers, make sure only one of those is staking and the other is not to avoid losing your coinbase rewards!\nHow to Enable Stake Guard:\nEnabling Stake Guard is simple. Following are steps for both CLI and GUI.\nFor CLI Wallet:\nFirst generate a new Sapling-type zs-address with command: \n ./verus-cli/verus z_getnewaddress sapling which will echo back your new zs-address.\nStart your Verus daemon with the parameter -cheatcatcher=zsaddr where \u201czsaddr\u201d is your new zs-address.\nFor example, to start the daemon staking and with Stake Guard enabled, you would run: ./verus-cli/verusd -mint -cheatcatcher=zsaddr\nFor GUI Wallet:\nFirst generate a new Sapling-type zs-address from the Send section by choosing \u201cPrivate Address (Sapling)\u201d from the Get New Address drop down:\n\nNext, copy that new address by clicking the 3 vertical dots on the left of the new \u201czs\u201d address in your list, and clicking \u201cCopy Pub Key\u201d\n\nNavigate to the Settings (top right menu) and expand \u201cApp Config (config.json)\u201d, then scroll down and paste your zs-address into the field labeled \u201cYour VRSC sapling address for receiving funds cheaters attempt to steal\u201d\n\nLastly, save your settings by scrolling down and clicking \u201cSave app config\u201d. For good measure, close Verus Agama, wait for it to shutdown completely, then open again.\n\nLite Mode Sapling Transactions\nThe Verus v0.4.0f GUI wallet has new support coded in for Sapling-compatible Lite Mode transactions. With the new developments to the Verus Electrum server, enabling Sapling support, users are able to perform the new zs-address lightning-fast shielding transactions within the lite wallet! This support is for both VerusCoin and Zcash networks when using the \u201cd\u201d version of the Verus GUI wallet.\nImproved Multi-Coin Support\nAnother important improvement Verus made in this version of the wallet is better support for multiple coins. Verus wallet supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, Zcash (with Sapling enabled), and Dash by default along with most of the Komodo ecosystem coins.\nVerus is also working to include Pirate (ARRR) in a future release and will continue to keep the wallet on the cutting edge as a multi-coin wallet.\nAdditional Fixes and Improvements\nThis edition of the Verus wallet also fixes a few other issues and improvements, including:\nFixed: Some non-Latin usernames cause failure to load\nFixed: Wallet balance can get out of sync with blockchain when staking\nTo fix any out-of-sync issues, perform a Rescan by doing the following:\nFor CLI\nAdd the parameter -rescan when starting the daemon\nFor GUI\nWhen starting the GUI click \u201cActivate Coin\u201d, not the dropdown shortcut\nChoose \u201cVerus\u201d from the modal and select \u201cNative mode\u201d\nSelect the \u201cdaemon param: rescan\u201d option\nClick \u201cActivate Coin\u201d\nFurther Important Developments by Verus\nIn addition to this important and ground-breaking update to the Wallet, Verus completed two very important developments in support of the newly improved blockchain upgrade: Electrum and Pool Software.\nSapling Enabled Electrum Server\nVerus has enhanced their Electrum Server for Sapling support, making Lite Mode Sapling Z-Transactions possible. Lead developer Mike Toutonghi first noticed that his attempts at finding an Electrum server which would support the new Sapling transactions, were fruitless.\nAs a result, Mike coded the support into the Verus Electrum server, which has been fully tested and seamlessly activated along with the blockchain Sapling activation at VerusCoin block height 227520.\nThe Verus Electrum server is able to be used to successfully handle Sapling transactions for \u201cLite Mode\u201d of Verus and Zcash from the latest Verus v0.4.0f wallet update. This support has been tested and is deployed on Verus\u2019 Electrum Server for use with all lite mode transactions.\nSapling Enabled Pool Software\nBeing thorough and excellent are two very important qualities to which Verus holds true. Providing fully Sapling compatible pool software is another example of this commitment to the community and the project.\nVerus has coded Sapling support into the Pool Software. This software can be used by any Zcash fork which activates Sapling!\nGet involved in Verus and the Verus community\nVisit https://veruscoin.io\nDiscord https://discord.gg/VRKMP2S\nResources\nHow to Update or Install Verus GUI Enhanced Agama Wallet\nVerus Coin v0.4.0 Official Release Notes\nHow Verus Solved Nothing at Stake and Weak Subjectivity for Proof of Work\nEverything You Need to Know About the Zcash Sapling Upgrade\nBen\u2019s Pocket Guide to VerusCoin for Dummies and Smart People\nKomodo Ecosystem Spotlight: Verus Coin\nKomodo AMA Spotlights VerusCoin\nFormation of The Verus Coin Foundation with a Vision of PBaaS\n\n\n---NEW FILE---\n\nTitle: Announcing Formation of The Verus Coin Foundation with a Vision of Public Blockchains as a Service\u2026\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/announcing-formation-of-the-verus-coin-foundation-with-a-vision-of-public-blockchains-as-a-service-fb5470143fff\nContent:\n\nAnnouncing Formation of The Verus Coin Foundation with a Vision of Public Blockchains as a Service Provisioning and Powering Scalable Autochains and Applications through Staking and Mining\nJuly 30, 2018 \u2014 Announcing the Verus Coin Foundation, endowed with over 4 million Verus Coins \u2014 dedicated to realizing the Verus Vision of Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) powering scalable, autochains and applications through staking and mining, as outlined in the Verus Vision paper and beyond.\nAccording to Michael Toutonghi, lead developer for the Verus Project:\nWe\u2019ve seen the benefits of using blockchain for currency and even decentralized applications bound to a single blockchain.

Be ready to maximize profit with your hardware. Mine up to 22 blockchains with the same hashrate. With Verus\u2019 hardware equalizing hashing algorithm (VerusHash 2.2) you can mine efficiently with CPUs, mobile phones and even ARM devices.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 UPDATE 21 MARCH 2024: The first ever PBaaS-chain is being launched on April 1 2024 (not a joke). From then on miners can mine 2 chains simultaneously with the same hashrate!\nMore on the first ever PBaaS-chain launch: piratechain.com/v-arrr\nEfficient Mining\nVerusHash 2.2 is created to level the playing field for all hardware. The hashing algorithm uses the AES/AVX instruction sets built into most modern CPUs to boost CPU hash power.\nMine Verus most efficiently with CPUs, mobile phones and even certain ARM devices. Compare mining hashrates here.\nCoinbase Rewards\n1440 blocks are generated each day. On average 720 blocks go to miners, 720 blocks go to stakers (learn more on staking Verus). For generating \u2014 or finding \u2014 a block, miners and stakers get compensated. This compensation is called a coinbase reward. There will never be more than 83,540,184 VRSC.\nIf you look at the image below, you might think that the possibility of earning VRSC for miners and stakers goes down drastically. We explain next that earnings don\u2019t stop at coinbase rewards.\nVerus Coin Emission Schedule. From block height 10,080 on, all coinbase rewards of 384 and 192 VRSC were timelocked and then unlocked at random block heights. The last of those rewards were unlocked at block height 1,181,520.\nEarning from Economic Activity\nMiners and stakers don\u2019t just earn coinbase rewards (the reward for finding a new block), they also take a small portion of the Fee Pool. The Fee Pool collects fees that are paid by users when they are interacting with the protocol. Protocol fees include:\nPBaaS-chain: creating a blockchain on Verus costs 10,000 VRSC. 5,000 VRSC goes into the Verus Fee Pool, and 5,000 VRSC goes into the Fee Pool of the created blockchain, earned by miners and stakers of that blockchain\n(DeFi) Currency and tokens: creating a currency on the Verus blockchain costs 200 VRSC\nVerusID: identity fees for miners and stakers are 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100 VRSC\nsubID: under launched currencies and tokens subIDs can be created, these cost 0.02 VRSC\nConversion fees: each time a user converts currencies it costs 0.025% or 0.05% \u2014 miners and stakers get 50% of these fees\nTransaction fees: each transaction is minimally 0.0001 VRSC\nMiners and stakers are protecting the blockchain and at the same time servicing the Verus economy. We expect the Fee Pool rewards to exceed the coinbase rewards.\nThink about it: someone creates a PBaaS-chain, 5,000 VRSC goes to the Fee Pool, the winner of the next block gets 50 VRSC extra on top of the coinbase reward. Now imagine a whole lot of economic activity: users making conversions through the protocol, registering VerusIDs, creating DeFi currencies and tokens, and the Fee Pool can get quite large.\nVerus Fee Pool. Percentage is subject to change before hitting mainnet.\nMerge-Mine up to 22 Chains\nThe example above is only for mining Verus directly. Keep in mind that Verus is a multichain protocol. All PBaaS-chains in the protocol have exactly the same specifications as the Verus mainchain. They too have a Fee Pool that collects fees through VerusID registrations, conversions, DeFi currency and tokens and even in a later stage also PBaaS-chains!\nAnd you can mine 22 of them! All with the same hashrate as you would when mining only Verus.\nAll these chains have the same consensus algorithm, 50% PoW, 50% PoS, so you can also stake an unlimited amount of PBaaS-chains.\nMerge-mine 22 chains with one device\nHappy Mining (and Staking)!\nEveryone in the world can start mining Verus today with our low barrier hashing algorithm.

To launch, or materialize a token, an account abstraction, or any other form of currency or identity-like structure (NFTs, liquidity pools, etc), you write an executable program/contract, according to accepted conventions, but with no actual checks that you follow any form of math accuracy, interface adherence, or accounting rules whatsoever.\nThe differentiation of these contracts, which are akin to stored procedures in a database, but carry with them the DB schema as well as the interface, is in the way they enable differences of implementation of those accepted conventions.\nConsensus across all of Ethereum is applied to ensuring that the shared, serialized, worldwide computer that is the EVM executes its low level instructions accurately, with no accounting of currencies, exchanges, enablement of efficient, actual IDs, zk-privacy, etc. The currencies that run above the single native security currency, run by arbitrary rules, often opaque or containing unexpected behaviors, and everyone must create their version of these contracts to build a dApp.\nVerus Smart Transactions\nIn Verus, it\u2019s a new model as follows:\nYour dApp can run on a client or on a broad range of resource types, and it communicates via the same RPC API as the CLI commands (optionally without wallet or control functions) with a fully functional, decentralized backend, which is the Internet of Value, including all its unlimited scale, connected systems and chains.\nUnlike a single currency blockchain, Verus smart transactions natively support an unlimited number of friendly name currencies directly via protocol and an unlimited number of blockchains for currency launches, simple sends, currency conversions, or cross-chain operations. All inputs, outputs, cross-chain imports, and even conversions are validated and in/out values of all currencies accounted for by consensus, just as native currency ins and outs are on single-currency blockchains.\nIdentities are a first class concept in the primitives available for dApps. They all support fully available, open, decentralized, user controlled authentication and authorization protocols, enabled by QR code or deep links and supportive of permission granting, ID provisioning/sale by the dApp, private/attested KYC and other services. These protocols can easily be bridged to OAuth or OpenID Connect via servers like Hydra, but used natively, they require no service provider between the service actually authenticating the user and the user themselves.\nEvery identity is multisig and has revocation and recovery capabilities. They are also transferable and can have rights bound into them in a provable manner via the contentmultimap. All of this is supported as primitives in the core RPC/CLI api/command line and in the core protocol.\nIDs enable their holders to launch like-named currencies, blockchains, and single NFT-like tokens that have a super power over the ID, which is very useful for an ID that may live across multiple chains.\nIDs and currencies may be created and launched on one chain, leveraging all of that chains capabilities (Verus includes many variations in currency, including conditional crowdfunding, liquidity pools, blockchains, etc.), and exported to other chains to be used everywhere across the network. For example, if you launch a currency on Verus or any PBaaS chain, including the native PBaaS chain\u2019s currency. All of those currency definitions can be exported to Ethereum, and they will emerge on Ethereum as an automatically created and functional ERC20 contract, enabling the currency to be sent back and forth via protocol from then on.\nAll identities and currencies are resolvable worldwide, meaning that you can determine a network path to the nodes of the blockchain where they were defined via their friendly name, or usually via their i-address, if they have been exported cross-chain. This enables apps to scale over any number of decentralized blockchains worldwide and leave the management of user databases and user data, as well as settings, signals, endpoints, etc. to the users themselves and the client apps they use to help them manage.\nBecause the currency and liquidity pool support is in the L1 protocol, we have been able to actually solve for and provide MEV-resistant (both intra and inter-block) AMMs as a primitive, available to all applications and users.\nPeople don\u2019t have to write basic liquidity and conversion protocols, which are just primitives, not apps. Real apps can use all of these primitives to deliver the next level of function. Payments, currency conversions, earning systems, polls, voting, multi-chain world scale social networks using provable streams in provable IDs, crowdfunding, independent economies. All primitives, such as IDs, currencies, blockchains, and liquidity baskets have very rich capabilities from launch to continued operation.\nExtending Verus Smart Transactions\nIf someone wants to extend smart transactions, that is an option, but they either don\u2019t have to, or if they really have a reason to do so, they can do it on their PBaaS chain, share or not share back (lots of reasons to do so), and now that we have the core primitive framework as a foundation, we can certainly collaborate on a kind of protocol extension that is likely to include forms of VM and/or ZKVM extension points in the current protocol, to work within the framework of the core primitives that are fundamental to Verus and that we believe are crucial for safe financial infrastructure, yet generally missing in other systems.\nTry Yourself! \u2705\nLook up docs.verus.io to use many API commands (e.g. launching currencies, tokens & liquidity pools).\nOr look up the complete command list here.\nJoin the community.

The result is a series of improvements including lower costs, optimization of liquidity, and new benefits to users.\n\nThe power of automated market makers and liquidity pools is a recently growing phenomenon, which so far has only been explored primarily within the VM models of Ethereum/EOS/Tron.\nThe VM model is based on serial processing of ordered transactions, solving each transaction one after the other after the other, etc..\nVerus is an UTXO-based blockchain using smart transactions which are essentially smart contracts written into the protocol.\nThe Verus model allows for parallel processing of all transactions within a block simultaneously, allowing new paradigms for community driven liquidity.\nParallel processing saves users costs by reducing slippage, eliminating front-running, eliminating risks from faulty smart contracts and unintended consequences.\nParallel processing also allows for the fairest prices without mind to latency or gas price rigging, as well as novel investment vehicles, new approaches to arbitrage, and better use of all existing liquidity in a system.\nVerus DeFi is conducted by smart \u201csend transactions\u201d on Verus blockchains any of which may include multi-chain capabilities; this means chain transaction costs are kept as low as possible or new, less expensive chains can take the traffic, and scalability is practically unlimited.\nThe Verus community believes that community driven liquidity does not need to be driven entirely by yield farming, but that ample liquidity will emerge under low-cost conditions, and that this liquidity will provide the lowest friction, lowest cost, lowest risk, fairest conversion transactions for the crypto and wider financial communities.\nVerus is concurrently in the advanced stages of completing decentralized bridging technology which will allow other blockchain ecosystems (including Ethereum and its ERC-20s) to be represented on the Verus system in a decentralized manner.\nAutomated Market Makers and Community Driven Liquidity\nThe era of smart contract enabled blockchains, pioneered by Ethereum, has allowed the creation of new financial primitives. Among the most important of these are automated market makers. Brought to the Ethereum blockchain in 2017, they have developed into a popular new paradigm for conversion of one financial instrument to another. By attracting ERC20 holders to lock their tokens in so-called liquidity pools, the reserves in these pools act as an always-ready counterparty able to transact with any user at an algorithmically determined price. Prior to this, all price discovery in crypto markets had been through the bid/ask, order-matching paradigm. Automated market makers replace the order book with on-chain reserves, allowing asynchronous price discovery. The recently surging use of Ethereum-based liquidity pools speaks to the power of the model.\nNotwithstanding the success so far, there have been various drawbacks and concerns with the community liquidity solutions that have been employed. The highest profile problems have been cases where the smart contracts involved have errors in design or execution that were overlooked, leading to catastrophic loss for liquidity providers. But other large problems have emerged, including front-running, latency wars, gas price rigging and high transaction costs. Less noticed drawbacks include sub-optimal use of all available liquidity in a system, and sub-optimal slippage on price discovery.\nThe Smart Contract VM Model\nPrior to Komodo and Verus, smart contract enabled blockchains have used the state machine VM model where the blockchain acts as one giant world computer on which various contracts are \u201crun\u201d. This has been realized as a system of ordered actions/transactions simulating discrete events on a timeline, executed serially, in order, which is controlled by the miner. For liquidity pools and their users, this means that, within a block, one transaction or another will be the first to be processed (usually determined by order, and selected from all possible transactions by latency or gas prices paid), while others follow, in order. In serial processing, the order of the sequenced transactions has important implications for the fair and efficient use of liquidity.\nFront-running is traditionally viewed as predatory market behavior and is endemic on Ethereum-based systems where transactions and contracts submitted to the network are public, and queue-jumping can take place. As described in the well-known 2019 paper Flash Boys 2.0 there is inevitably a race to be the \u201cnext trade\u201d, and the entire platform becomes dominated by a zero sum game to optimally position a transaction in the sequence, with advantage to the miners, who often defer, based on earnings opportunity, to the most sophisticated and well-financed players .\nLatency wars and gas price rigging are just two ways of manipulating the transaction sequence, a zero-sum arbitrage exploit. Advantage can be gained by reducing latency through better infrastructure; for example, by being in a better position in the network topology. Advantage also goes to traders/arbs who have worked out better gas price strategies, or have made deals with key miners. As described in Flash Boys 2.0, as the DeFi worlds grow bigger on Ethereum, systemic risks to the network consensus may arise when time-bandit attacks and additional exploits start to look enticing.\nHigh transaction costs \u2014 for users who seek to convert from one asset to another, transaction costs are many and growing, starting with the basic Ethereum gas prices, which are large and growing on the crowded network. Additional costs come from the conversion fees needed to pay the \u201cyield farmers\u201d who stock the liquidity pools. And finally, there is the cost from predatory activity as described above. There are also unseen costs that arise from the less efficient design of serial transaction processing. Parallel transaction processing (described below) allows for more optimal slippage rates and more efficient use of overall systemic liquidity.\n\nVerus \u2014 Smart Transactions\nVerus is an entirely different model for the execution of smart transactions on the blockchain. In Verus. smart contract capabilities are primitives built into the protocol on a UTXO-based blockchain and are accessed by users through smart transactions. There are no intervening smart contracts to audit or sweat over. There is only the single protocol that leverages the added security gained from using a UTXO-based system. Users interact with smart contracts by issuing transactions using a simple command line API, or a few clicks in the GUI wallet. Most importantly for liquidity pools, protocol based smart transactions allow for the simultaneous solving of submitted transactions in any group of transactions, which for native currencies can either be a specific block, for launches, all pre-launch blocks, or for normal conversions, a group of transactions aggregated by the protocol rules. By processing all transactions aggregated according to the protocol in parallel, as opposed to serial processing, the specific order within a block has no impact on the fairness of any conversion. In fact, all conversions in all directions, which are processed on one group of transactions get exactly the same conversion price, without even a spread between conversions to and from a specific currency. The implications of this fundamental design difference are many and important.\nThere is also a fundamental difference in how Verus developers have chosen to implement liquidity pools and token conversions. In Ethereum, the users (converters of tokens) interact with different smart contracts than do the liquidity providers. They operate on different sides of the playing field, so to speak, only meeting occasionally to transact. In Verus, however, users and providers are using the exact same mechanism to achieve their ends \u2014 they each issue the same transactions, converting to, from or through an asset known as a multi-reserve currency. This new asset is, in effect, the pool. When a user wishes to convert from one token to another, they can conduct two successive transactions, first entering the \u201cpool\u201d by acquiring the multi-reserve currency, then, in the subsequent block, exiting the \u201cpool\u201d to the target currency. Or, they can elect to convert directly from reserve to reserve using a single \u201cvia\u201d transaction, through the \u201cpool\u201d. These conversion transactions are accomplished by simple \u201csending\u201d transactions, as easily as one would typically send a single cryptocurrency. Prices do not need to be selected as the user will be able to observe the price from the last block, understand the typical changes from block to block, and transact at the \u201cmarket\u201d price. The market price is the same fair, solved price for all users who transact in a block.\nReduced Costs and Risks for Liquidity Providers\nThe Verus system drives the marginal cost for provision of liquidity to zero, with the exception of the phenomenon known as \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d. There are no smart contracts to audit \u2014 no unintended scenarios for poorly written contracts that will lead to catastrophic loss. Impermanent loss is dealt with through a fee of 0.025% that is paid to the \u201cpool\u201d holders by every conversion that goes directly from \u201creserve\u201d to \u201creserve\u201d. The phenomenon of impermanent loss is a mathematical property of automated market makers, inherent to the mechanisms required to solve new prices as reserves change from block to block. Unattended, it operates to penalize liquidity providers in situations where the conversion ratios of constituent currencies in a multi-reserve pool have diverged from the ratios that prevailed when the provider entered the pool. In the Ethereum VM model, as in Verus, the method to counteract impermanent loss includes the imposition of a standard conversion transaction fee. In Verus, the fee is earned and shared by holders of the multi-reserve currency, thus offering a yield based on the amount of the reserve-to-reserve conversion transactions conducted. In Verus, the fee is currently set at 0.025%, which is significantly lower than similar fees in Ethereum. The Verus community believes this will be more than sufficient to counteract impermanent loss in all but the most extreme cases.\nReduced Costs for Users/Converters\nAs stated multiple times above, the Verus system eliminates common predatory front-running behaviors. This is an endemic problem in Ethereum-based systems, and also in traditional financial markets, where high frequency trading and \u201cflash boys\u201d operate to game value out of the system at the expense of less sophisticated players. In traditional markets, where ordered transactions and serial transaction processing are also a necessary part of the paradigm, exchanges have begun to experiment with \u201cspeed bumps\u201d in order to reduce the advantages of players with more sophisticated infrastructure and superior latency. With the decentralized, parallel transaction processing engine used by Verus nobody can predict the exact timing of the solving block, all transactions included in a block get the same price in all directions, and no single party can reliably control what transactions are or are not processed. Thus, Verus eliminates intra-block frontrunning, and using transaction expiration, even sophisticated front-runners that may attempt multi-block mining control can be prevented entirely using \u201cfill-or-kill\u201d transactions.\nThe parallel processing system also leads to reduced slippage for users in almost all circumstances. In all automated market makers, the price offered changes due to interaction with the system. Put simply, if I sell ETH for ERC20, my interaction will push down the price of ETH, and I will get less ERC20 than is indicated by the price existing immediately before my transaction. The larger the size of my transaction, the more slippage I will see. In a system that solves all transactions in parallel, including all \u201cbuys\u201d and all \u201csells\u201d, slippage is reduced because in solving the price for a block, the protocol will first \u201ccancel out\u201d (in the mathematical sense) all the buys and sells until one of them is zero. Then, in the above example, if purchases of ETH exceed sales of ETH (in the block in which I transact), then the price, from my perspective will have improved from that existing immediately prior to my transaction \u2014 the direct opposite of slippage. In a robustly-used system, it should be true that overall slippage experienced by users will be significantly lower than in a serial-based system.\nImproved Benefits for Users\nA significant benefit, covered extensively already, is that users (converters) can expect to receive the fairest, best price without any needed sophistication, trading algorithms, bots, superior infrastructure investment, and the like. In a \u201cpool\u201d that is fairly large (compared to my trading size) and regularly transacted, I can simply issue a sendcurrency command, and transact at market, with a calm and confidence that is rare in other serial-based heavily-gamed markets.\nIn fact, because of parallel processing, and the fact that other traders can be entering the pool along with me during my block, system stability acts as if overall liquidity has been significantly amplified (relative to what is possible with serial processing). In other words, for a given level of liquidity in the pool, a user can expect more stable slippage rates from block to block. There are two primary reasons for this. Firstly, with all transactions in a block cancelling themselves out towards parity, there is a lower ratio of effective aggregate transaction size to aggregate liquidity, thus giving the appearance of greater liquidity. Secondly, because other users (converters) are in the block with me, system liquidity is enhanced by use, even if users intend only to use the multi-reserve currency as a point-to-point conversion, and not a destination in itself. In this way, liquidity begets liquidity \u2014 if a particular multi-reserve is bootstrapped with sufficient liquidity, it becomes attractive for users because they can convert in the fair, low slippage, ungamed, low cost environment. As users come, liquidity naturally increases, and the system becomes increasingly robust, thus attracting more users.\nHaving said this, the multi-reserves also serve as a liquidity destination in themselves. This is because the multi-reserves act as two different types of novel investment vehicles. First, they are a self-rebalancing portfolio with zero fees and dynamic rebalancing over 1000 times per day. An investor can, for example, choose to convert into a \u201cquad coin\u201d that is a multi-reserve currency that is backed by 25/25/25/25% of four different tokens (say, ETH, BTC, VRSC, USDT). Many sophisticated investors typically follow efficient portfolio theory and engage in occasional rebalancing. Usually done once a year, a quarter, or after sharp moves, rebalancing requires management oversight (thus costs or fees) and continuous transaction fees for selling and acquiring the coins (plus occasional market slippage in that process). It can also only vaguely approximate the desired hoped for strategy. In a multi-reserve, exposure is retained at 25/25/25/25 automatically, without fees, and is done on every block \u2014 a significant advance for all who seek to stay with balanced exposure despite market moves.\nIt\u2019s important to note, as described above, that a self-rebalancing portfolio would be susceptible to impermanent loss. Accordingly, in order to counteract this, and to attract providers who are interested in self-rebalancing, Verus includes the already described conversion fees. At a minimum, these fees should be sufficient to counteract any impermanent loss. Also possible though, is the result that the conversion fees will exceed the impermanent loss experienced by a provider \u2014 this is because impermanent loss is not \u201cpermanent\u201d in the sense that it appears and disappears only insofar as conversion ratios diverge from those that prevailed when a provider acquired the multi-reserve currency. So, in the example of highly used conversion \u201cpools\u201d where those rates eventually return to those prevailing when the provider entered the system, there would be no impermanent loss but the provider would still enjoy conversion fees that were generated along the way. Such situations give liquidity providers the opportunity to \u201cyield farm\u201d.\nA second \u201cdestination\u201d for investors is that they can achieve \u201cthrottled exposure\u201d to an asset. Throttled exposure is the opposite of leverage and can be used to reduce risk, or to mirror, for example, the strategy of constantly selling down an appreciating asset, or constantly \u201cdollar cost averaging down\u201d with a falling asset. This throttling, or averaging up and down is also done automatically, with no fees, on every block more than a thousand times a day.\nFinally, while liquidity baskets and balanced investments across multiple currencies is one way to use the Verus DeFi protocols, fractional currencies do not need to be 100% backed. While beyond the scope of this article, currencies that are not 100% backed have market prices that are decoupled from their underlying reserve basket, providing seamless liquidity to and from its basket currencies, earning fees between them, yet providing investment value that may far exceed a function of the currencies held in reserve as well.\nEase of Use, Low Transactions Costs and Scalability\nVerus DeFi is conducted by normal \u201csend transactions\u201d using its sendcurrency API (or the GUI in the wallet). To convert from one currency into another, a user simply sends to themselves, electing to convert from a particular token to another token via a multi-reserve currency that contains both tokens as reserves. There are no limit orders currently implemented in Verus, as it is expected that robust pairs will have low slippage and fair, market rates. In less robust multi-reserves, users will have to take care that they do not transact in excessive volumes in order to guard against prices moving sharply in an undesired direction.\nVerus is also in the process of implementing multi-chain capabilities with independent blockchains that are interoperable such that a particular token can exist on more than one chain. When work on a new chain requires a transaction fee, it can be paid in either an existing or new token, as appropriate. This leads to practically unlimited scalability since multi-reserves and tokens that are \u201cpopular\u201d do not lead to chain congestion or transaction fee competition. Accordingly, transaction fees will always remain at a de minimis level.\nEase of use also operates at the level of liquidity \u201cpool creation\u201d, making pool creation possible for all types of users. No programming is required to define a pool. A user simply uses the definecurrency api (or a few clicks on the wallet GUI) to launch a new multi-reserve currency. It is a risk-less, permission-less process. Coupled with Verus\u2019 multi-chain capabilities and easy creation of independent blockchains, new currencies, tokens and projects can set up community liquidity, and bootstrap it to a level commensurate to their size. This opens the door to all kinds of novel uses and developments.\nUser-Centric DeFi\nThe Verus community believes that community driven liquidity does not need to be driven entirely by yield farming (and increased costs to users), but that ample liquidity will emerge under near-zero-cost conditions, and that this liquidity will provide the lowest friction, lowest cost, lowest risk, fairest conversion transactions for the crypto and wider financial communities. As discussed above, liquidity will come from investors using multi-reserves as novel investment vehicles, from system liquidity (where continuous use begets its own liquidity), and from novel probabilistic arbitrage strategies which may result in staying \u201cinvested\u201d in multi-reserves for multi-block periods. Also, coin communities, whales, and others who wish to bootstrap liquidity can do so more easily than in a VM-based system because they can do it with less risk and cost.\nWhat is Verus\u2019 DeFi Universe?\nVerus is currently in the advanced stages of implementing its decentralized bridging protocols which will allow various coins, both ETH-like and UTXO coins, and others, to be represented on the Verus system in a decentralized manner, and it will also allow all Verus-created currencies to be sent to and represented in the Ethereum network as automatically created ERC20 tokens. This will lead to an expansive universe of potential tokens and coins with liquidity across the Verus system and other leading blockchain networks.\nIn addition, with multi-chain capabilities, Verus will be a go-to destination for new projects and blockchains, as there is an easy, scalable system to deploy, with ready-made cost-free, risk-free roads to liquidity for new communities and projects.\nDiscuss and explore all Verus has to offer on Discord.
