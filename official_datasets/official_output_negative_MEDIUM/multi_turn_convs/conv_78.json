    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been wondering about the creators of Verus. How did they, who were previously involved in building technology for corporations, manage to create a decentralized and secure protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! The creators of Verus did not build the protocol in just a year. The Verus PBaaS protocol was designed, built, and tested over more than 5 years by a self-selected and often volunteer group of technology, finance, legal, operations, or life veterans and newbies alike. They brought their collective expertise and experience to create a protocol that truly prioritizes decentralization and security.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've heard about some huge losses in the crypto space. What's the main reason for the loss of billions of dollars of value in the crypto space?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the main reason for the loss of billions of dollars of value in the crypto space is primarily due to poor design and implementation of cross-chain bridges, bugs in complex smart contract workflows, stolen or compromised private keys, and outright theft by contract controllers. It's a complex issue, but essentially, it boils down to a lack of security and decentralization in many crypto projects.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really concerning. I've heard some rumors about Verus, and I want to clarify something. Is Verus a protocol that was created by VCs and centralized exits to further exploit naive early users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, definitely not! Verus was not created by VCs and centralized exits to further exploit naive early users. Verus was founded by technology veterans and others who believe humanity can do better than being exploited by the technology they had been building for corporations over decades. The Verus PBaaS protocol was designed to provide a more secure and decentralized solution to the problems plaguing the crypto space. The creators of Verus are genuinely committed to creating a better future for all users, not just exploiting them for profit.",
