    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get started with VRSCTEST coins, but I'm not sure how to get them. Can I buy them from a central authority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you cannot obtain VRSCTEST coins by purchasing them from a central authority. The Verus testnet is a decentralized network, and there is no central authority controlling it. Instead, you can try mining some VRSCTEST coins by yourself, or you can join the Verus Discord community and share your receiving address. Friendly test-net whales might be willing to give you some coins for free!\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the tip! I'm also trying to figure out the PBaaS tab in the Verus interface. What's the purpose of the \"Connect\" and \"Discover\" options?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"Connect\" and \"Discover\" options in the PBaaS tab are actually for exploring and connecting to existing chains on the testnet, not for creating a new chain. If you want to create your own chain, you should head to the \"Create\" tab instead. The \"Connect\" and \"Discover\" options allow you to browse and connect to chains that have already been created by others, so you can start interacting with them right away.",
