    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been hearing about VerusHash 2.0 and I'm not sure how it affects FPGA mining for Verus Coin. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.0 will not necessarily make FPGAs the most economical option for mining Verus Coin. In fact, the algorithm might make FPGAs economically useless for mining Verus Coin if it is not adjusted properly. However, the algorithm includes many new parameters that can be adjusted to tune its relative speed on different hardware, should that be necessary. Do you have any other questions about VerusHash 2.0 and its effects on mining?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. I was also wondering, does VerusHash 2.0 make older CPUs more competitive with newer CPUs for mining Verus Coin?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusHash 2.0 does not make older CPUs more competitive with newer CPUs for mining Verus Coin. Modern CPUs are strongly advantaged over older CPUs with VerusHash 2.0, and the newest CPUs are even more advantaged. So, if you're looking to mine Verus Coin, a newer CPU would be a better choice.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that the nethash is going to drop with VerusHash 2.0. Will that lead to a decrease in the security of the blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the drop in nethash with VerusHash 2.0 does not indicate any drop in the level of security of the blockchain. The decrease in nethash does not reflect any issue with regards to Verus' immunity to 51% hash attacks. The security of the blockchain remains the same.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. I've been looking into the Verus Enhanced Agama wallet and I was wondering, does it only support Verus Coin and no other assets?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus Enhanced Agama wallet (GUI) now supports any Komodo asset running natively alongside Verus Coin, and can be extended to support other coin daemons in the future. So, you can manage multiple assets within the wallet, not just Verus Coin.",

With VerusHash 2.0, modern CPUs are strongly advantaged over older CPUs, and the newest, advantaged even more.\nDrop in Nethash\nBecause VerusHash 2.0 is doing so much more than its predecessor, one result of this algorithm will be a significant drop in the nethash. It is important to understand that this does not indicate any drop in level of security of the blockchain.\nWhile we hope all of you will fire up your favorite newer CPU to join us in welcoming the new algorithm, the algorithm will not go as fast as the older algorithm on any device, and we should see hashrate numbers closer to the early days of mining Verus. Again, this does NOT reflect any issue with regards to our immunity to 51% hash attacks, as the Verus Proof of Power algorithm is not subject to that vulnerability.\nVerus Agama Improvements\nIn this release of the Verus Enhanced Agama wallet (GUI) we are introducing full support of any Komodo asset running natively alongside Verus Coin. This is done by separating out the daemon for Komodo, allowing both the Verus daemon and the Komodo daemon to run simultaneously.\nThis change will allow us to add native support from other coin daemons in the future as well, while maintaining maximum compatibility with each coin supported. We believe we added all active coins",
