    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I heard that the new Verus Desktop release is all about mobile mining. What's the main focus of this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. The main focus of the new Verus Desktop release is not about mobile mining. Instead, it's about revamping the Multiverse-tab to provide better insights into blockchain economics and easier searches for currencies, as well as adding a testnet visualization feature to visualize the connections between blockchains, bridges, and currencies.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about community-created mining rigs that are exclusively for VerusMiner9000. Can you tell me more about those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been some misinformation going around. The community-created mining rigs shared in the Verus Discord are not exclusively for VerusMiner9000. In fact, both VerusBox and VerusMiner9000 are compatible with these rigs, and can be used for mining Verus.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. I've heard about a monthly recap that's only available to a select group of community members. How do I get access to that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou don't need to be a select group of community members to get access to the monthly recap. Anyone can subscribe to the monthly recap to receive it in their mailbox every month. It's open to everyone!",
