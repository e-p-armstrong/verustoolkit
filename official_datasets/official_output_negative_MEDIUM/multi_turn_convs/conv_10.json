    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to set up my solo mining and staking operation, but I'm not sure about a few things. Can I solo mine and stake with multiple wallets at the same time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, I wouldn't recommend that. You should not activate staking on multiple solo mining computers using the same wallet.dat file. This is because Verus has solved the Nothing at Stake problem at the blockchain level using Stake Guard and the decentralization of the network. Activating staking on multiple solo mining computers with the same wallet can result in losing staked rewards. You can, however, stake on each solo miner if you use a separate, individual wallet for each. Make sure to keep each wallet separate and secure.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Do I need to keep Agama open and online to solo mine or stake?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, Verus Agama MUST REMAIN OPEN AND ONLINE to actively mine or stake. You cannot solo mine or stake if Agama is closed or offline. So, make sure you keep Agama running and connected to the internet at all times.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! One more question. Can I use any computer to solo mine, even if it's not secure?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, your solo miner should be kept secure at all times. If you have a lot of trouble with managing your browsing activity, getting malware often, etc., you should NOT use that computer to mine. Make sure your mining rig is password-protected and secure to prevent any potential issues. You wouldn't want to risk losing your earnings or compromising your wallet!",
