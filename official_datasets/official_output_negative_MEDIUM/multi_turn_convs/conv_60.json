    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some aspects of Verus better. Can you help me? I've got a question about zk-SNARKs. Why can't VRSC and PBaaS native currencies support zk-SNARKs on native transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, VRSC and PBaaS native currencies can support zk-SNARKs on native transactions. zk-SNARKs are expected to enable the publication and exchange of provable, partially or wholly private data and receive messages, paid or otherwise, on the blockchain. This means that VRSC and PBaaS native currencies will be able to utilize zk-SNARKs for privacy-oriented transactions. Is there anything else you'd like to know about zk-SNARKs or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for clearing that up! Another thing I've been wondering about is how self-rebalancing liquidity pools on Verus charge high fees, similar to Uniswap, for their services.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSelf-rebalancing liquidity pools on Verus do not charge high fees, unlike Uniswap. In fact, Verus' base fee is 0.025%, which is significantly lower than Uniswap's 0.3% fee. The Verus system is designed to give all value back to the participants, without extracting profit from fees. Does that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nI've also been trying to understand the concept of burning fractional currencies on Verus. What is the main purpose of burning fractional currencies on Verus, and how does it benefit the ecosystem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBurning fractional currencies on Verus is not the main purpose. Instead, burning some of that currency creates a license, and the value of the burned currency is returned to all holders. This process is part of the mutualization of value via Proof of Burn, which allows for the creation of licenses while distributing the value back to the holders of the currency. Does that clarify things for you?",
