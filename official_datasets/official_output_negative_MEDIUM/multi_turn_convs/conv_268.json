    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've downloaded the Verus folder, but I'm not sure what to name it. What is the recommended default folder name for the unzipped Verus folder?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe recommended folder name is not the default name, but rather \"Verus v0.5.x\", where \"x\" is the current version. This helps keep track of which version is being run. It's a good practice to follow this naming convention to avoid any confusion.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I've also been trying out the Agama app, and I'm not sure if I need to create a new wallet every time I launch it. Do I need to create a new wallet every time I launch the Agama app?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you only need to create a new wallet upon the first launch of the Agama app, when prompted to do so. After that, you can reuse your existing wallet. You won't need to create a new one every time you launch the app.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! And one more question about Agama. What is the default mode selected in the Agama app when you launch it for the first time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the default mode is not specified, but you need to select \"VRSC\" from the dropdown under \"Lite (SPV) Mode\" when launching the Agama app for the first time. So, make sure to select that option to get started with the app.",
