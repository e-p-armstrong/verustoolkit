    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've been staking on Verus for a while now, but I'm not getting a steady income from it. Is there something wrong with my setup?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, there's nothing wrong with your setup. Staking on Verus doesn't provide a steady trickle of proceeds. Instead, it's an all-or-nothing approach, where you earn the full block reward plus fees each time you stake a block. The frequency of staking a block is based on the amount of Verus you have staking, and it's all a matter of statistical averages. You may experience lucky periods and dry spells, but over a long period of time, it should even out. Do you have any further questions about staking or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I've been staking on Verus with a small amount of Verus, but I haven't staked a block in months. Is it impossible for me to stake a block with such a small amount?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot at all! While it's true that the frequency of staking a block is based on the amount of Verus you have staking, there's always a chance that you'll stake a block, even with a relatively small amount of Verus. It may take longer, but over a sufficiently long time, there's a good chance you'll stake at some point. Don't lose hope! It's all about statistical probability.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, can I guarantee that I'll stake a block at least once a week if I have a certain amount of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't guarantee that. Staking on Verus is a matter of statistical averages, and the specifics of when you stake and when you don't are matters of utter randomness. While having a larger amount of Verus increases your chances of staking a block, there's no way to guarantee a specific frequency of staking. Don't worry, though, with time, your chances will even out!",
