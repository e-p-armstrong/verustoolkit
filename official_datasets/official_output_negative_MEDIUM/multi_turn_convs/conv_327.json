    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in solo mining with Verus Agama, but I'm not sure if it's possible without a GPU. Is solo mining with Verus Agama only possible with a GPU?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, solo mining with Verus Agama is not only possible with a GPU. In fact, you can solo mine using your CPU, and you can even dual mine with your CPU, splitting your CPU thread power between pool mining and solo mining. If you have a capable CPU and GPU, you can also mine using both simultaneously.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I didn't know you could dual mine with your CPU. Does dual mining with your CPU require a specific ratio of threads assigned to pool mining and solo mining?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, dual mining with your CPU does not require a specific ratio of threads assigned to pool mining and solo mining. You can assign any number of threads to each, for example, you can assign 4 threads to pool mining and 4 threads to solo mining if your CPU has 8 threads.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I'm still a bit hesitant about solo mining, though. Is solo mining with Verus Agama a very complicated process that requires a lot of technical expertise?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, solo mining with Verus Agama is not a complicated process. In fact, it is described as \"extremely simple to get setup and started\". It does take a little more time than setting up pool mining because you're setting up a full node of Verus and syncing up the Verus blockchain, but it is still a relatively straightforward process. With a little patience, you should be able to get started with solo mining in no time!",
