    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how Verus handles cross-chain transactions. Can you explain why importing cross-chain transaction bundles requires permission from a central authority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception! Importing cross-chain transaction bundles is a permissionless operation that anyone, usually a validator, can perform. This is possible because the protocol ensures via cryptographic proof validation that the cross-chain bundles are the exact bundles in the order they were packaged on the source system, and a proof root is established on both systems for the other. So, no central authority is needed to import these bundles. Do you have any further questions about cross-chain transactions or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I was also wondering about notarization options in Verus. Are auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options identical in terms of security considerations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, they're not identical. Auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options have different security considerations. There are security tradeoffs between the two options, which involve a tradeoff between a permissionless model where proof root determination is enhanced, but not dependent upon multisig agreement of notary witnesses, and a model where establishing any cross-network cryptographic proof root requires the honest participation of a majority of the notary witnesses. So, the choice of notarization option depends on the specific use case and security requirements. Do you have any more questions about notarization in Verus?",

As the protocol ensures via cryptographic proof validation that the cross-chain bundles are the exact bundles in the order they were packaged on the source system, importing cross-chain transaction bundles is a permissionless operation that anyone, usually a validator, can perform, which relies on the proof established in relation to a confirmed, notarized proof root.\nDo auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options have different security considerations?\nYes. Proper planning and selection of options and witness ID structure during the launch of a blockchain network or gateway can ensure that security levels meet network demands. There are security tradeoffs between auto-notarization and notary-confirm options, which basically are a tradeoff between a permissionless model where proof root determination is enhanced, but not dependent upon multisig agreement of notary witnesses, auto-notarization vs. a model where establishing any cross-network cryptographic proof root requires the honest participation of a majority of the notary witnesses, which can be represented by revocable and recoverable IDs, allowing for further decentralization, even while requiring participation of a quorum.\nDetermining which option to choose, how many and what notaries to choose, what other safeguards can further enhance security, and then understanding the resulting security profile from each set of choices, is important when launching a blockchain or gateway.
