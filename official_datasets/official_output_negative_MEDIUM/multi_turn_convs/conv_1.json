    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to start mining, but I'm not sure how to do it. I think I need to close the terminal window, right?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, actually, you don't start mining by closing the terminal window. In fact, you need to leave the window open to mine. If you close the window, the mining process will stop.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see! So how do I shut down the script if I need to?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you want to shut down the script, you need to press specific keys depending on your operating system. On Linux and Mac, you can press CTRL + Z. On Windows, you need to press CTRL + C and then Y. This will stop the mining process and allow you to close the terminal window.",

If you want to shut down the script, in Linux and Mac press CTRL + Z while the terminal is in focus.\nOn Windows press CTRL + C and then Y to terminate.Step 4\nLastly, if you want to see the status of your workers (or just single worker if you\u2019re only using one computer to mine), visit the pool mining site where you\u2019ve chosen to mine and find their Worker Stats section. For example, here are two different pools and their Stats sections (LuckPool on the left, Ginasis on the right):",
