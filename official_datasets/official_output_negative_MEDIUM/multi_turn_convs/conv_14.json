    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about converting VRSC and tBTC. Is it possible to convert them with each other without using Pure as an intermediary?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, Pure is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) that enables the conversion of VRSC and tBTC with each other. Without Pure, it's not possible to directly convert VRSC and tBTC. You need to use Pure as the \"Via Currency\" to convert between VRSC and tBTC. Do you have any other questions about converting VRSC and tBTC?\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I'm using Verus Desktop, and I was wondering if I can convert VRSC and tBTC without going to the \"Advanced\" tab?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you need to go to the \"Advanced\" tab on Verus Desktop to convert VRSC and tBTC with each other using Pure as the \"Via Currency\". The conversion feature is only available in the \"Advanced\" tab. Do you have any other questions about using Verus Desktop?\n\n**User:**\nI see. I also use Verus Mobile, and I was wondering if it's possible to convert VRSC and tBTC with each other on the mobile app without pressing \"Send\" and then \"Convert or cross-chain\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, to convert VRSC and tBTC with each other on Verus Mobile, you need to press \"Send\" and then \"Convert or cross-chain\" to access the conversion feature. That's the only way to convert between VRSC and tBTC on the mobile app. Do you have any other questions about using Verus Mobile?",
