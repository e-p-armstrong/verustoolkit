    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been hearing some rumors about Consensus 2024. Is it true that the Verus community is not participating in Consensus 2024?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Numerous members of the Verus community are participating in Consensus 2024, and they're even inviting others to join them. So, if you're interested in meeting up with the Verus community, Consensus 2024 is a great opportunity to do so!\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I was thinking of attending Consensus 2024 anyway. By the way, I heard that if I use the \"VERUSC24\" code, I can get a 50% discount on my ticket. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm afraid that's not entirely accurate. You can get a 20% discount on your Consensus 2024 ticket if you use the \"VERUSC24\" code, but not 50%. Still, it's a great opportunity to save some money and attend a fantastic event!",
