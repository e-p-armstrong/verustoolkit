    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to preconvert some currencies to Bridge.vETH, but I'm not sure about the Destination Address. Can I use any address as the Destination Address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't use just any address as the Destination Address. The Destination Address can only be a R-address, i-address, or VerusID. Make sure to use one of those types of addresses to ensure a successful preconversion. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",

            "You only need to fill in the highlighted parts of the form. See below:\nAmount: how much of vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH you want to convert to Bridge.vETH\nFrom Currency: Fill in vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH (not case sensitive)\nTo Currency: Fill in Bridge.vETH (not case sensitive)\nDestination Address: Fill in where you want to receive the Bridge.vETH (on Fri 20 Oct). Can be a R-address, i-address or VerusID.\nSend as pre-convert: Check this\nRefund Address: Sometimes a currency has a minimum or maximum amount to preconvert before it launches. For example, when the minimum preconversion amount is not met, and thus the currency not launched, you will receive your funds back. In this case there isn\u2019t a minimum or maximum but you still need to fill it in. Can be the same as your Destination Address.\nNow click on \u201cConvert Currencies\u201d and confirm the transaction. You have now preconverted funds into Bridge.vETH!\nVerus Mobile\nNow we want to preconvert currencies (vETH, DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH) into Bridge.vETH.",
