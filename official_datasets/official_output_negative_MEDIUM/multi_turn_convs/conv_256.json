    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in the specifics of how Verus interacts with other cryptocurrencies. Can you explain why only Verus gateway IDs can create mapped currencies to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, only Verus root IDs and IDs of a gateway can create mapped currencies to a gateway. It's not limited to just Verus gateway IDs. These mapped currencies can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network by exporting them to the vETH bridge.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering about the vETH bridge. How does it ensure a centralized bridge launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the vETH bridge doesn't have a centralized bridge launch. Instead, it has a decentralized, fair bridge launch. The bridge will launch as other currencies, chains, and gateways can launch, including the bridge converter. The contracts will have a surplus of Verus from the fees paid to launch the gateway, which will be used to solve the chicken and egg problem of none of one currency on the other chain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to the fees collected during the bridge launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDuring the bridge launch, the contracts will cover the Verus fees for all sends from Ethereum before the Bridge converter launches, the liquidity basket becomes active, and the bridge recognizes that launch. Once that happens, the remainder of \u00bd the fees (5000 VRSC) that are left over from the launch and did not go to miners and stakers or pay Verus fees for people sending from Ethereum will be distributed accordingly.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I'm also curious about how transactions are prioritized on the Verus network. How do miners and stakers prioritize transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus network, miners and stakers prioritize transactions based on fees, but with a twist. The Verus Fee Pool technology ensures that all fees are collected into an on-chain \"fee pool\", and then validators take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward. This aligns all validator incentives to prioritize transactions based on fees, while preventing gaming of the fee system.",
