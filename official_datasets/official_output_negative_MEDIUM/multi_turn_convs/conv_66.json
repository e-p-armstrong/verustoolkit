Where can I ask questions or get help about Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you need help or have questions, you're encouraged to ask on Discord. We've got a great community there that's always happy to help out with any issues or questions you might have.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, I'll definitely check it out. Can I download a mobile app to try fractional reserve currencies on testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, there is no mobile app available for that. Instead, you can download the Verus Desktop application to try fractional reserve currencies on testnet. It's a great way to experiment with the technology and see how it works.\n\n**User:**\nI've been trying to connect with the Verus community, but I'm not sure where to find them. Is the Verus community only active on Twitter and Discord?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus community is active on multiple platforms. You can also find the community on Facebook, YouTube, Medium, Reddit, BitcoinTalk, Community Telegram, and has separate Twitter accounts for Community, VerusID, and VerusPay.
