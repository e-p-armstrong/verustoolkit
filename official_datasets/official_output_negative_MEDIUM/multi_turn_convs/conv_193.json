    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to figure out how to use Verus Vault to unlock funds for security, vesting, trusts, inheritance, and more. Can you walk me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some misunderstanding. Verus Vault is actually used to lock funds for security, vesting, trusts, inheritance, and more, not unlock them. It provides a solution to truly secure your blockchain funds. Would you like me to explain more about how Verus Vault works and how it can be used for securing funds?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the correction. I've also been trying to figure out how to use VerusID (NFT) Marketplace to privately exchange VerusIDs with intermediaries. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I need to correct you again. You can't use VerusID (NFT) Marketplace to exchange VerusIDs with intermediaries. Instead, it allows you to buy and sell VerusIDs in a completely decentralized way without any intermediaries. You can use the marketplace to exchange VerusIDs publicly and privately, but without the need for intermediaries. Would you like me to explain more about how the VerusID Marketplace works?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about VerusIDs, but I'm still not sure what they are. Are they just a typical digital identity that can be taken away from you at any time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are not just a typical digital identity. Once you own a VerusID on the Verus blockchain or a compatible PBaaS blockchain, it's yours forever, rent-free, fully under your control. You have complete ownership and control over your VerusID, and it can't be taken away from you. VerusIDs are a form of crypto-address that provides a unique identifier for sending and receiving digital assets, and they offer a range of benefits including revocability, recoverability, privacy, and full decentralization. Do you have any other questions about VerusIDs or how they work?",
