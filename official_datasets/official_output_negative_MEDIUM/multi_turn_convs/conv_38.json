    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to set up my Verus node for mining. I've been told to use the `verus setgenerate true` command, but I'm not sure how it works. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been a mistake. The command `verus setgenerate true` doesn't actually exist. To enable mining, you'll need to add `mint=1` to your `VRSC.conf` file or pass the `-mint` flag when launching `verusd`. The `verus setgenerate` command is used to disable or enable staking and mining, and it only takes a `false` argument to disable both. Would you like more information on configuring your node for mining?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I was also looking at the output of `verus getmininginfo`, and I'm not sure what the \"stakingsupply\" figure means. Can you explain it to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"stakingsupply\" figure is not the total amount of Verus coins in existence. It's an estimate of how much Verus has been staking on the whole network recently. You can use this figure to calculate your approximate chances of staking any given block by dividing your eligible staking balance (funds at least 150 blocks old in transparent addresses or IDs) by the staking supply. This can give you an idea of your staking power relative to the rest of the network. Do you have any other questions about staking or mining?\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing - I've heard of StakeGuard, and I'm trying to configure it to receive staking rewards from all nodes on the network. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been a misunderstanding. StakeGuard is not a system for receiving staking rewards from all nodes on the network. It's a system for solving the Nothing-at-Stake problem. By configuring StakeGuard, you have a chance of receiving the ill-gotten staking rewards from those who are trying to cheat the network or make mistakes in staking their wallet from different computers at the same time. To enable StakeGuard, you need to configure it to send proceeds to a specific address, not receive rewards from all nodes. Would you like more information on how StakeGuard works and how to configure it?",
