    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and notaries, and I'm a bit confused. How do notaries play no role in the cross-chain operations and proof models in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, notaries do play a role in cross-chain operations and proof models in Verus. In fact, notaries are involved in two of the three proof models: decentralized consensus-achieved, witness-dependent, cross-chain cryptographic proofs (notary-dependent notarization) and semi-centralized or centrally controlled gateway proofs. Even in full auto-notarization, which is available between Verus and PBaaS chains, notaries are not completely eliminated, as the protocol will fall back to notary-dependent notarization if auto-notarization is not possible.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I was wondering, can earned notarizations be created by anyone, including users on Ethereum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, earned notarizations can only be created by Verus or PBaaS chain miners and stakers. They are created by adding a notarization output to the coinbase, and are subject to further confirmation rules.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. One more question: what is the primary difference between \"earned\" and \"accepted\" notarizations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo be honest, there is no clear distinction between \"earned\" and \"accepted\" notarizations. VIP defines two types of cross-system notarizations, earned and accepted, but does not elaborate on the differences between them.",
