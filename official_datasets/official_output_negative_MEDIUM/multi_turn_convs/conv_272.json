    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I just set up a new droplet and I'm a bit confused about the password situation. Why do I need to login to my new droplet using the root password emailed to me in order to change the root password to something less secure?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misunderstanding! You don't need to change the root password to something less secure. In fact, it's recommended to set a new root password that is highly secure and complex, and not used elsewhere. This is to ensure the security of your droplet. You should aim to create a strong and unique password to protect your droplet from unauthorized access.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, I guess. But, can I use password authentication to login to my droplet instead of setting up SSH with my SSH Key?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's recommended to setup SSH to use your SSH Key for logging into your Droplet instead of password authentication. This is a more secure way to access your droplet. SSH Keys provide a more secure and reliable way to authenticate, and they're less prone to brute-force attacks. So, it's highly recommended to set up SSH with your SSH Key for secure access to your droplet.",

            " right. This opens a new console window, which looks just like a terminal window.\nPart Three \u2014 Configure The Droplet\nNow that the droplet is setup and online, you\u2019ll want to configure it for use as your Verus staking server. Following are my recommendations and in my opinion, the best practices.\nStep 1 \u2014 New Root Password\nSet a new root password straight away! To do this, login to your new droplet using the Console from the Management within your Digital Ocean account using the root password emailed to you. Your droplet will prompt you to reset your password (create a new one). Use a highly secure and complex password that you do not use elsewhere.\nStep 2 \u2014 Setup SSH\nNext, setup SSH to use your SSH Key for logging into your Droplet (instead of password authentication). If you don\u2019t know how, follow this guide: How to Add SSH Keys to Your Droplet.\nBefore removing root SSH privilege, follow the next step to create a new account in your Droplet.\nStep 3 \u2014 Setup New Secure User Account\nNext, you need to setup a new user account in the Droplet which will run Verus and be your access to the system, so root is not used for access.\nHere are the steps to create a new user account, give it \u201csudo\u201d privileges, test it and disable root SSH:\nYou\u2019ll create the new user account with: adduser username make sure to change username to the username you want to use for this account. You\u2019ll have prompts for Full Name, etc\u2026but the only important thing is setting the secure password for this account. Make it as secure as your root password!\nAfter the user account is created, give it sudo privileges with: \nusermod -aG sudo username again, replace username with the username you created.\nNext, log off the server and test that you can SSH using the new user account.\nIf it went well, it will login fine and you can now remove root SSH privilege:\n- Open the sshd_config file as sudo to edit:\nsudo nan",
