    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been doing some research on Verus and I had a few questions. What was the main motivation behind Verus' Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2018?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus didn't have an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2018. In fact, Verus had a 100% fair launch with no ICO and no premine, as announced on BCT on May 21, 2018. This decision was made to ensure a fair and transparent launch of the project.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. When was the Verus Foundation formation announced?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Foundation formation was announced on July 30, 2018. This marked an important milestone in the development of the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been reading about some of the forks that have taken place in the Verus network. What was the outcome of the Sapling fork at block 227520?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Sapling fork at block 227520 was a seamless fork to the latest upgrade, which incorporated Sapling and a modified Crypto Conditions \"Stake Guard\" to solve the nothing-at-stake problem. The fork was a success and helped to further improve the security and functionality of the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about the VerusHash 2.0 Fork at block 310,000? How did that go?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusHash 2.0 Fork at block 310,000 was an outstanding success and the smoothest fork to date. The upgrade was a significant improvement to the network and demonstrated the ability of the Verus community to come together and implement changes that benefit the project as a whole.",
