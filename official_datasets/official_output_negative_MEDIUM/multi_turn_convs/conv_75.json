    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the decentralized internet and Verus, and I wanted to clarify something. According to Verus, the decentralized internet will emerge as a single, centralized \"global computer\" where all applications are programmed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. According to Verus, the decentralized internet will not emerge as a single, centralized \"global computer\" where all applications are programmed. Instead, it will consist of heterogeneous systems exchanging data that they can all understand, with some being centralized and others being decentralized. Functionality will be triggered from one system to another, with secure systems including their most important functions at the protocol level. Verus envisions a decentralized internet that is more diverse and flexible, rather than a single, centralized system.\n\n**User:**\nI also read about Bell's Law, which states that a new computer class forms every century, resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new industry. Is this correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Bell's Law actually states that roughly every decade a new, lower-priced computer class forms based on a new programming platform, network, and interface, resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new industry. So, it's a much shorter timeframe than every century.\n\n**User:**\nAnd one more thing. I was reading about Verus's view on the current computing paradigm, and it seemed to suggest that it has brought us perfect security, complete privacy, and unlimited innovation opportunities. Is this true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. According to Verus, our current computing paradigm has brought us new toys, tools, and businesses, but it has also led to giant internet monopolies that abuse their power and stifle freedom, innovation, and wealth creation. It is also noted for constant security breaches and a perceived impossibility to protect even our most important systems from intrusion. Privacy is a non-feature and is often abused. Verus believes that we need a new paradigm that prioritizes security, privacy, and decentralization.",
