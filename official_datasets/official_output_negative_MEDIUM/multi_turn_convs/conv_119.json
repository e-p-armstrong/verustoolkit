You can access it at Verus.io/discord. It's a great place to connect with the community, ask questions, and share your thoughts.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks for letting me know! I've also encountered a bug while using Verus, and I was wondering if there's a way to submit a bug report on the Verus website?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, there's no way to submit a bug report directly on the Verus website. However, you can still report the bug and get help by joining the discussion on the Verus Discord. You can share the details of the bug you encountered, and our community and developers will be happy to assist you. Just head over to Verus.io/discord and let us know what's going on!",
