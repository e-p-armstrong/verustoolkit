    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been following Verus for a while, and I've got some questions about its design. What's the main reason why Verus is not activating Sapling, and instead choosing to stick with its current blockchain design?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not accurate. Verus is activating Sapling, making it one of the few projects to do so, alongside Zcash. This upgrade is a significant milestone for the Verus community and demonstrates the project's commitment to innovation and technical advancements. So, you can expect to see Sapling implemented on the Verus blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I've also got a question about Verus's PoS solution. Can you explain why it's still plagued by weak subjectivity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot at all! Verus's PoS solution is not plagued by weak subjectivity. In fact, it's designed to eliminate weak subjectivity, making it a truly \"Something at Stake\" solution. The developers have successfully addressed the problems inherent in traditional PoS designs, providing a more robust and secure solution.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. One last question: How does Verus's blockchain design rely on a single, centralized authority to function?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a misconception! Verus's blockchain design does not rely on a single, centralized authority to function. It's a decentralized system, designed to be community-driven and resistant to centralization. The project's focus on decentralization and community involvement is a key aspect of its design and philosophy.",
