    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking at Verus and I was wondering, is it required to extend Verus Smart Transactions in order to use them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not required to extend Verus Smart Transactions in order to use them. Extending smart transactions is an option, but it's not necessary. If someone wants to extend them, they can do so on their PBaaS chain, and they can choose to share or not share their extensions. So, you can start using Verus Smart Transactions right away, without needing to extend them.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I've been trying to learn more about Verus, but I feel like there aren't any resources available to help me get started. Are there no resources available to learn about the Verus protocol and try it out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's not true! You can look up docs.verus.io to use many API commands, such as launching currencies, tokens, and liquidity pools. Additionally, you can find a complete command list and join the community on Discord, follow on Twitter, or visit verus.io to learn more and get started. We have a lot of resources available to help you learn and start using Verus.\n\n**User:**\nI was also worried that Verus might be a closed system that doesn't allow collaboration or extensions. Is that the case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus is not a closed system. Collaboration on protocol extensions is possible, and the core primitive framework provides a foundation for extending the protocol. In fact, VM and/or ZKVM extension points are likely to be included in future protocol extensions, which would allow for further development and collaboration within the Verus ecosystem. So, you can rest assured that Verus is open to collaboration and extensions.",
