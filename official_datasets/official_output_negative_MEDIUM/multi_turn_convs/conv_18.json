    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into creating a public blockchain on Verus, but I'm worried it might be too complicated for me. Isn't creating a public blockchain on Verus a complicated process that requires extensive technical knowledge and a lot of VerusCoin?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI understand your concern, but actually, creating a public blockchain on Verus is a relatively simple process that can be done through an intuitive GUI wallet. Anyone with a little bit of VerusCoin (or Verus Test Coin) can define and start up their own public blockchain in minutes. The process is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users, not just technical experts. You don't need to be a technical genius to create a public blockchain on Verus!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! I've also heard that only a limited number of miners can merge-mine my new chain with Verus. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Any miner can see your new chain as soon as it's created and merge-mine your chain with Verus, along with 13 other chains. This means that the hash power on Verus will also apply to your chain, bolstering its security and making it more resistant to attacks. So, you don't have to worry about finding a specific miner to merge-mine your chain; any miner can do it, and your chain will benefit from the collective hash power of the Verus network.",
