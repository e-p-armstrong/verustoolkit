    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about updating my VerusCoin Graphical (GUI) Wallet. Can I update it to the latest version without shutting down the wallet and backing up my wallet.dat files?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. You must shutdown Agama and/or Verus wallet and backup your wallet.dat files for ALL coins you have activated before updating your VerusCoin Graphical (GUI) Wallet to the latest version. This is an important step to ensure the safety of your coins and to prevent any potential losses.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been wondering about the relationship between Verus wallet and Agama. Are they completely separate projects with no shared components?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, they're not completely separate projects. In fact, Verus wallet is a modified and enhanced build of Agama, relying on the same daemon (komodod) in the background. This means that Verus includes enhancements such as mining, staking, and latest zero knowledge Sapling features built on top of the Agama foundation.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question: can I use any version of the Verus wallet, and it will work fine with the latest nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, all nodes, CLI or GUI, must be v0.5.3 or later (0.5.1 on Mac) unless otherwise announced on the official Verus Discord or Medium. You should update your wallet immediately if you are running an older version to ensure compatibility and security.",
