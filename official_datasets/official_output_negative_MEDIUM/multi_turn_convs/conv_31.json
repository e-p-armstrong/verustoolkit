    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I was wondering about VerusID profiles. I've heard that you can't create a VerusID profile with images, videos, and posts. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a common misconception! You can create a VerusID profile with images, videos, and posts. In fact, VerusID profiles can also contain proofs of ownership of social media accounts, websites, or crypto addresses. You have total control over your profile, and it's decentralized, so you don't have to worry about someone else controlling your content. We use Arweave, a decentralized storage provider, for data storage, but other storage providers can also be used.\n\n**User:**\nBut what's the point of creating a VerusID profile if you can be deplatformed? I thought that was the whole point of decentralized identities.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! But actually, one of the benefits of creating a VerusID profile is that you can't be deplatformed. You have total control over your profile, and it's decentralized, so you don't have to worry about someone else controlling your content or shutting you down. Your profile is yours, and you get to decide what happens to it.",
