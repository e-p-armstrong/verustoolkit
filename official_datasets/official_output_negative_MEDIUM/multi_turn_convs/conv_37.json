    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few more questions about VerusIDs. Can users create subIDs for free?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, users cannot create subIDs for free. Creating a subID costs 0.00021 tBTC.vETH (in Pure), and these costs are burned, reducing the amount of Pure in circulation. However, if users create an identity with a referral subID, they pay 2/3 less, and the referrer gets 1/3 of the cost.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been wondering about Pure, the cryptocurrency used in the Verus ecosystem. Was the initial supply of Pure dynamic from the start?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the initial supply of Pure was not dynamic from the start. The initial supply of Pure was 20,000, and it only became dynamic after the initial supply was distributed by the protocol. When users convert from VRSC or tBTC into Pure, Pure is minted, and when they convert from Pure back to VRSC or tBTC, the Pure is burned.\n\n**User:**\nI see. And what about converting between VRSC and tBTC? Can users do that at any time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, conversions between VRSC and tBTC were not possible before the preconversion period ended on Sunday, 24 March, 2024.",
