    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm interested in the bounty for submitting a qualifying GPU or FPGA miner implementation. Can you tell me, what is the deadline for submitting a qualifying implementation to receive the bounty?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe bounty offer will automatically end 90 days after the release, which would be prior to March 20, 2019. So, you'll need to submit your implementation before that date to be eligible for the bounty.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks for letting me know. If I do submit a qualifying implementation, how much VRSC can I expect to receive as a bounty?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA qualifying GPU software miner will receive 50,000 VRSC as a bounty, which will be provided as addresses holding time-locked VRSC that will release uniformly over the next 1 year and ~8.5 months.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question, do I need to make my miner implementation open source and available to the community before using it in secret? Or can I use it in secret first and then make it open source?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, according to the rules, the code must be made open source and available to the community **without** first being used in secret. So, you'll need to make your implementation open source and available to the community from the start.",

The bounty of each is for the first implementation of a competitive miner for VerusHash 2.0 for that particular hardware type with some stipulations:\nThe code must be made open source and available to the community without first being used in secret.\nTo qualify, the miner implementation must beat the best CPU hash rate by at least 1.5x hash rate for a comparably priced CPU-to-device.\nFor GPUs the target GPU individually performing the qualifying hash rate must be common (and available to the general public) nVidia or AMD devices. For FPGAs, the hardware performing the qualifying hash rate must be easily available and under $1250 per device.\nSubmitted and qualifying implementations must be completed, working, and in a form that can be easily tested by a representative of the Verus Coin Foundation. This bounty offer will automatically end 90 days after this release (prior to March 20, 2019) and may be renewed by the Verus Coin Foundation at its sole discretion. Entries submitted will also be determined eligible for a bounty at the sole discretion of the Verus Coin Foundation and its representatives.\nFor a qualifying GPU software miner, over and above any additional bounties earned by any qualifying developer, the bounty will be 50,000 VRSC. For a qualifying FPGA development, over and above any additional bounties earned by any qualifying developer, the bounty will be 100,000 VRSC.
