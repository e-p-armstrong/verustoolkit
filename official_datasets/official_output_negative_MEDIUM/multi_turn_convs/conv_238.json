    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit confused about how Verus plans to handle wallets for its users. Can you tell me more about how Verus plans to implement a centralized wallet system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus does not plan to implement a centralized wallet system. Instead, the Verus wallet is designed to provide users with control over their own assets and transactions, rather than relying on a central authority. This approach ensures that users have full control and autonomy over their digital assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been wondering about Sapling transactions in Verus. Does Verus support Sapling transactions in its Electrum Server?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, Verus supports Sapling transactions in its Electrum Server. In fact, Verus has enhanced its Electrum Server for Sapling support, making Lite Mode Sapling Z-Transactions possible. The lead developer, Mike Toutonghi, coded the support into the Verus Electrum server, which has been fully tested and seamlessly activated along with the blockchain Sapling activation.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard some rumors that Verus hasn't developed any pool software to support Sapling transactions. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that is not true. Verus has coded Sapling-enabled pool software, demonstrating its commitment to the community and the project. This pool software is fully compatible with Sapling transactions, ensuring a seamless experience for users.",
