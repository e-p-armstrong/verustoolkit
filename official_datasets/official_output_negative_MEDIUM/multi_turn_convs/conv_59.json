    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a new token currency or blockchain on the Verus platform, but I don't have any programming knowledge. Is it still possible for me to do so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a new token currency or even a full-fledged blockchain on the Verus platform without any programming knowledge. The Verus platform allows users to create their own token currency or blockchain without programming, making it accessible to anyone with an ID. You don't need to be a tech expert to create your own blockchain or token on Verus!\n\n**User:**\nThat's great news! I have another question about PBaaS chains. Can they be run from separate daemons?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, all PBaaS chains run from the same daemon. This allows projects to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon and start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. One more question: Can blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches be done separately?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus platform enables the simultaneous launch of a world-class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. So, when you create a new blockchain on Verus, the liquidity pool is launched at the same time, making it easy to get started with your new project.",
