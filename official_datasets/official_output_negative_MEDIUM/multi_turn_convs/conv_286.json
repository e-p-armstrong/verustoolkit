    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about the bridge launching soon and I'm wondering, how do I benefit from moving my ETH, DAI, and MKR to the Verus blockchain after the bridge is launched?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you need to move your ETH, DAI, and MKR to the Verus blockchain before the bridge is launched to benefit from subsidized cross-chain fees. Around 5000 VRSC is used to subsidize the fees on the Verus side. If you wait until after the bridge is launched, you won't be able to take advantage of this subsidy. So, it's essential to move your assets before the launch to get the benefits.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been wondering, is the Bridge.vETH supply fixed and unchanging?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Bridge.vETH supply is dynamic. It gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, vETH, DAI.vETH, and MKR.vETH, or gets burned when people convert out of it. This means that the supply of Bridge.vETH can change over time based on user activity.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the DSR contract and I'm curious, do DAI holders get 10% interest when holding in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, DAI holders get 5% interest (at the time of writing, the rate is subject to change by MakerDAO) automatically when holding in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. This interest is passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question: Can I only use the Bridge.vETH currency in one direction after it's launched?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, after Bridge.vETH is launched and the initial supply is distributed, you can convert into any direction. This means you can convert between different currencies and assets in both directions, not just one way. You'll have the flexibility to use Bridge.vETH as you see fit.",
