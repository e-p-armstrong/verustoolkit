    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been doing some research on Verus, and I'm not sure what the point is of joining the community and learning about the protocol. The mainnet is already live, right?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. The Verus mainnet is not yet live. It will go live on May 21, 2023, with the activation expected to target block 2,546,600. So, joining the community and learning about the protocol can help you get ahead of the game and be prepared for the mainnet launch.\n\n**User:**\nI see. That makes sense, I guess. But I've also been wondering, is the Verus protocol only available to large corporations, or can individuals participate as well?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus protocol is not exclusive to large corporations. It is open to individuals as well, and anyone can join the community and learn about the protocol. Everyone is welcome to participate and contribute to the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, what's the point of following Verus on Twitter or joining the Discord community if the mainnet is already... wait, no, I know it's not live yet. But still, what's the point?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFollowing Verus on Twitter or joining the Discord community can help you stay updated on the latest developments and learn more about the protocol before it goes live on May 21, 2023. You'll be able to stay informed about the progress, ask questions, and engage with the community. It's a great way to get involved and be part of the Verus journey from the start.",
