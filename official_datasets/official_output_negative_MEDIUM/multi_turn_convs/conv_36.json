    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI was wondering, how do you export a currency from one PBaaS-blockchain to another without paying any fees?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to help! However, I have to correct you - it's not possible to export a currency from one PBaaS-blockchain to another without paying any fees. When you export a currency from one PBaaS-blockchain to another, you need to pay a fee, which is defined by the PBaaS-chain where you want the currency to be exported to. This fee can be paid in any currency that is available in the bridge-converter. The fee goes to the miners and stakers of the network.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But I had another question - can you only use the native currency of a blockchain to pay for transactions on that blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not the case. You can use any currency that is in the bridge-converter as a fee to do operations on any PBaaS-blockchain. For example, if you have USDC on the Verus-blockchain, you don't need VRSC to send the USDC around. It automatically converts a small fee of USDC to VRSC through a bridge-converter and uses that as its transaction fee.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard some rumors about the Verus multichain protocol. Is it true that it's still in its conceptual phase and hasn't made any significant progress recently?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. According to the latest updates, a lot of quiet progress was made on the development of the Verus multichain protocol last month, and a new public testnet is on the verge of release with additional core protocol features. The development is actively moving forward, and we can expect to see more exciting updates soon!",

All effort is put into making Verus a decentralized and robust protocol that just works.\nExporting Currencies\nCurrencies on one PBaaS-blockchain can be exported to any other PBaaS-blockchain. This means that a currency can easily be made available on multiple blockchains.\nAn example: we have CHICKEN-currency on a PBaaS-chain and want it to be available on the Verus-blockchain as well. We export CHICKEN-currency to the Verus-blockchain for a fee and now CHICKEN-currency is available there too. It goes without saying that all fees go to the miners and stakers of the network.\nWe can pay this fee in whatever currency we want, as long as it is available in the bridge-converter.\nThis fee is defined by the PBaaS-chain where you want the currency to be exported to, and thus can differ within all the multiple blockchains in the network.\nFee Structures\nOn the previous public testnet you could only make transactions if you had the native currency of the blockchain. Now you can use any currency that is in the bridge-converter as a fee to do operations on any PBaaS-blockchain.\nAny currency on a blockchain can be used as fees to do transactions. Example: if you have USDC on the Verus-blockchain you don\u2019t need VRSC to send the USDC around.

Yet it is working now on internal Verus test builds.",
