    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm not really sure about updating my Verus wallet after the mainnet upgrade. What's the main benefit of not updating my Verus wallet after the mainnet upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there is no benefit to not updating your Verus wallet after the mainnet upgrade. In fact, not updating your wallet may prevent you from taking advantage of the new features and may lead to issues with the smooth operation of your wallet. You should update your wallet as soon as possible to ensure smooth operations.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the partnership between Verus and Digital Nation Entertainment. How does it affect the use of VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe partnership between Verus and Digital Nation Entertainment does not directly affect the use of VerusIDs. The partnership is focused on creating high-quality digital worlds and metaverse environments, with Digital Nation Entertainment committing to exclusively work with Verus on the blockchain side of their metaverse environments. VerusIDs are a separate feature that allows for the exchange of VerusIDs publicly and privately, and the use of Verus Vault for locking funds for various purposes.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What about the partnership between Arkeytyp and Digital Nation Entertainment? I heard that the Verus Coin Foundation receives all the proceeds from that partnership.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not entirely accurate. Arkeytyp donates 50% of the proceeds from this relationship to the Verus Coin Foundation, not 100%.",
