    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how Verus works. How does Verus handle scalability issues, given that it's a centralized system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misunderstanding. Verus is not a centralized system. In fact, it's a decentralized financial network that can scale out as needed to meet various requirements, whether they're for centralized corporate, open government, or fully decentralized applications. Verus is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different use cases. Do you have any other questions about Verus or its scalability?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What are the rental fees associated with using Verus, a decentralized financial network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are no rental fees associated with using Verus. Verus is a credibly neutral, rent-free, decentralized financial network, which means that it operates without charging users any fees for its services. This is a key benefit of using Verus, as it allows users to access its features and functionality without incurring additional costs. Would you like to know more about how Verus operates or its benefits?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. Is Verus a closed, proprietary system controlled by a single entity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus is not a closed, proprietary system controlled by a single entity. It's an open, community-driven model that enables it to be a decentralized financial network. This openness and community-driven approach allow Verus to operate in a credibly neutral and rent-free manner. Verus is designed to be transparent, collaborative, and community-focused, which sets it apart from traditional, closed systems. Do you have any other questions about Verus or its architecture?",
