    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm interested in learning more about social tokens. How do they currently function without built-in direct liquidity, and why is it necessary to have an automated market maker to be a liquid token?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, social tokens can function with built-in direct liquidity, eliminating the need for an automated market maker. This concept, pioneered by the Bancor project, allows users to convert into and out of the token directly, after being \"seeded\" by the founder. This approach eliminates liquidity provider risk, and every holder of the token provides liquidity automatically, leading to more market depth, stability, and predictability in value.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've heard that ERC-20 names are often used for social tokens. What's the main benefit of using ERC-20 names for social tokens, and how do they enable the creation of namespaces?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nERC-20 names are not suitable for creating namespaces because they are not cryptographically unique. In contrast, a different model for tokens, where their friendly names are defined in the protocol and processed as UTXOs just like native blockchain currency, enables the creation of namespaces. This approach allows tokens to have unique names that can serve as the root of a namespace.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that social tokens are often limited to a fixed supply. Why are social tokens limited to a fixed supply, and how does this impact their value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSocial tokens with built-in direct liquidity can have a dynamic supply, where more tokens are automatically minted in response to increasing demand, and burned if the demand reverses. This approach allows social tokens to adapt to changing market conditions, leading to a more stable and predictable value.",
