    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with my Vault. How do I unlock it without revoking and recovering my VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDon't worry, I'm here to help. Actually, you can unlock a Vault without revoking and recovering your VerusID. If you chose TimeLock, you can simply wait for the determined period to pass, and the assets will be spendable again. If you chose DelayLock, you can request an unlock and then wait for the cooldown period to pass before the assets can be spent again. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, thanks. I was thinking, though, would it be possible to combine both TimeLock and DelayLock options to lock my Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, you can only choose one option to lock your Vault, either TimeLock or DelayLock. You cannot choose both options simultaneously. You need to decide which one works best for your needs. Do you have any other questions about Vaults or VerusIDs in general?",
