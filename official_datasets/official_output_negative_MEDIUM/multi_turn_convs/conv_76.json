    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand more about namespaces on a blockchain protocol. Are namespaces on a blockchain protocol limited to only allowing numerical identifiers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. A protocol could allow unique friendly name identifiers within a namespace, meaning fans could register identities/names that are associated with the namespace, eg. \u201cfan.influencer@\u201d, or an influencer could assign meaningful names to digital goods attached to their namespace, eg. \u201cticket0001.influencer@\u201d or \u201ccoolnft.influencer@\u201d or \u201cschedule.influencer@\u201d. This suggests that namespaces can have human-readable and descriptive identifiers, not just numerical ones. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Another thing I was wondering about is control of objects on a namespace. Can objects on a namespace only be controlled by a single private key?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Objects on a namespace can be controlled by private keys and can be transferable from one set of private keys to another, either by command, or in an atomic swap transaction. This implies that objects can be controlled by multiple private keys, and can be transferred between them. So, you have more flexibility in terms of control and transfer of objects on a namespace. Do you have any more questions about namespaces or objects on a namespace?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. Are objects on a namespace only used for simple identification purposes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Objects on a namespace can have various functionalities, such as receiving, sending, and holding funds, controlling other objects, receiving messages, and being unique points in a communications network. They can also contain metadata, and leverage data structures and off-chain storage to allow for arbitrary and updateable data to be associated with the object. This suggests that objects on a namespace can have a wide range of uses and applications. They're not just limited to simple identification purposes. Does that help clarify things for you?",
