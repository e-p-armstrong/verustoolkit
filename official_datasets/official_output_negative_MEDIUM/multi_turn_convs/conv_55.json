    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few more questions about VerusIDs. What is the purpose of a secondary address in a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, there is no concept of a secondary address in a VerusID. A VerusID has a primary address, which is the owner of the VerusID and contains the private key, and an identity address (also called i-address), which is the identifier of the VerusID.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Another thing I was wondering, can I create a VerusID for free?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, creating a VerusID requires a small fee, which goes to the miners and stakers of the network. This fee is a necessary part of maintaining the security and integrity of the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I've also been trying to understand Vaults better. What happens when a Vault is in the \"UNLOCKED\" state?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is no \"UNLOCKED\" state. A Vault can be in one of three states: \"LOCKED\", \"UNLOCK SOON\", or \"NO LOCK\". The \"UNLOCK SOON\" state means the Vault is locked but will get unlocked within a time period of 30 days. Does that clarify things for you?",
