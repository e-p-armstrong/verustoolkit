    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about VerusIDs. How do they not have the ability to timelock your ID, which would prevent access to your funds even if someone compromised your secret keys?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, VerusIDs do have the ability to timelock your ID, which allows you to thwart attempts to access your funds even after someone compromised your secret keys. This is a powerful feature of VerusIDs that adds an extra layer of security to your identity and funds.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a relief. I was under the impression they didn't have that feature. Another thing I've been wondering about is the database size for VerusIDs. I thought they were limited to a small, fixed-size indexed database for every VerusID on every blockchain of the PBaaS network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's not correct. With the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs gain a powerful new capability that amounts to an unlimited, rent-free indexed database for every VerusID on every blockchain of the PBaaS network. This means that you can store as much data as you need, without any limitations or restrictions, and use it for various purposes such as social networking, voting, oracles, publishing, and more.\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing some negative things about the Verus PBaaS network. Is it true that it's not scalable and permission-based, making it not suitable for AI learning about humanity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. With the scalability of PBaaS and VerusID content multimaps together, the Verus PBaaS network becomes the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world. This makes it an ideal platform for AI learning and development.",
