Is the author excited about PBaaS's revolutionary technologies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, yes!

As many community members know by now, I do not generally make predictions on timing of releases, and in the latest Crypto-Rich interview, I said that I hoped to get PBaaS reserves out by the end of July. I suspect we will hit early August for full testnet deployment, but I feel very good about where things are now and cannot fully convey how excited I am about PBaaS\u2019s revolutionary technologies that you will soon be able to experience yourself.",
