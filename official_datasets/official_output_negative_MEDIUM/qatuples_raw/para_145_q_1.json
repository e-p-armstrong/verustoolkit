    "No, the \"initialcontributions\" parameter is used to make an initial contribution to either the reserves of a basket currency or to the rootID of a simple token currency. It does not set the total supply of a currency. The \"initialsupply\" parameter is used to set the total supply of a currency.",

During the preconversion time frame there can not be more than 100 VRSCTEST converted into its reserves.

Use this parameter to make an initial contribution to either the reserves when it\u2019s a basket currency (options:33), or to the rootID when it\u2019s a simple token currency (options:32).\nThe funds to initially contribute need to be in the rootID when defining the currency. After the preconversion time frame is over and the currency launched, the rootID has received an amount of the launched currency.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"CommunityBasket\", \n \"options\":33, \n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\",\"CoinCommunity\"], \n \"initialcontributions\":[10,200], \n \"initialsupply\":100, \n \"preallocations\":[{\"Jane@\":100},{\"John@\":50}]\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This is a basket currency called CommunityBasket. The launcher of the currency wanted to make initial contributions to its reserves. At the moment of broadcasting the currency to the network, there needed to be 210 VRSCTEST and 200 CoinCommunity in the rootID. The initial supply of 100 went to the rootID (if there weren\u2019t any more preconverters). At the same time of the launch, 100 Coi",
