    "How do multi-reserve currencies distribute their value among the currencies in their liquidity pool?",
    "The distribution of value among currencies in a multi-reserve currency's liquidity pool is not based on market prices or any other dynamic factor. Instead, the value is distributed equally among all currencies in the pool, regardless of their price movement. For example, if a multi-reserve currency contains two currencies, the value is distributed 50/50%. If it contains three currencies, the value is distributed 33/33/33%, and so on.",
    "rencies they contain in their liquidity pool. If they contain two currencies, the value is distributed 50/50%. If three currencies, 33/33/33%, and so on. Regardless of their price movement, this percentage always stays the same.\nA primary use-case for the multi-reserve currencies is the conversion from one currency to another, without the need of any counterparty. Since there is always liquidity inside a multi-reserve currency anyone can convert at any time. For example: a person has ETH and wants to convert to VRSC. He converts first to the multi-reserve currency ETH*VRSC with ETH (one transaction), now he can convert the ETH*VRSC to VRSC (another transaction). Of course, in order for this to operate, ETH will need to be represented on the Verus blockchain. This will be handled by Verus\u2019 decentralized bridging capabilities, and will be discussed in a future article.\nThere is a base fee for conversions of 0.025%, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. There is also an additional implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees.\nAt the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.",
