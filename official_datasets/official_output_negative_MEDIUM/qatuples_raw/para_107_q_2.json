    "Can a Verus DeFi currency only be backed by two reserve currencies in its liquidity pool?",
    "No, a Verus DeFi currency that is backed by 100% can have many more currencies than just two in its liquidity pool. All kinds of combinations are possible, as shown in Image 3.",
    "idity pool of NewCurrency have a value of both $500. Consequently, the value of 1 NewCurrency is $1000 (C).\nImage 2: How the value of a Verus DeFi currency is composed\nSo, depending on what is in the liquidity pool of NewCurrency, the price of the currency fluctuates.

All kinds of combinations are possible (image 3).\nImage 3: A currency backed by 100% can have many different currencies in its liquidity pool\nIn the Verus ecosystem we call a currency that has a pool of liquidity attached to it a \u2018fractional currency\u2019. The currencies that are in the pool of liquidity we call \u2018reserve currencies\u2019, see image 4.\nImage 4: Verus DeFi terminology\nTo make it a bit more complicated, let us explain why we call these currencies \u2018fractional currencies\u2019.
