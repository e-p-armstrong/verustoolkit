    "Can you explain how the focus on evolving the protocol has led to the development of secure primitives in many blockchain networks?",
    "That's not correct. According to the text, the focus has been on pumping and market capture, rather than evolving what can be learned from Bitcoin and other pioneering blockchain networks. As a result, many blockchain networks have not developed secure primitives, but instead have relied on best practices and the evolutionary legacy of thousands of \"dApps\", which are often just partial or full re-implementations of the secure primitives missing in the consensus-based L1 protocols themselves.",

In some cases, the ICO or pre-mined share of ownership was further entrenched by switching from proof of work, as a way for anyone to earn, to pure proof of stake, where owning the network currency is required to earn and those with the most earn the most. As part of prioritizing early growth to capture maximum crypto market share, these platforms generally abdicated the hard work of designing or implementing core protocol primitives, such as currencies or identities, beyond one native currency, as originally conceived in Bitcoin.\nInstead, the popular VM model of many blockchains today, which generally provide a shared \u201ccomputer\u201d or VM on top of a decentralized blockchain, leaves building critical primitives as someone else\u2019s problem, usually companies and app designers, basically writing centralized apps. Instead of a secure set of underlying rules for currencies, we get best practices and the evolutionary legacy of thousands of \u201cdApps\u201d, which ironically, are mostly just partial or full re-implementations of the secure primitives missing in the consensus-based L1 protocols themselves.\nAs a result of the focus on pumping and market capture vs. evolving what we could learn from ",
