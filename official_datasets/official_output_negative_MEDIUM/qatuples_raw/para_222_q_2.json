    "Is it possible to have a 15 of 25 signature setup for minting and burning capabilities in the Verus network?",
    "No, according to the text, any signature setup is possible, but only up to a maximum of 13 of 25.",
    "\ud83d\udcdd Note that this walkthrough is for the Verus Testnet blockchain, which already has the functionalities that the PBaaS-upgrade (Public Blockchains as a Service) will bring to mainnet. Also, the commands are for macOS and Linux, as Windows works a bit differently. We use the CLI wallet for Verus. Download here \ud83d\udd17 You can also use Verus Desktop with its incorporated terminal.\nFictional Company \u201cVery Good Gold\u201d\nIn this technological showcase, we have a fictional company that is an issuer of a centralized token with 1:1 backing of gold. With a starting supply of 0. The issuer of this token has full control of minting and burning capabilities.\nThe mint and burn process however needs to be approved by two signers, making sure one entity doesn\u2019t have full control. For this example we use a 2 of 2 signature setup. Any signature setup is possible (with a maximum of 13 of 25), depending on different use cases.\nDefining a Currency\nDefining a currency on the Verus network is simple, just two commands. When the currency is successfully launched it can flow around within the protocol, and outside of the protocol (learn how to export a currency as an ERC-20 to Ethereum \ud83d\udd17). Let\u2019s get started.\nVerusID NamespaceBefore defining the currency, we already registered the VerusID VGG@. This cost us 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 when using a referral), which were distributed to the block producers. These costs can drastically vary depending on which PBaaS-blockchain we create a VerusID.\nVerusID is the namespace for currencies and PBaaS-blockchains, among many other things.

This means the identity is controlled by two primary addresses, with always two signatures needed to do any action (like launching the currency, minting, burning and sending).\nDefining the currency\nDefining a currency costs 200 VRSCTEST. These costs can change d",
