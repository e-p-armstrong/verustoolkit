    "How does Verus' testnet release in June 2022 demonstrate the protocol's ability to address Ethereum network challenges?",
    "The Verus testnet was actually released on March 6, 2022, not in June 2022. The testnet release demonstrated the protocol's ability to address Ethereum network challenges, such as MEV, scalability, and cross-chain/network interoperability, and paved the way for the planned mainnet launch before Consensus 2022.",

The world\u2019s most influential crypto & blockchain experience of the year. Here tens of thousands of crypto enthusiasts come together to discover the latest industry-leading developments.Verus Addresses Ethereum Network Challenges\nThe Verus protocol addresses challenges that are seen in Ethereum and other networks. Challenges such as MEV (Miner Extractable Value), scalability and cross-chain/network interoperability.\nWith the release of the new Verus testnet (March 6, 2022, see extensive release notes) and the planned mainnet launch before the start of Consensus 2022, Verus can be used as, among many other things, a launch platform for ERC-20 tokens and currencies.\nThrough the Verus Interchain Protocol (VIP, decentralized bridging technology) creators can use the Verus protocol to create currencies and tokens and immediately export them to Ethereum as ERC-20s without needing any Solidity developers or actual programming. Saving costs and having the ability to use the most feature-rich decentralized crypto protocol to date. Currencies and tokens on the Verus protocol can also be created to be mapped 1:1 with any ERC-20 token, making never seen before value transfers possible.\nAll currencies and tokens on the Verus and Ethereum networks can be used with Verus DeFi. Verus DeFi is part of the L1 consensus protocol, which means that all AMM conversions can not be fron",
