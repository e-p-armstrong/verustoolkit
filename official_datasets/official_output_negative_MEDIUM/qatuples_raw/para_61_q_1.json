    "Why can't you use Ethereum currencies with Verus DeFi?",
    "You can use Ethereum currencies with Verus DeFi. The text states that all currencies on the Verus network, including those bridged over from Ethereum, can be used with Verus DeFi.",
    "ly between the Verus and Ethereum networks.\nAll currencies on the Verus network (also the ones bridged over from Ethereum) can be used with Verus DeFi, another primitive inherent to the protocol. Verus DeFi enables liquidity baskets of up to 10 underlying reserve currencies and can serve as a unique, self-balancing, MEV-resistant portfolio, a permissionless or permissioned ID registrar where fees go to the LPs of the basket, or an easy way to send from any reserve currency or the basket currency itself to any other without worrying about block builder reordering or MEV, as all conversions of a liquidity basket in any direction that are processed within one or more blocks are always solved simultaneously, no front and not back. Every conversion gets the same price in each direction with no spread and an ultra low fee (max. 0.05%), again, all part of the L1 consensus.\nWhether you plan to build eCommerce enabled supply chains, massively scalable ownership-based games, real world asset eCommerce enabled networks, voting systems, identity management networks, communication networks, financial networks, 3D metaverses with identities, brands, and ownership or just about any application for a better Web3 on the Internet of Value, you\u2019ll be left behind if you don\u2019t deep dive on Verus first.\nJoin us in the next crypto revolution.
