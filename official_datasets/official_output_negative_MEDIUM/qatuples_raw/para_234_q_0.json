    "How will VerusHash 2.0 make FPGAs the most economical option for mining Verus Coin?",
    "VerusHash 2.0 will not necessarily make FPGAs the most economical option for mining Verus Coin. In fact, the text suggests that if VerusHash 2.0 goes too far, FPGAs might become economically useless for mining Verus Coin. However, the algorithm includes many new parameters that can be adjusted to tune its relative speed on different hardware, should that be necessary.",
    "rusHash 2.0 will significantly close, if not eliminate, the gap between ROI on various types of hardware.\nIf for any reason, VerusHash 2.0 goes too far, and FPGAs become economically useless for mining Verus Coin, which we don\u2019t believe is the likely outcome, we can discuss tuning with the community, as the algorithm includes many new parameters that can be used to adjust its relative speed on different hardware.\nBotnet Resistant\nWhile you can never prevent capable, controlled PCs from being used for mining, it is far more likely that the CPUs in those PCs will be older, rather than the newest models. With VerusHash 2.0, modern CPUs are strongly advantaged over older CPUs, and the newest, advantaged even more.\nDrop in Nethash\nBecause VerusHash 2.0 is doing so much more than its predecessor, one result of this algorithm will be a significant drop in the nethash. It is important to understand that this does not indicate any drop in level of security of the blockchain.\nWhile we hope all of you will fire up your favorite newer CPU to join us in welcoming the new algorithm, the algorithm will not go as fast as the older algorithm on any device, and we should see hashrate numbers closer to the early days of mining Verus. Again, this does NOT reflect any issue with regards to our immunity to 51% hash attacks, as the Verus Proof of Power algorithm is not subject to that vulnerability.\nVerus Agama Improvements\nIn this release of the Verus Enhanced Agama wallet (GUI) we are introducing full support of any Komodo asset running natively alongside Verus Coin. This is done by separating out the daemon for Komodo, allowing both the Verus daemon and the Komodo daemon to run simultaneously.\nThis change will allow us to add native support from other coin daemons in the future as well, while maintaining maximum compatibility with each coin supported. We believe we added all active coins",
