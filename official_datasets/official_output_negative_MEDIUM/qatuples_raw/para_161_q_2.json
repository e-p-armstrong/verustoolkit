    "Is the Verus project still in its Phase One development stage?",
    "No, Phase One, which included the Mainnet, 50/50 PoW/PoS, Time Locks, and Fair Launch, has already been delivered. The project is currently working on Phase Two, which includes Autochains, Polls, and Verus Mobile. There are also future phases planned, including Phase Three, which will focus on Identity and Proof of Virtue, and Phase Four, which will integrate Machine Learning, Content, and Storage.",
    "y, provably zero knowledge transactions, where sender, receiver, and amount are mathematically, provably private and can include encrypted messages as well.\nAt launch there were larger, time locked rewards to the earliest participants, ensuring no risk of significant supply entering the market and being dumped all at once.\nThe VerusHash mining algorithm is built to provide a solution to the current ASIC situation in crypto. Not only is it the fastest CPU mining algorithm in the world right now, but because of the fact that it leverages extreme integration in modern day processors, effectively treating their internals as mini, high speed ASICs, it allows people to mine easily from their laptop or PC and actually earn as much VRSC for their investment as even big miners, because they aren\u2019t competing with specialized, purpose-built machines or on an algorithm where GPUs have a major advantage. \u2014 @MikeToutonghi\nFrom the very beginning, all mining and staking rewards equal to or over 192 Verus were time locked for release and first use randomly over the next 25 months.\nInfographic created by community member @M_eyse\nAs of the next halving where rewards halve to 96 Verus, they will not be time locked and will be available for staking or trading within 100 blocks from being staked or mined.\nProject Roadmap\nDELIVERED Phase One \u2014 Mainnet, 50/50 PoW/PoS , Time Locks and Fair Launch\nWORKING ON Phase Two \u2014 Autochains, Polls and Verus Mobile\nPhase Three \u2014 Identity, and Proof of Virtue\nPhase Four \u2014 Integrated Machine Learning, Content and Storage\nGraphic found in the White Paper\nWhat\u2019s Next? The Verus Coin Foundation.\nTalked to senior team members and I understand there will be a Verus Foundation which will have one purpose, to realise the Verus Vision.
