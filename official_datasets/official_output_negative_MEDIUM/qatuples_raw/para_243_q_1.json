    "Is the staking calculator on the mining dashboard always 100% accurate?",
    "No, the staking calculator on the mining dashboard is not always 100% accurate. According to the text, the calculator is \"always only an estimate\" because the system is based on statistical averages over time and dependent on changing network conditions. The estimates and actual results will vary based on how much Verus is being staked on the rest of the network by all participants at any given moment.",
    "Or, from the mining dashboard you can click on Verus on the left side, then toggle staking on in the main interface.That should get you staking. With staking enabled you\u2019ll get a dashboard showing estimates for potential staking returns given the current network conditions that looks like this:The calculator is always only an estimate, since the whole system is based on statistical averages over time, and dependent on changing network conditions. In particular, these estimates and your results will vary based on how much Verus is being staked on the rest of the network by all participants in any given moment.\nNotice in that calculator that it shows only a portion staking \u2014 this is because a portion of the balance is unavailable for staking, having recently staked, and will be available again in 150 blocks. For more information on this aspect see the UTXO Details section below.\nYou\u2019ll know you\u2019ve successfully staked when you see staking transactions and rewards in your transaction list, and when your balance goes up accordingly.\nVerus Command Line (CLI) Staking How-To\nYou might prefer to use Verus on the command line, either to run on much lighter-weight hardware or headless systems, for the ability to script and integrate with Verus, or just for more granular control over your wallet.\nThis assumes you are already familiar with the command line and have verusd running and have met the other prerequisites for being eligible to stake.\nYou can enable staking in a running wallet using this command:\nverus setgenerate true 0\nThis will turn your mining threads down to zero if you were mining. If you want to also re-enable solo mining you can follow this with:\nverus setgenerate true X\nwhere X is the number of threads y",
