    "Do people need to convert 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID to preconvert to the CompanyX currency, and will they receive 100 CompanyX in exchange?",
    "No, that's not correct. According to the example, people need to convert 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID to preconvert to the CompanyX currency, and in exchange, they will receive 250 CompanyX, not 100.",
    "\u201cconversions\u201d\nUse this parameter when launching a simple token currency. Together with \"currencies\", it can be used as a funding mechanism for the rootID. It\u2019s for the preconversion price. So when doing \"conversions\":[0.1], it means that for every VRSC the preconverter receives 10 CURRENCY after launch. The converted VRSC goes into the rootID.\nPeople can preconvert to this currency within the preconversion time frame. Define a \"startblock\", or let the default and minimum time frame play out, which is 20 blocks.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"CoolBrand\",\n \"options\":32,\n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\n \"conversions\":[0.1],\n \"minpreconversion\":[1000]\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This simple token currency is called CoolBrand. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 1000 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 10.000 CoolBrand. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds back.\n\u201cminpreconversion\u201d\nUse this parameter to set a minimum amount of preconversions. The minimum amount of preconversions needs to be met or the currency will not launch and everyone gets their conversions returned, minus the transaction and conversion fees. It works both with basket currencies and simple token currencies.\nThere is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting. Take this into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"CompanyX\",\n \"options\":32,\n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\n \"conversions\":[2],\n \"minpreconversion\":[500]\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This simple token currency is called CompanyX. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 250 CompanyX. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their fun",
