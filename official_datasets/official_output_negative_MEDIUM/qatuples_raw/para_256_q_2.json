    "What is the main purpose of burning fractional currencies on Verus, and how does it benefit the ecosystem?",
    "Burning fractional currencies on Verus is not the main purpose. Instead, burning some of that currency creates a license, and the value of the burned currency is returned to all holders. This process is part of the mutualization of value via Proof of Burn, which allows for the creation of licenses while distributing the value back to the holders of the currency.",
    "Privacy Woven In\nVRSC and by extension, all PBaaS native currencies, whether or not they are fractional, will be able to support zk-SNARKs on native transactions. zk-SNARKs are anticipated to serve as ways to publish and exchange provable, partially or wholly private data and receive messages, paid or otherwise, on the blockchain as well.\n2. Self-Rebalancing Liquidity Pool / Basket\nYet another use for the multi-currency reserve tokens is as a self-rebalancing liquidity pool and basket. When holding baskets on Verus, investments automatically adjust regardless of price movements.\nThis allows for hedging and the ability to profit in the long-term because these holders will receive implied volatility fees for providing liquidity. When using it as a trading mechanism and liquidity pool, traders can capitalize on the arbitrage opportunities created by the price differentials and fluctuations of the rebalancing pools.\nOther automated market makers and systems provide similar rebalancing liquidity pools however, today\u2019s solutions are subject to losses through front running, and without dynamic fees based on volatility, typically charge high fees as a default (compare Uniswap\u2019s 0.3% fee to Verus\u2019 0.025% base fee), often extracting profit from those fees over and above what goes to liquidity providers, miners, and stakers; these baskets provide a fully decentralized way to use these pools that gives all value back to the participants.1. Mutualization of Value via Proof of Burn\nBy using fractional currencies, combined with the ability to \u201cburn\u201d some of that currency to create a license while returning the value of that burned currency to all holders",
