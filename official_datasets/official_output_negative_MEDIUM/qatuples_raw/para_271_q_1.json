    "Can you explain why Verus is focusing on building a social media platform as its first application?",
    "Verus is not focusing on building a social media platform as its first application. The text doesn't mention anything about social media. Instead, it mentions that payment, privacy, and identity protocols are already implemented on the mainnet, and Defi is operational on the testnet, with more protocols to follow. These protocols are meant to serve as public infrastructure for various applications, but there is no specific mention of social media.",
    "s and then application systems are built around that, communicating through data. Verus has currently implemented payment, privacy and identity on its mainnet. Defi at the protocol level is in operation on testnet. Interoperability and blockchain creation is joining on testnet shortly, with data exchange to follow shortly thereafter.\nOnce these protocols are in place to serve as public infrastructure, Verus expects rapid uptake for users and developers of all kinds to continue building and using the applications of the new era.\nDiscuss and explore on Discord\nFollow us on Twitter\nGo to our website",
