    "What is the main reason for the loss of billions of dollars of value in the crypto space, according to your understanding?\n\n**ANSWER:`\nThe main reason for the loss of billions of dollars of value in the crypto space is not due to the lack of marketing or hype, as you implied. According to the text, the losses are primarily due to poor design and implementation of cross-chain bridges, bugs in complex smart contract workflows, stolen or compromised private keys, and outright theft by contract controllers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nIs Verus a protocol that was created by VCs and centralized exits to further exploit naive early users?",
    "No, Verus was not created by VCs and centralized exits to further exploit naive early users. According to the text, Verus was founded by technology veterans and others who believe humanity can do better than being exploited by the technology they had been building for corporations over decades. The Verus PBaaS protocol was designed to provide a more secure and decentralized solution to the problems plaguing the crypto space.",
    "Bitcoin with sustainable, decentralized, more secure primitives and better protocol design, billions of dollars of value has been lost or transferred from naive early users who bought into the pumped crypto hype to hackers, scammers, VCs, centralized exits, and MEV-exploiters who all leveraged the mass of weaknesses they either failed to protect against or in some cases created and obscured themselves on systems that don\u2019t define or enforce even the most common core primitives, currencies or identities. A great deal of loss has been due to obviously poor cross-chain \u201cbridge\u201d design, with the most common problem being bugs in complex smart contract workflow, followed by stolen or compromised private keys of contract owners / controllers, and in some cases, outright theft by contract controllers.\nThe lack of agreement on basic primitives and how to represent them in a globally resolvable way has held back general, robust solutions to the fundamental problem of interoperability between blockchains and other financial networks today. To complicate our collective challenges, adding full primitive support in the protocols is hard work, especially in an industry where just a year of development is considered a massive investment that must be rewarded by timely exit liquidity. Consequently, an abundance of shortcuts and heavily marketed yet hastily built solutions still dominate the popular narrative, as hacks, rugpulls, and losses continue to pile up.\nThe solution\nVerus was founded by technology veterans and others who believe humanity can do better than being exploited by the technology these same veterans had been building for corporations over decades. The Verus PBaaS protocol was designed, built, and tested over more than 5 years by a self-selected and often volunteer group of technology, finance, legal, operations, or just life veterans and newbies alike.
