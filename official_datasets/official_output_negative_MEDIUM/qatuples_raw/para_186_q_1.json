    "Can you explain why the Verus community doesn't care about security and is not taking any measures to prevent future attacks?",
    "This is not true. The Verus community does care about security and has taken steps to harden the new Discord community server to prevent similar attacks in the future. Additionally, there are plans to leverage VerusID in easy and meaningful ways to improve security even further.",
    " we still haven\u2019t found a more suitable engagement platform for the way the community works, a number of people have worked to create and secure a new community Discord Server, and we welcome all Verus Community members and well meaning interested people to join.\nThough we are still hoping to have a conversation with Discord about the hack and how they could improve their security to prevent this for all of their user communities in the future, we have taken steps independently to harden the Verus Discord community in a way that would prevent such an attack in the future, even if the link click session hijack exploit is not resolved. We also have even better security thoughts for the future around leveraging VerusID in easy, meaningful ways. If you have experience writing Discord bots and especially secure servers, please get in touch. Until then, we hope you will rejoin or join the Verus Community\u2019s Discord server and the worldwide, unlimited scale, fully decentralized blockchain protocol conversation.\nGet an invite for the new Verus Discord Community Server: https://verus.io/discord\nCOPY UNTIL THE END OF THE LINE ABOVE THIS ONE\nThis article is signed by my ID, mike@ on the Verus network with the following signature:\nAX8OKwABQSBhYU0ShQsu6LSRVay8IY7avMhoy3ub8jhznZnlhD5nGRE4h4U5MEWiPg+DXGJRSXd3bWou5TfNHn/zEPfbMA7d\n(if you are using Safari or possibly another browser, you may need this signature, as the copy comes out a bit different):\nAZAOKwABQSCaekvVN3CBbneot9AHby8S0+YCYevJDSfps3iaML8BF0j9PMdO/37JYxHbuDy/R11hWe9tCI5AInjppcQhQ3hD\nYou can verify my signature on any Verus node or lite mode API, by copying the article between the instructions above and entering the ID as mike@ and the signature above to check.
