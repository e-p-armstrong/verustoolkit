    "Do Verus DeFi transactions require the use of limit orders to convert between currencies?",
    "No, Verus DeFi transactions do not currently require the use of limit orders to convert between currencies. Instead, users can simply send to themselves, electing to convert from a particular token to another token via a multi-reserve currency that contains both tokens as reserves.",
    "dity baskets and balanced investments across multiple currencies is one way to use the Verus DeFi protocols, fractional currencies do not need to be 100% backed. While beyond the scope of this article, currencies that are not 100% backed have market prices that are decoupled from their underlying reserve basket, providing seamless liquidity to and from its basket currencies, earning fees between them, yet providing investment value that may far exceed a function of the currencies held in reserve as well.\nEase of Use, Low Transactions Costs and Scalability\nVerus DeFi is conducted by normal \u201csend transactions\u201d using its sendcurrency API (or the GUI in the wallet). To convert from one currency into another, a user simply sends to themselves, electing to convert from a particular token to another token via a multi-reserve currency that contains both tokens as reserves. There are no limit orders currently implemented in Verus, as it is expected that robust pairs will have low slippage and fair, market rates. In less robust multi-reserves, users will have to take care that they do not transact in excessive volumes in order to guard against prices moving sharply in an undesired direction.\nVerus is also in the process of implementing multi-chain capabilities with independent blockchains that are interoperable such that a particular token can exist on more than one chain. When work on a new chain requires a transaction fee, it can be paid in either an existing or new token, as appropriate. This leads to practically unlimited scalability since multi-reserves and tokens that are \u201cpopular\u201d do not lead to chain congestion or transaction fee competition. Accordingly, transaction fees will always remain at a de minimis level.\nEase of use also operates at the level of liquidity \u201cpool creation\u201d, making pool creation possible for all types of users. No programming is required to define",
