    "How do developers need to use centralized server-side APIs and VM-based smart contracts to build applications on the Verus network?",
    "That's not correct. The Verus network is a fully decentralized Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 0 (L0) protocol that allows developers to build applications without the need for centralized server-side APIs and VM-based smart contracts. Instead, developers can access the Verus network directly from their client-side applications using QR-codes, deep-links, and data-indexed blockchain nodes, giving them full control over their application data.",
    "p-Development Opportunities at Consensus 2024\nGet ready for a new era of decentralized application development. Unlike today\u2019s complex smart contract applications, requiring VM-based smart contracts that talk to user facing applications through server-side APIs and phishing-prone web-interfaces using public key hashes or rented names as identity, the Verus network is a Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 0 (L0) protocol with composable and powerful multi-chain core primitives, including identities, currencies, MEV-resistant liquidity baskets, updateable, even transferable ID-bound databases that can comprise NFTs and real world assets, all on a 100% fully decentralized, unlimited scale backbone, secured by the 50% proof-of-stake / 50% proof-of-work, 51% hash attack resistant Verus Proof of Power (PoP) consensus and accessible securely from mobile clients or cloud-based web-applications.\nBuild applications in your favorite framework for clients and access the Verus network either through QR-codes and deep-links to a client-side wallet under user control or talk directly to data-indexed, blockchain nodes, capable of providing fast access to an unlimited number of user identities and their unlimited Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF) indexable key-value database providing provable, optionally private, worldwide resolvable data at unlimited scale over an unlimited number of blockchains. All of this power, including inherent eCommerce and markets of all types are usable by applications, and unlike yesterday\u2019s Internet, application-owned data stays under application control, while user-owned data remains under user control and subject to voluntary, provable disclosure, protected by zero knowledge privacy, as it should always have been.\nWrite applications your way, your client frameworks, your languages, with links and RPC calls to the decentralized Internet of Value. Connect through one ",
