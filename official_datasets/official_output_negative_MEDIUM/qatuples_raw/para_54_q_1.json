    "What is the point of the Stake Guard system if it's just going to let cheaters get away with their illegitimate rewards?",
    "The Stake Guard system is actually designed to prevent cheaters from getting away with their illegitimate rewards. When a cheat is detected, the Stake Guard system allows anyone to claim the cheater's reward, effectively taking it away from the cheater. This means that cheaters no longer have an incentive to cheat, as they will not be able to enjoy the benefits of their illegitimate actions.",
    "at transaction is indeed a cheat, the spend of the cheaters stake reward at the time of the cheat, is signed using the Stake Guard\u2019s key and spent to the shielded address provided by the person who claimed the cheater\u2019s reward. The wallet of the person who found the cheat reward is paid the block reward and it disappears from the cheater\u2019s wallet.\nDecentralized Anti-Cheat Staking\nAs mentioned above, for legitimate stakers the Stake Guard CC will function normally, signing the coinbase reward transaction when they spend it with their own Public Key\u2026all in the background and at the blockchain level.\nIf, however, the 1 of 2 evaluation sees the public key of the person trying to spend it doesn\u2019t match that of the original staker it simply verifies the person trying to take the free money from the cheater has proven that this is indeed a cheated transaction which they discovered and if so, will let them take it.\nThis can be done by anyone who knows how to pack up the data after scanning and finding cheat attempt staking transactions\u2026but will also be implemented into the mining software by Verus to perform the attempted spend of the cheaters reward block when mining at the block where that cheat reward matures.\nNo Incentive to Cheat\nThe cheaters one single legitimate reward block out of the two attempts they made to double spend, is no longer locked in to be spent by them alone. Anyone can now spend this by simply proving to the Stake Guard CC the verified cheat transaction hash in an OP_RETURN.\nSo, while even the cheater can try to run and grab it with the rest of the network, or try to spend it before anyone else, now the odds are stacked against them\u2026and why even cheat? Afterall, there is no double spend available due to the fundamental way in which the blockchain is modified with this Stake Guard.\nIt simply makes no sense, using the same logic PoW uses, decentralizing t",
