    "How did the company behind the FPGA bitstream and secret mining community work with the Verus Coin community to develop open source FPGA mining software?",
    "Actually, the company behind the FPGA bitstream and secret mining community did not come to an agreement with the Verus Coin community to work together on open source FPGA mining software. As a result, the Verus team made the decision to fork to a newly developed algorithm, VerusHash 2.0.",
    "d design but, unlike an ASIC, is re-programmable. It requires advanced development of mining algorithms, which are released as \u201cbitstreams\u201d, used to flash the memory of the FPGA to the latest algorithm of the target coin(s).\nVerus community member Seth David (aka Godballz on Discord) just published a very informative and interesting article discussing FPGAs and other specialized hardware in more depth. You can read his post here.\nVerus lead developer Mike Toutonghi reached out to the company behind the FPGA bitstream and secret mining community, in an effort to work together for the betterment of open source FPGA mining software which could work well with the new VerusHash algorithm, which he was designing to bring equalization between hardware types.\nAlthough the company did not come to an agreement with the Verus Coin community, Verus made the decision to fork to a newly developed algorithm. In under 3 weeks, the update was released, and the fork was set for December 28 at block height 310,000 on the Verus blockchain.\nVerusHash 2.0 Design\nWhile this new algorithm was only mineable by CPU hardware in the first week, with GPUs to soon follow, the lead developer of Verus Coin, Mike Toutonghi worked closely with the primary community GPU dev to help ensure that GPUs had the best chance possible to mine effectively on the new algorithm as well.\n\u201cI believe in progress. Progress of hardware, software, AND algorithms. We are doing this to create an algorithm that doesn\u2019t favor one type of hardware over another, but helps ensure that proof of work measurement is economically comparable across as many types of hardware and with a total of the broadest distribution possible.\u201d \u2014 Mike Toutonghi\nEarly, unoptimized reports, reveal a likely optimized GPU performance level that could range from the low to the middle-high range of CPU price/performance, landing solidly on the low end",
