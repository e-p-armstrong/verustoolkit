    "No, the Verus protocol is not yet live on mainnet. According to the latest updates, the first release candidate (RC1) is currently live on testnet, allowing anyone to launch blockchains and currencies, including DeFi at the protocol layer and a non-custodial Eth-bridge. The protocol developers are still working on getting everything ready for mainnet, including adding an additional security mechanism for chain notarizations.",
