    "How does Verus handle scalability issues, given that it's a centralized system?",
    "Verus is not a centralized system. In fact, it's a decentralized financial network that can scale out as needed to meet various requirements, whether they're for centralized corporate, open government, or fully decentralized applications.",
    "ges of today can be naturally solved by scaling-out as needed, whether requirements call for centralized corporate, open government, or fully decentralized applications. In addition to this new solution, disruptive even among modern blockchains, the open, community-driven model enables Verus to be the first and only credibly neutral, rent-free, decentralized financial network.",
