    \ and multi-currency blockchain protocol. Given some text from an informational\
    \ website about Verus, the Verus coin, or other related Verus community projects,\
    \ and a question based on the text, you will make a determination as to whether\
    \ the question tests ONLY information in the text. Essentially: you will check\
    \ if the question is answerable, given the information in the paragraphs. Your\
    \ task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not the\
    \ question reflects aspects of the paragraphs provided.\n\nThe specific questions\
    \ you are analyzing are adversarial -- they are inconsistent with the information\
    \ in the text, and the answer's job is to correct the question and then provide\
    \ an adequate answer based off of the provided information. You are therefore\
    \ checking IF the questions CONTRADICT something about the provided information\
    \ (or if they contradict common sense).\n\nFollowing your analysis, at the very\
    \ end of your response \u2014 in your \"final judgment\" or \"final answer\" \u2014\
    \ you will write \"RELEVANT\" or \"IRRELEVANT\" depending on your analysis of\
    \ the question with regards to the text.\n\nNote a special exception: if a question\
    \ includes information that isn't in the paragraphs, but is clearly (DIRECTLY,\
    \ not implicitly or implied) mentioned by the paragraphs as having been covered\
    \ earlier, then that question is relevant. Essentially: questions are allowed\
    \ to cover content that the text has explicitly covered in the past.\n\n**So in\
    \ summary:**\n\n* You will analyze the question step-by-step, ensuring each part\
    \ of the question is individually compared to the text.\n* The key steps are:\n\
    \  * analyzing the text\n  * understanding the (flawed) question\n  * systematically\
    \ comparing each part of the question with the text\n  * determining whether this\
    \ adversarial question is related to the text\n* The deliberately-flawed question\
    \ must have an actual flaw to be relevant -- it can't just be flawed because it\
    \ asks about something the text doesn't cover. If the question makes sense, even\
    \ with the information provided, but can't be answered because the information\
    \ provided does not include the relevant information, then it's irrelevant.\n\
    * This process continues until either a part of the question is found not to be\
    \ covered by the text, leading to a judgment of \"IRRELEVANT,\" or until all parts\
    \ of the question have been compared and found to be covered by the text, leading\
    \ to a judgment of \"RELEVANT.\"\n* This method allows for a thorough and detailed\
    \ assessment, ensuring that the final judgment accurately reflects the extent\
    \ to which the question is based on the given text.\n* Keep in mind that the provided\
    \ text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around this.\n\nPlease now apply this\
    \ method to the provided text and question, and write out your reasoning and thought\

    ### In-Depth Analysis of the Text:

    #### Content and Depth: The text details a solution to a dependency issue that
    may come up when running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution. It describes that
    the libraries `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` may not be installed by default, and
    provides a `sudo apt-get install` command to install them.

    #### Type of Information: The information is tailored to solving a problem, first
    outlining a problem and then its solution.


    ### Detailed Understanding of the Question:

    #### Core Requirement: The question asks about how to install the libgomp.so.1
    and libz.so libraries.

    #### Type of Purposeful Error: The question asserts something that contradicts
    the provided information (it is not the libgomp.so.1 and libz.so libraries that
    must be installed, but the `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries).

    #### Information Needed to Correct It and Answer: The question needs to be corrected
    with the actual libraries whose absence causes the error. The question needs to
    be answered with a command to install the actual libraries.


    ### Targeted Comparison of the Question with the Text:

    #### Content Match: The text contains the names of the libraries that need to
    be installed, as well as the command for installing them.

    #### Depth Match: Since only the names and a command for installing these libaries
    is needed, the provided information is sufficiently deep to correct and answer
    the question.


    ### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:

    The text contains enough information to correct, and then answer, the question
    with sufficient detail. This makes it: RELEVANT.'

    # What versions of OSX/macOS are supported?


    ## Verus Desktop


    Currently only macOS 10.12.x and up are tested and supported for Verus Desktop.
    Installing Verus Desktop on OSX 10.11.x or earlier may be possible but the wallet
    does not function and never completes the initial sync.


    ## Verus CLI wallet


    The CLI wallet should run on lower versions without problems.


    ## File location


    `VRSC Wallet and Data location` on Mac OS: `/Users//Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`


    ### Necessary files:


    Link 1: [How-To install the latest Wallet](#!/how-to/how-to_bootstrap.md)


    ## Procedure:


    If you installed on OSX 10.11.x or earlier and need to remove it:


    1. Quit your Wallet.

    2. Eject the wallet dmg.

    3. Make a backup of `wallet.dat` & `VRSC.conf` if necessary (Only if you had a
    wallet on this machine or if you used an existing `wallet.dat`)

    4. If you installed the `Agama.app` in Applications, move this to the trash.

    5. Move `~/Library/Application Support/Agama` to the trash or use the following
    command in terminal

    `rmdir /Users//Library/Application\\ Support/Agama`.

    6. Move `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo` to the trash or use the following
    command in terminal

    `rmdir /Users//Library/Application\\ Support/Komodo`.

    7. Upgrade OS.

    8. Install Agama (Check `Link1` for a smooth install)

    ### In-Depth Analysis of the Text:

    #### Content and Depth: The text is part of an FAQ about the Verus Desktop and
    Verus Wallet. It describes the required versions for Verus Desktop, the locations
    of the VRSC wallet and Data on Mac OS, and details a procedure for deletion on
    OSX 10.11.x.

    #### Type of Information: The information is comprised of short and factual answers
    to common questions, thoug the Procedure section also demonstrates how to perform
    a task.


    ### Detailed Understanding of the Question:

    #### Core Requirement: The question asks about where the wallet and data files
    are located on a Windows PC.

    ### Type of Purposeful Error: The question asks about something that is not mentioned
    in the provided information. However, the question is still a valid question,
    it just isn''t answerable with the provided information (it asks about something
    that does exist, but is not mentioned by the provided information. Therefore,
    it has the rong kind of flaw, and should be rejected).

    #### Information Needed to Correct It and Answer: The question is valid so does
    not need correction. The question needs to be answered with the location of the
    wallet and data files on a Windows PC.


    ### Targeted Comparison of the Question with the Text:

    #### Content Match: The text contains the location of the wallet and data files
    on Mac OS, but not on Windows.

    #### Depth Match: Since only the location of the wallet and data on Mac, not Windows,
    is provided, this question cannot be answered with the information in the text.
    Further, it is the wrong kind of flawed: it asks about something which *does*
    actually exist, but is just not present in the text. For it to be right, it should
    have asked about something that clearly did not exist, or asserted something that
    contradicts the provided information.


    ### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:

    The text does not contain the information needed to answer the question, and the
    question is the wrong kind of flawed. This makes it: IRRELEVANT.'
