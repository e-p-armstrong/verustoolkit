            "The Verus DeFi protocol addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular basket currency and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities.",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees.The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.## Interoperable, multichain network The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.",
