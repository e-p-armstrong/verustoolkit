            "Verus Proof of Power (VerusPoP) is a hybrid consensus algorithm that combines Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate each block. It uses a statistical function to determine whether a block is validated by PoW or PoS, with a target percentage of 50% of blocks validated by each form of proof. This means that 50% of all blocks are validated by miners (PoW) and the other 50% are validated by stakers (PoS).",

            "VerusPoP is resistant to attacks because it requires more than 50% of the validation power, known as \"Chain Power\", to successfully attack the Verus blockchain. This means that an attacker would need to control over 50% of both the chain's hashpower and its coin supply, making it a highly secure and decentralized network.",
