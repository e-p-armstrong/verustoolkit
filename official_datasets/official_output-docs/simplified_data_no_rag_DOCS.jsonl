What is the namespace required to launch a currency on Verus, and what is its significance?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "The namespace required to launch a currency on Verus is a VerusID, which is the name of the currency (e.g. ``MyBrand@``). This namespace can also have subIDs (e.g. ``product.MyBrand@``, ``user.MyBrand@``). The controller of this VerusID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.

What are some of the features and capabilities of a VerusID?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Some of the features and capabilities of a VerusID include holding funds, being a personal profile, corporate website, or government portal, being revoked and recovered, setting time locks, being controlled by any number of identities, signing and verifying data, files, and messages, having privacy through added z-addresses, sending and receiving messages, and communicating in standardized ways through the Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF). That's quite a list, isn't it?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Definitely. What is the significance of a VerusID in creating PBaaS-chains, tokens, and currencies on the Verus blockchain?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "A VerusID is necessary to create PBaaS-chains, tokens, and currencies on the Verus blockchain.
