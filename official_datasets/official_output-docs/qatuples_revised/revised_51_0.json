    "What is the purpose of the `options` parameter when defining a PBaaS blockchain, and how do I use it?",
    "The `options` parameter is used to customize the behavior of your PBaaS blockchain by combining various options. These options define different use cases for your blockchain, such as allowing fractional reserve conversions, enabling ID staking, or setting up a token-based system. You can combine these options by adding their corresponding values together in the `options` parameter.",
