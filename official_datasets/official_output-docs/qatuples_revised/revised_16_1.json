    "What is the benefit of launching a currency or token through a decentralized crowdfund mechanism on Verus?",
    "Launching a currency or token through a decentralized crowdfund mechanism on Verus allows for worldwide participation and provides a range of customizable launch options. If the minimum participation levels are not met by the start time of the currency or token, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their preconversions, less network fees. This mechanism also allows for setting maximum participation levels, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations, carve-outs of proceeds, and vesting schedules.",
    "Any currency and token, on Verus or any other PBaaS-blockchain, can be exported to Ethereum as an ERC-20. They can then be used in the Ethereum ecosystem. Also, any already existing ERC-20 token can be mapped one-to-one as a Verus currency. Meaning any ERC-20 token can live on the Verus blockchain (or any other PBaaS-chain) and take advantage of all the L1 features. ## Crowdfund mechanisms All currencies can be launched through decentralized crowdfund mechanisms. [Set required minimum levels](/currencies/launch-currency.html#minpreconversion) of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies. If by the start time of your currency or token, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their preconversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral [pre-allocations](launch-currency.html#preallocations) to select VerusIDs that increase the reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral [carve-outs of proceeds](launch-currency.html#prelaunchcarveout), and [pre-launch discounts](launch-currency.html#prelaunchdiscount) for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well. #",
