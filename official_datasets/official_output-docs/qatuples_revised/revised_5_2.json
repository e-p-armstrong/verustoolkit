    "Yes, there are other possible configurations for a multisig VerusID, such as 13 of 13 signatures, 1 of 25 signatures, and 1 of 1 signature, among others.",
    "# Set up multisig for VerusID With multisig, you can set up a wallet that requires multiple signatures to send a transaction. For example, you could set up a wallet that requires two out of three possible signatures before a transaction can be sent. A multisig VerusID can be up to **13 of 25 signatures**. It can also be 13 of 13; 1 of 25; and of course 1 of 1.",
