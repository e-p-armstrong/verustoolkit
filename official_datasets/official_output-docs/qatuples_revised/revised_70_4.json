    "How was the initial supply of Bridge.vETH distributed?",
    "Bridge.vETH had an initial supply of 100,000. During the preconversion timeframe which lasted 10 days, anyone could add VRSC, ETH, DAI, and MKR into its reserves. When the preconversion period ended, everyone got their share of the 100,000 Bridge.vETH, distributed by the protocol.",
    "The notary witnesses are also monitoring notarizations, and if they were to sign for something that they themselves do not agree with, they can auto-revoke their identities, using the VerusID protocol, which cannot be stopped by an attacker unless they have stolen both the keys for the notary ID and those for its revocation ID as well. This serves as a prevention for stolen key attacks, ensuring that notaries are extremely hard targets to compromise.## Bridge.vETH currency Bridge.vETH is a 100% backed currency with 4 currencies in its reserves (VRSC, ETH, DAI, MKR), [read more on basket currencies](/currencies/). The Bridge.vETH currency function is to make the bridging of assets simple. From wherever side on the bridge you send it converts the fees that you need seamlessly.The value of Bridge.vETH increases relative to reserves when fees or interest are added to the reserves without there being new Bridge.vETH minted.| \ud83d\udcc8 Accrued fees       |     Details      | | :------------------ | :----------------------------------------- | | [**Dai Savings Rate**](https://blog.makerdao.com/an-update-on-the-dai-savings-rate-in-multi-collateral-dai/)| 5% interest (at the time of writing, the rate is subject to change by MakerDAO) is earned automatically when holding Dai in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. Dai in Bridge.vETH and in the complete Verus ecosystem get this savings rate. The DSR is being passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH.| | **.vETH subID registrations**| A .vETH subID costs 0.01 vETH worth of Bridge.vETH. When registering the subID the Bridge.vETH is burned, meaning the Bridge.vETH supply decreases. | | **Conversion fees**| 50% of the conversion fees go into the reserves of Bridge.vETH: 0.025% when it's a reserve to reserve conversion, 0.0125% when it's a reserve to Bridge.vETH conversion (or vice versa). | | **Cross-chain send fees**| A share of the cross-chain send fees go into the reserves of Bridge.vETH. |Bridge.vETH had an initial supply of 100,000.
