    "What is a \"Basket currency\" in Verus?",
    "A \"Basket currency\" is a type of currency in Verus that has reserves and can be converted to and from those reserves. It can have one currency as its reserve or multiple currencies, up to a maximum of 10. This type of currency can be launched in a centralized or decentralized manner.",
    "| Options # | Details | | -: |:-----| | 1 | The currency has reserves, and can be converted to and from the reserves (option 32 needs to be added). Can have one currency as its reserves, or multiple with up to 10 currencies. This is a \u201cBasket currency\u201d \u2014 a currency with a basket of reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized. | | 2 | Only the controlling VerusID (the namespace of the currency, the rootID) can create subIDs. | | 8 | Referrals and discounts are enabled for subID creation. | | 16 | Referrals are required for subID creation. | | 32 | The currency is a simple token currency without any reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized. This option is also used for [Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens](/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth). | | 2048 | A single satoshi (0.00000001) NFT token is created & has tokenized control of the root VerusID. Which means you can send the single satoshi token to other addresses and then they have control of the root VerusID. |Let\u2019s give some examples of combined options: - ``\"options\":33`` \u2014 this launches a basket currency. It is options 1 + 32 combined. - ``\"options\":2080`` \u2014 this launches a single satoshi token that has control of the root VerusID. It is options 32 + 2048 combined. - ``\"options\":35`` \u2014 this launches a basket currency, and only the rootID can create subIDs. It is options 1 + 2 + 32 combined.## Defining parameters Next up are the parameters. Choose the parameters wisely to launch a currency that suits any need. Not all parameters are needed or combinable. There are many to go through, so let\u2019s start.### **\"proofprotocol\"** This parameter defines, among others, if the currency is centralized or decentralized. You can choose 1,2 or 3.``1`` is default, which launches a decentralized currency (no need to include this parameter when defining such a currency). When subIDs are created with this option, the registration fees are burned.``2`` is for a centralized currency. If it\u2019s a basket currency the rootID can mint and burn supply while automatically lowering and raising the reserve ratio (also anyone can burn supply without lowering the reserve ratio). Or when it\u2019s a simple token currency they can just mint and burn supply. The subID registration fees go to the rootID.``3`` is for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens.
