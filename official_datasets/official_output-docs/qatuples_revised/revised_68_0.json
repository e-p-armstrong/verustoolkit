    "How does the supply of Bridge.vETH change over time?",
    "The supply of Bridge.vETH is dynamic and changes when people convert other currencies to or from Bridge.vETH. When someone converts VRSC, ETH, DAI, or MKR to Bridge.vETH, the currency is minted, increasing the supply. Conversely, when someone converts from Bridge.vETH back to one of these currencies, the currency is burned, decreasing the supply.",
    "The supply of Bridge.vETH is dynamic. The currency gets minted when people convert VRSC, ETH, DAI or MKR to Bridge.vETH, and the currency gets burned when they convert from Bridge.vETH back to VRSC, ETH, DAI or MKR. Converting currencies using Bridge.vETH (or other basket currencies) has many advantages.
