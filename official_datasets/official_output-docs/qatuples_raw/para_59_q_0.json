    "What role do Notary IDs play in the Verus network?",
    "Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains.",
    "Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.",
