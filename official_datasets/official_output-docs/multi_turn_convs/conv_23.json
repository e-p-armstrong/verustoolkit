    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI have some questions about multisig VerusIDs. What is the maximum number of signatures that can be required for a multisig VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA multisig VerusID can require up to 13 out of 25 signatures to send a transaction. This provides an added layer of security and flexibility for managing your digital assets.\n\n**User:**\nAre there other possible configurations for a multisig VerusID besides 13 of 25 signatures?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are other possible configurations for a multisig VerusID. For example, you could have 13 of 13 signatures, 1 of 25 signatures, and 1 of 1 signature, among others. The flexibility of multisig VerusIDs allows you to tailor the configuration to your specific needs and use cases.",
