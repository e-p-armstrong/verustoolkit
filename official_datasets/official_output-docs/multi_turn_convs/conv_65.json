    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about notary witnesses and how they protect themselves. How do notary witnesses protect themselves from stolen key attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary witnesses can auto-revoke their identities using the VerusID protocol if they were to sign for something they don't agree with. This serves as a prevention for stolen key attacks, ensuring that notaries are extremely hard targets to compromise.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been wondering about Bridge.vETH. What is Bridge.vETH and what is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBridge.vETH is a 100% backed currency with 4 currencies in its reserves (VRSC, ETH, DAI, MKR). Its purpose is to make the bridging of assets simple by converting fees seamlessly from wherever side on the bridge you send it.\n\n**User:**\nSo, how does the value of Bridge.vETH change over time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe value of Bridge.vETH increases relative to reserves when fees or interest are added to the reserves without there being new Bridge.vETH minted.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What are some sources of accrued fees for Bridge.vETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome sources of accrued fees for Bridge.vETH include:\n\n1. Dai Savings Rate: 5% interest (at the time of writing, the rate is subject to change by MakerDAO) is earned automatically when holding Dai in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract.\n2..vETH subID registrations: A.vETH subID costs 0.01 vETH worth of Bridge.vETH, which is burned, decreasing the Bridge.vETH supply.\n3. Conversion fees: 50% of the conversion fees go into the reserves of Bridge.vETH.\n4. Cross-chain send fees: A share of the cross-chain send fees go into the reserves of Bridge.vETH.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, how was the initial supply of Bridge.vETH distributed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBridge.vETH had an initial supply of 100,000. During the preconversion timeframe which lasted 10 days, anyone could add VRSC, ETH, DAI, and MKR into its reserves. When the preconversion period ended, everyone got their share of the 100,000 Bridge.vETH, distributed by the protocol.",
