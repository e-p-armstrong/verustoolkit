    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been staking with Verus Desktop and I'd like to divert my staking rewards to a different wallet. Can you guide me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo divert your staking rewards to a different wallet, you'll need two devices: a staking device and a hot wallet device. On the hot wallet device, find the pubkey for the address you want your won stakes to arrive at by going to the Wallet tab, clicking \"receive\" under Transparent Balance, clicking the three-dots next to the address, and copying the public key.\n\nOn the staking device, go to Settings, select Profile Settings, and add two launch options: `minetolocalwallet=0` and `pubkey=<hot wallet pubkey>`. Save changes, close and reopen the wallet, and your stakes will now be diverted to your hot wallet.\n\nDo you have any questions about this process or would you like me to clarify something?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What's the purpose of the \"hot wallet\" in diverting staking rewards?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe hot wallet is the device where you want your staking rewards to arrive. You need to find the pubkey for the address on this device where you want to receive your won stakes. It's essentially where you want your staking rewards to be sent.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! And what if I forget to save changes after adding the launch options on my staking device?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you forget to save changes, the launch options will not be applied, and your staking rewards will not be diverted to your hot wallet. Make sure to click the \"Save Changes\" button to apply the changes.",

Let's explain how you can divert your won stakes to a different wallet with Verus Desktop. We have two devices with two different wallets: - Your staking device - Your hot wallet device ### Hot wallet The hot wallet is the device you want your stakes to arrive on. On the hot wallet we need to lookup the ``pubkey`` for the address you want your won stakes to arrive. Go to the ``Wallet-tab``, click ``receive`` under Transparent Balance. Then click the three-dots next to the address you want to use. Click ``Copy public key`` as seen in the image below. Paste and save this somewhere, we will need it later. ![image-pubkey](/images/copy-pubkey.png) ### Staking device This device is staking happily, and your funds are secured with the Vault ([read here how to set up](/guides/setup-vault/)). Let's make sure your won stakes are sent to your hot wallet device. Go to ``settings`` (the cogwheel top right corner), then select ``Profile Settings`` (default). Here you see the option ``Custom native mode launch options``. Select ``Verus``. First copy and paste the code from below into the textfield and click ``Add launch option``. ``` minetolocalwallet=0 ``` Next, copy and paste the code below. Change ``xxx`` to the ``public key`` we have from the hot wallet. Click ``Add launch option``. ``` pubkey=xxx ``` At last, click the ``Save Changes`` button. **Don't forget this step!** Now close the wallet and open it again.
