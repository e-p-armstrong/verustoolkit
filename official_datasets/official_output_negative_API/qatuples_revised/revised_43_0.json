    "What is the purpose of the `listreceivedbyaccount` command, and how can I use it to send Verus coins to another user?",
    "The `listreceivedbyaccount` command is not used to send Verus coins to another user. It is actually a deprecated command that lists the balances of accounts, showing the total amount received by addresses with each account. It does not have the capability to send coins.\n\nTo send Verus coins, you would need to use a different command, such as `sendtoaddress` or `sendmany`.",
