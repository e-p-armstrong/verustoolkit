    "Can you explain how to use the `getblockchaininfo` command to get the hash of the 100th block in the blockchain?",
    "The `getblockchaininfo` command does not provide the hash of a specific block in the blockchain. It returns an object containing various state info regarding block chain processing, including the hash of the currently best block (`bestblockhash`), but not the hash of a specific block number.",
