    "What is the purpose of the `z_importkey` command if I can already use `z_exportkey` to get the private key?",
    "The `z_importkey` command is not used to get the private key, but rather to import a private key that you already have. The `z_exportkey` command is used to export a private key from a zaddr, while the `z_importkey` command is used to import a private key into the system. They serve different purposes.",
    "z_exportkey \"zaddr\" (outputashex)\n\nReveals the zkey corresponding to 'zaddr'.\nThen the z_importkey can be used with this output\n\nArguments:\n1. \"zaddr\"  (string, required) The zaddr for the private key\n2. \"outputashex\" (boolean, optional, default=false) If true, output key data as hex bytes\n\nResult:\n\"key\"         (string) The private key\n\nExamples:\n> verus z_exportkey \"myaddress\"\n> verus z_importkey \"mykey\"\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_exportkey\", \"params\": [\"myaddress\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
