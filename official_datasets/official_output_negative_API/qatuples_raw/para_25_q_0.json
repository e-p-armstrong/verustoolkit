    "What is the purpose of the `getblockchaininfo` command, which returns a string containing the current block number?",
    "The `getblockchaininfo` command does not return a string containing the current block number. It returns an object containing various state info regarding block chain processing, including the current network type, network name, blockchain ID, number of blocks processed, headers validated, best block hash, difficulty, verification progress, chain work, size on disk, number of note commitments, and status of softforks in progress.",
