    "How does the `z_mergetoaddress` command handle errors when merging UTXOs and notes?",
    "If an error occurs during the merging process, the UTXOs selected for merging will be unlocked. You can use the `listlockunspent` RPC call to return a list of locked UTXOs.",
    "z_mergetoaddress [\"fromaddress\", ... ] \"toaddress\" ( fee ) ( transparent_limit ) ( shielded_limit ) ( memo )WARNING: z_mergetoaddress is disabled.\nTo enable it, restart zcashd with the -experimentalfeatures and\n-zmergetoaddress commandline options, or add these two lines\nto the zcash.conf file:experimentalfeatures=1\nzmergetoaddress=1Merge multiple UTXOs and notes into a single UTXO or note. Protected coinbase UTXOs are ignored, use `z_shieldcoinbase`\nto combine those into a single note.This is an asynchronous operation, and UTXOs selected for merging will be locked. If there is an error, they\nare unlocked. The RPC call `listlockunspent` can be used to return a list of locked UTXOs.The number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging can be limited by the caller. If the transparent limit\nparameter is set to zero, and Overwinter is not yet active, the -mempooltxinputlimit option will determine the\nnumber of UTXOs. After Overwinter has activated -mempooltxinputlimit is ignored and having a transparent\ninput limit of zero will mean limit the number of UTXOs based on the size of the transaction. Any limit is\nconstrained by the consensus rule defining a maximum transaction size of 100000 bytes before Sapling, and 2000000\nbytes once Sapling activates.",
