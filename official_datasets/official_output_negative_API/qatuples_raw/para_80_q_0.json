    "How do I use the `estimatepriority` command to estimate the fee needed for a transaction to be confirmed within a certain number of blocks?",
    "The `estimatepriority` command doesn't estimate the fee needed for a transaction. Instead, it estimates the approximate priority a zero-fee transaction needs to begin confirmation within a certain number of blocks. The command takes one argument, `nblocks`, which is the number of blocks within which you want the transaction to be confirmed.",
    "estimatepriority nblocks\n\nEstimates the approximate priority\na zero-fee transaction needs to begin confirmation\nwithin nblocks blocks.\n\nArguments:\n1. nblocks   (numeric)\n\nResult:\nn :  (numeric) estimated priority\n\n-1.0 is returned if not enough transactions and\nblocks have been observed to make an estimate.\n\nExample:\n> verus estimatepriority 6",
