    "The `invalidateblock` command is used to permanently mark a block as invalid, not to validate a block. It's used to mark a block as if it violated a consensus rule. To invalidate a block, you would use the command `invalidateblock \"hash\"` where \"hash\" is the hash of the block you want to mark as invalid.",
