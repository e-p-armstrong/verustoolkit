    "Can I set \"proofprotocol\" to 2 for a native currency?",
    "No, you cannot set \"proofprotocol\" to 2 for a native currency. PROOF_CHAINID (value 2) is only applicable to non-native currencies, and it allows for centralized control, minting, and burning of the currency, as well as changing weights. Native currencies have different rules and restrictions.",
