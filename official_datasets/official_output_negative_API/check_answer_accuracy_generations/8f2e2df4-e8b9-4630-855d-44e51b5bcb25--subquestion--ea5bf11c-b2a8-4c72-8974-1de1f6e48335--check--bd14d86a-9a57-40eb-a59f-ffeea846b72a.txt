    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\
    \ M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\nAdversarial Question (based on text):\n\"\"\"\n\
    Why are VerusIDs not quantum-resistant?\n\"\"\"\n\nSupposed answer to the question\
    \ (this is what you are fact-checking; it should correct the question): \n\"\"\
    \"\nVerusIDs are actually already quantum-resistant \u2014 they are quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto addresses. The phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\"\
    \ refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers that\
    \ use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure signature scheme\
    \ for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have all the funds\
    \ sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant.\n\nSo with regard to your\
    \ question, it seems there's some confusion, as VerusIDs are, in fact, quantum-resistant.\n\

    \ Key Information: The text outlines and describes in decent detail what VerusIDs\

    \ Categorize Information Type: The information is descriptive/educational, teaching\
    \ people a concept related to Verus and the Verus ecosystem.\n\n### Answer Breakdown:\n\
    **Dissect the Answer's Assertions:**\n  * That VerusIDs are already quantum-resistant.\n\
    \  * That \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\" refers to the resistance\
    \ of VerusIDs against quantum attack with existing algorithms.\n  * That a quantum-secure\

    \ resistant (through the changing of an ID)\n  * That quantum computers have the\
    \ potential to break cryptographic algorithms.\n  * That being \"quantum-ready\"\
    \ refers to being resistant to attack by quantum computers using known algorithms\
    \ (once such computers are invented).\n  * That VerusIDs may publish ID to destination\

    \ Accuracy and Common Knowledge Check:**\n\n  * The text describes VerusIDs as\
    \ being quantum-resistant (though transactions do not have a quantum secure signature\
    \ scheme)\n  * The text describes \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\"\
    \ as referring to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers\
    \ (using existing algorithms). This aligns with the answer's assertion.\n  * The\
    \ text describes quantum-secure signature schemes as allowing funds to be made\
    \ retroactively quantum-resistant.\n  * The text does not mention anything about\
    \ quantum computers having the potential to break cryptographic algorithms, but\
    \ this is common knowledge.\n  * The text does not mention what \"quantum-ready\"\
    \ means explicitly, but this is easily-inferrable from the text and the words\
    \ themselves.\n  * The text explicitly describes how VerusIDs are capable of publishing\
    \ ID to destination mappings on other blockchains.\n  * The question asserts that\
    \ VerusIDs are not quantum-resistant, which is flawed.\n\n### Final Judgment:\n\
    #### Comprehensive Assessment: The answer's claims that are related to the text\
    \ are corroborated by the text itself. Everything else lines up with common knowledge.\n\
