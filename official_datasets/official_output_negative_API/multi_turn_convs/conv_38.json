    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to figure out how to use the `prioritisetransaction` command to pay a higher fee for a transaction. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I have to correct you - the `prioritisetransaction` command doesn't actually pay a higher fee for a transaction. It only adjusts the priority of the transaction in the algorithm for selecting transactions into a block, making it seem like the transaction has a higher fee. The fee delta argument is used to simulate a higher (or lower) fee, but the actual fee is not changed.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what's the default priority delta value when using the `prioritisetransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is no default priority delta value when using the `prioritisetransaction` command. The priority delta argument is required and must be specified when using the command.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. One more question - can I use the `prioritisetransaction` command to change the transaction id of a transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `prioritisetransaction` command is used to adjust the priority of a transaction, not to change its transaction id. The transaction id is specified as an argument to the command, and it is used to identify the transaction whose priority is being adjusted.",
