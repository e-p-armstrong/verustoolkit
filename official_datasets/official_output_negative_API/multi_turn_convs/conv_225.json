    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about the `coinsupply` command. Can you explain how to use it without specifying a block height?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `coinsupply` command can be used without specifying a block height, in which case it will default to the current block height. So, you can simply run the command without adding a block height parameter, and it will give you the current coin supply.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I've got another question about the `coinsupply` command. Does it only work with the `VRSC` currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `coinsupply` command is not limited to the `VRSC` currency. The `coin` field in the response simply indicates the currency symbol of the native coin of the blockchain being queried, which in this case happens to be `VRSC`. So, you can use the `coinsupply` command with other currencies as well, not just `VRSC`. Do you have any more questions about the `coinsupply` command or Verus in general?",
