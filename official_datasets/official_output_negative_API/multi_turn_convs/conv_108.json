    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm having some trouble using the `getidentitieswithrevocation` method. Can you help me understand how to use it to get all identities that have been revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I need to correct your assumption. The `getidentitieswithrevocation` method doesn't actually return revoked identities. Instead, it returns all identities where the specified `identityid` or i-address is the revocation authority. This means it returns identities that can revoke other identities, not the ones that have been revoked.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. That makes sense. Thanks for the clarification. I also had a question about the `unspent` parameter in the `getidentitieswithrevocation` method. What's the default value for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default value of the `unspent` parameter is `false`, not `true`. This means that by default, the method will return all matching identities, not just the active ones.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And one more question. Can I use the `getidentitieswithrevocation` method to get identities that have been modified before a certain block height?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getidentitieswithrevocation` method can be used to get identities that have been modified from a certain block height forward, not before. The `fromheight` parameter specifies the block height from which to start searching for modified identities.",
