    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a question about using Verus. What is the purpose of the `z_importwallet` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. There is no `z_importwallet` command in Verus. The command you're looking for is actually `z_exportwallet`. This command exports all wallet keys, for taddr and zaddr, in a human-readable format. It takes two arguments: the filename to save the wallet keys to, and an optional boolean flag to export only addresses with indexed UTXOs or that control IDs in the wallet. Does that help clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the correction! I was mistaken about the command. But, I do have a follow-up question. What happens if I try to export my wallet keys to a file that already exists?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you try to export your wallet keys to a file that already exists, the `z_exportwallet` command will not overwrite the existing file. Instead, it will prevent the overwrite and return an error. This is a safety feature to prevent accidental overwriting of important files. You'll need to specify a new filename or remove the existing file before exporting your wallet keys.",
