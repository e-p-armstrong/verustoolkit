    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to generate a new wallet passphrase. I heard that the `convertpassphrase` command can be used to do that. Can you show me how?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a common misconception. The `convertpassphrase` command doesn't generate a brand new, random wallet passphrase. Instead, it takes an existing wallet passphrase as an argument and converts it to a private key and WIF.\n\nIf you're looking to generate a new, random wallet passphrase, I'd be happy to help you with that. However, it's not something that can be done using the `convertpassphrase` command. Would you like some guidance on how to generate a secure passphrase?",
