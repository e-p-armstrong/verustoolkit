    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to list all transactions sent from an address using the `listreceivedbyaddress` command. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `listreceivedbyaddress` command is used to list balances by receiving address, not to list all transactions sent from an address. This command shows the total amount received by each address, the number of confirmations, and other information. If you're looking to list all transactions sent from an address, you might want to consider using a different command. Would you like some help with that?\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. Well, I was also wondering, what is the default value of `includeempty` when using the `listreceivedbyaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default value of `includeempty` is actually `false`, not `true`. This means that by default, the command will not include addresses that haven't received any payments. So, if you want to include empty addresses in the list, you'll need to set `includeempty` to `true` explicitly.",
