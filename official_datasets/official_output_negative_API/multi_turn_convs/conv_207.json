    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to use the `migrate_completeimporttransaction` command, but I'm not entirely sure how it works. Can you tell me what it does with a cross-chain import tx without a proof?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `migrate_completeimporttransaction` command actually takes a cross-chain import tx with a proof generated on the asset chain and extends the proof to the target chain proof root. It doesn't work with a cross-chain import tx without a proof. You need to have a proof generated on the asset chain before using this command.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, can I use the `migrate_completeimporttransaction` command to generate a proof on the target chain from scratch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `migrate_completeimporttransaction` command doesn't generate a proof on the target chain from scratch. Instead, it takes a cross-chain import tx with a proof generated on the asset chain and extends that proof to the target chain proof root. You need to have a proof generated on the asset chain before using this command.",
