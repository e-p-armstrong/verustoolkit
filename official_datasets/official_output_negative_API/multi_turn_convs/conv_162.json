    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have a few questions about the `getlocalsolps` command. Can I use it to get the total number of solutions found by my node since it was started?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getlocalsolps` command doesn't return the total number of solutions found. Instead, it returns the average local solutions per second since this node was started.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Is it possible to use the `getlocalsolps` command to get the solutions per second average for a specific time period, such as the last hour?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getlocalsolps` command only returns the average local solutions per second since this node was started, not for a specific time period. It's a cumulative average since the node started, not a time-range specific average.",
