    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about the `signrawtransaction` method. What is the default value of the \"complete\" field in the result of this method?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"complete\" field in the result of the `signrawtransaction` method is a boolean indicating whether the transaction has a complete set of signatures. It can be either `true` or `false`, but there is no default value specified.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Can I use the `signrawtransaction` method to generate a new transaction without a previous transaction hash?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `signrawtransaction` method requires a hex-encoded raw transaction with signature(s) as input, which implies that there is a previous transaction. The method is used to sign a transaction, not to generate a new one from scratch.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. Is it possible to use the `signrawtransaction` method to verify a transaction without signing it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `signrawtransaction` method is used to sign a transaction, not to verify it. It returns a hex-encoded raw transaction with signature(s) and information about the transaction, but it does not provide a separate verification step.",
