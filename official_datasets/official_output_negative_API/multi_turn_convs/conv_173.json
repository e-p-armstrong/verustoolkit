    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit confused about the `disconnectnode` command. Can you tell me how to use it to connect to a new node?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been a misunderstanding! The `disconnectnode` command doesn't actually connect to a new node. Instead, it immediately disconnects from a specified node. To connect to a new node, you would need to use a different command, such as `addnode` or `connect`.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see! So what happens if I try to use the `disconnectnode` command without specifying a node?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can't use the `disconnectnode` command without specifying a node. The command requires a node argument, which is a string that specifies the node to disconnect from. If you try to use the command without specifying a node, it won't work. The node argument is necessary to tell the command which node to disconnect from.",
