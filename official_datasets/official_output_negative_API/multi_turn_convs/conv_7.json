    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with the `importaddress` command. Can you help me out? How do I use the `importaddress` command to spend funds from an address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, you can't use the `importaddress` command to spend funds from an address. The `importaddress` command is used to add an address or script (in hex) that can be watched as if it were in your wallet, but it cannot be used to spend. It's meant for watching an address, not spending from it.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Thanks for clarifying. What happens if I set `rescan` to `false` when importing an address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you set `rescan` to `false` when importing an address, the wallet will not be rescanned for transactions. By default, `rescan` is set to `true`, which means the wallet will be rescanned for transactions, and this can take minutes to complete. So, setting it to `false` will skip that step.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Can I use the `importaddress` command to import a private key?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `importaddress` command is used to import an address or script (in hex) that can be watched as if it were in your wallet, not a private key. You'll need to use a different command or method to import a private key.",
