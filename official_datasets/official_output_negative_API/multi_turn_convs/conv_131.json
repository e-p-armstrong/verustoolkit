    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a few questions about sending funds on Verus. If I want to send funds from both Sprout and Sapling addresses simultaneously, can I use the `fromaddresses` argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. You cannot send funds from both Sprout and Sapling addresses simultaneously using the `fromaddresses` argument. If a special string is given, any given addresses of that type will be counted as duplicates and cause an error.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What if I don't specify the `fee` argument when sending funds? What's the default fee amount attached to the transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't specify the `fee` argument, the default fee amount attached to the transaction is 0.0001.\n\n**User:**\nI've also got a question about the `transparent_limit` argument. Can I set it to a negative value to merge an unlimited number of UTXOs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't set the `transparent_limit` argument to a negative value to merge an unlimited number of UTXOs. According to the documentation, setting `transparent_limit` to 0 will use the node option `-mempooltxinputlimit` (before Overwinter), or as many as will fit in the transaction (after Overwinter).\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. Can I specify a `memo` field when sending funds to a t-addr?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it is not possible to specify a `memo` field when sending funds to a t-addr. The `memo` field is only stored in the memo field of the new note when `toaddress` is a zaddr.",
