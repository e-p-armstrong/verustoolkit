    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to add a block to the merge mining queue, but I'm not sure how to do it. Is it possible to add a block without specifying any RPC connection details?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, you can't add a block to the merge mining queue without specifying the RPC connection details. To add a block, you need to specify the host address, port, and credentials, along with the hex-encoded block data, in a JSON parameters object. The `addmergedblock` command requires at least these two arguments.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, I need to specify the RPC connection details. But what about the chain name symbol? Is it necessary to specify that as well?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the chain name symbol is a required argument when adding a block to the merge mining queue. You need to include it in the JSON parameters object, along with the RPC connection details. The `addmergedblock` command won't work without it.",
