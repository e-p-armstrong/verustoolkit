    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with the `zcbenchmark` command. Can you explain why it requires a password to run?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `zcbenchmark` command doesn't require a password to run. The command syntax is simply `zcbenchmark benchmarktype samplecount`, and it runs a benchmark of the selected type `samplecount` times, returning the running times of each sample. You shouldn't need to enter a password to use it.\n\n**User:**\nOh, that's good to know. I was getting confused. By the way, what's the default value of `samplecount` if I don't specify it when running the `zcbenchmark` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is no default value for `samplecount`. It is required to specify the `samplecount` when running the `zcbenchmark` command. The correct syntax is `zcbenchmark benchmarktype samplecount`. You need to provide a value for `samplecount` every time you run the command.",
