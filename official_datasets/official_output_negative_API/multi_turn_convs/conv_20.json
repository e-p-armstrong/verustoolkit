    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to add a single-signature address to my wallet using the `addmultisigaddress` command. Can you walk me through how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there might be some confusion. The `addmultisigaddress` command is used to add a multisignature address to the wallet, not a single-signature address. It requires at least two keys or addresses to be specified, along with the number of required signatures. If you want to add a single-signature address, you would use a different command. Would you like me to explain how to do that instead?\n\n**User:**\nHmm, okay. Well, I was also looking at the `addmultisigaddress` command and I saw an \"account\" argument. What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"account\" argument in the `addmultisigaddress` command is actually deprecated and should not be used. If provided, it must be set to an empty string \"\" to represent the default account. Passing any other string will result in an error. So, it's best to just leave it empty.\n\n**User:**\nAlright, got it. And one more question about `addmultisigaddress`. Can I use it to add a multisignature address with a variable number of required signatures?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `addmultisigaddress` command requires a fixed number of required signatures, specified by the `nrequired` argument. This number must be specified when creating the multisignature address and cannot be changed later. So, if you need a variable number of required signatures, you might need to use a different approach. Do you have any other questions about multisignature addresses or the `addmultisigaddress` command?",
