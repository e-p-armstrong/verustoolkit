    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get the total balance of only shielded funds in my wallet. Can you tell me how to use the `z_gettotalbalance` command to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the `z_gettotalbalance` command doesn't provide an option to get the total balance of only shielded funds. When you run the command, it returns the total balance of both transparent and shielded funds, as well as the balance of each separately.\n\n**User:**\nSo how can I get the total balance of shielded funds then?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you want to get the total balance of shielded funds, you can use the \"private\" field in the result of the `z_gettotalbalance` command. That should give you the information you're looking for.",
