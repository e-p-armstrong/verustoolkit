    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to use the `move` command in Verus, and I'm a bit confused about how it works. Can you explain the purpose of the `move` command, and how it's used to send VRSC to another user on the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help clarify! The `move` command is not actually used to send VRSC to another user on the network. Instead, it's used to move a specified amount of VRSC from one account in your wallet to another account in the same wallet. This is a local operation and doesn't involve sending VRSC to another user on the network.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see! So it's more like a way to transfer funds within my own wallet. That makes sense. But I'm still a bit unclear about the \"fromaccount\" and \"toaccount\" arguments. Can I specify any string for those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can't specify just any string for the \"fromaccount\" and \"toaccount\" arguments. These arguments must be set to the empty string \"\" to represent the default account. If you pass any other string, you'll get an error.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! So I just need to use an empty string for those arguments. What about the \"minconf\" argument? Is there a default value for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is a default value for the \"minconf\" argument. The default value is 1, which means that by default, the `move` command will only use funds with at least 1 confirmation.",
