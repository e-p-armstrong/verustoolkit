    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the `z_exportkey` command, and I was wondering what happens if I don't specify the \"outputashex\" argument. What's the default behavior in that case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default behavior of the `z_exportkey` command if you don't specify the \"outputashex\" argument is to output the key data in a non-hex format. The \"outputashex\" argument is optional and defaults to `false`, which means that if you don't specify it, the output will not be in hex bytes.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering about the `z_importkey` command. Can I use it to reveal the private key corresponding to a zaddr?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot use the `z_importkey` command to reveal the private key corresponding to a zaddr. The `z_importkey` command is used to import a private key, not to reveal it. To reveal the private key corresponding to a zaddr, you need to use the `z_exportkey` command.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So what's the purpose of the `z_importkey` command if I can already use `z_exportkey` to get the private key?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_importkey` command is not used to get the private key, but rather to import a private key that you already have. The `z_exportkey` command is used to export a private key from a zaddr, while the `z_importkey` command is used to import a private key into the system. They serve different purposes. Think of it like exporting a file from a computer versus importing a file into a computer - they're two different operations with different goals.",
