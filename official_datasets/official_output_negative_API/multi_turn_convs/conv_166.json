    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about the `getnotarizationproofs` command. How do I use it to request a single challenge proof?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getnotarizationproofs` command doesn't quite work like that. It requires an array of one or more challenge requests as an argument, not a single challenge proof. This means that you need to provide a JSON array with at least one challenge request object, which can have various properties like `type`, `evidence`, `entropyhash`, `proveheight`, and more, depending on the type of challenge.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But what if I want to request both a `confirmnotarization` and a `confirmroot` proof in the same challenge request? Can I do that with `getnotarizationproofs`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, unfortunately not. You cannot request both a `confirmnotarization` and a `confirmroot` proof in the same challenge request. It's not valid to have a challenge request with both `confirmnotarization` and `confirmroot`. You need to choose one or the other, depending on your specific use case.",
