    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `fundrawtransaction` command to sign a transaction, but I'm not sure how. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `fundrawtransaction` command doesn't sign a transaction. Instead, it adds inputs to a transaction until it has enough value to meet its output value. The inputs added will not be signed. To sign a transaction, you need to use the `signrawtransaction` command.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. So what's the purpose of the `fundrawtransaction` command if it doesn't modify existing inputs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `fundrawtransaction` command actually does modify the transaction by adding new inputs to it until it has enough value to meet its output value. It does not modify the existing inputs, but rather adds new ones.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Can I use the `fundrawtransaction` command to remove inputs from a transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `fundrawtransaction` command is used to add inputs to a transaction, not remove them. It adds inputs until the transaction has enough value to meet its output value.",
