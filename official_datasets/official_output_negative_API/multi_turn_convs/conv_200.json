    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to restore a wallet from a backup. Can you tell me how to use the `backupwallet` command to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `backupwallet` command is used to create a backup of your wallet, not restore from one. It safely copies the `wallet.dat` file to a specified destination filename. If you want to restore a wallet from a backup, you would need to use a different command or method.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see! Thanks for the clarification. Can I at least use the `backupwallet` command to backup a specific wallet account?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `backupwallet` command backs up the entire `wallet.dat` file, not a specific wallet account. It does not provide a way to backup individual accounts within the wallet.",
