    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm playing around with the `getidentitycontent` command and I was wondering, what is the default value of the `heightend` argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default value of the `heightend` argument in the `getidentitycontent` command is not `-1`, but rather `0`, which means it will return content up to the current maximum height. If you want to include values from the mempool, you need to set `heightend` to `-1`.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! I was also wondering, does the `getidentitycontent` command always return deleted items in its result?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getidentitycontent` command does not always return deleted items in its result. By default, it does not return deleted items. You need to set the `keepdeleted` argument to `true` to include deleted items in the result.",
