    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the Verus CLI and I'm not entirely sure what the `listaccounts` command does. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listaccounts` command returns an object with account names as keys and account balances as values. It allows you to filter the results based on the minimum number of confirmations and whether to include watchonly addresses. So, it's a handy way to get an overview of your accounts and their balances.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks for the info! Is the `listaccounts` command still supported and not deprecated?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I should let you know that the `listaccounts` command is deprecated, meaning it's no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. It's always a good idea to check the documentation for the latest information on command availability and usage.",
