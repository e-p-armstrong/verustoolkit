    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some issues with banned IPs. I want to add a new IP address to the ban list using the `clearbanned` command. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion. The `clearbanned` command doesn't actually add new IP addresses to the ban list. Instead, it clears all banned IPs, effectively removing all IP addresses from the ban list. If you want to add a new IP address to the ban list, you would need to use a different command. Would you like me to help you with that?\n\n**User:**\nHmm, I thought the `clearbanned` command was used to show the current list of banned IPs. What's the purpose of the `clearbanned` command if it only shows the current list of banned IPs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's still some confusion. The `clearbanned` command doesn't show the current list of banned IPs. Its purpose is actually to clear all banned IPs, effectively removing all IP addresses from the ban list. This command is used to reset the ban list and allow previously banned IPs to access the system again. It's a way to start fresh with a clean slate, so to speak.",
