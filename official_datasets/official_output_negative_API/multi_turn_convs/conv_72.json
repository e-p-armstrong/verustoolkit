    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with my wallet. Can I use the `getinfo` command to unlock my wallet for transfers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getinfo` command doesn't quite work that way. The `getinfo` command is actually used to display information about your wallet, such as the balance, connections, and block count. The `unlocked_until` field in the output of the command shows the timestamp until which the wallet is unlocked for transfers, but it doesn't perform the unlocking itself. You'll need to use a different command to unlock your wallet for transfers. Would you like me to help you with that?",
