    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand how the `getnetworksolps` command works. If I don't pass any arguments, how does it estimate the network speed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't pass any arguments to the `getnetworksolps` command, it will estimate the network solutions per second based on the last 120 blocks. It's a pretty straightforward and convenient way to get an idea of the current network speed.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was also wondering, can I estimate the network speed at a specific block height using the `getnetworksolps` command by passing the block height as the first argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no, that's not how it works. The first argument is used to specify the number of blocks to use for the estimation, and the second argument is used to specify the block height at which to estimate the network speed. So, to estimate the network speed at a specific block height, you need to pass the block height as the second argument.",
