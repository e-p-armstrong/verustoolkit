    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to understand the `migrate_converttoexport` command, but I'm a bit confused. What is the purpose of the `migrate_converttoexport` command if it doesn't convert a raw transaction to a cross-chain export?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been a misunderstanding! The `migrate_converttoexport` command actually does convert a raw transaction to a cross-chain export. It takes in a raw transaction, a destination symbol, and an export amount as parameters, and returns the finished export transaction, along with the payouts. This export transaction can then be used to create an import transaction on a KMD node using the `migrate_createimporttransaction` method.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But I've also been wondering, do you need to fund the transaction using `fundrawtransaction` before signing it with `signrawtransaction`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you're right to wonder about that! Actually, it is necessary to fund the transaction using `fundrawtransaction` if necessary, before signing it with `signrawtransaction`. This ensures that the transaction has sufficient funds to be valid and can be successfully signed and exported.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. What happens if you pass the import transaction to the `migrate_createimporttransaction` method instead of the export transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou should pass the finished export transaction, along with the payouts, to the `migrate_createimporttransaction` method on a KMD node to get the corresponding import transaction. Passing the import transaction instead would not be the correct procedure and may result in an error.",
