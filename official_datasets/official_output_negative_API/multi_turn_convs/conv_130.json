    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `getreceivedbyaddress` command, but I'm having some trouble. Can you explain why it only works with a specific type of VRSC address, like \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, `getreceivedbyaddress` can work with any valid VRSC address, not just \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\". You can use this command with any VRSC address you want to query.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. I was also wondering, how does `getreceivedbyaddress` distinguish between different types of transactions, like payments and smart contracts?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n`getreceivedbyaddress` doesn't actually distinguish between different types of transactions. It simply returns the total amount received by the given VRSC address in transactions with at least the specified number of confirmations, regardless of the type of transaction.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. And one more thing, I read somewhere that `getreceivedbyaddress` only returns the amount received in the last 24 hours. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. `getreceivedbyaddress` returns the total amount received by the given VRSC address in transactions with at least the specified number of confirmations, without any time restriction. It doesn't matter when the transactions were made, as long as they meet the confirmation requirement.",
