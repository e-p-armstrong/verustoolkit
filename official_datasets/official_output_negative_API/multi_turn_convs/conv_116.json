    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm playing around with the `validateaddress` command, and I was wondering, what does it do if the address is invalid?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the address is not valid, the `validateaddress` command will only return the \"isvalid\" property with a value of `false`. It will not return any additional information.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Can I use the `validateaddress` command to validate a private key?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `validateaddress` command is used to validate a transparent address, not a private key. It returns information about the given transparent address, such as whether it is valid, the scriptPubKey, and other details.\n\n**User:**\nI was also looking at the documentation for the `validateaddress` command, and I saw that it returns an `account` property. Is that still supported?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `account` property is deprecated, which means it is no longer supported or recommended for use. You should avoid using it in your applications.",
