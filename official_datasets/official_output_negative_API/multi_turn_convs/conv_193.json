    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to learn more about Verus. Can you help me with something? What is the purpose of the `getblockhash` command in Verus, and how do you use it to get a list of all blocks in the blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblockhash` command in Verus doesn't actually return a list of all blocks in the blockchain. Instead, it returns the hash of a specific block at a given index in the best-block-chain. To use it, you need to provide the index of the block you're interested in, and it will return the corresponding block hash. For example, `verus getblockhash 1000` would return the hash of the block at index 1000.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How do you use the `getblockhash` command to get the block hash of the genesis block?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great follow-up question! The `getblockhash` command requires an index as an argument, and the genesis block is at index 0. Therefore, you can use `verus getblockhash 0` to get the hash of the genesis block.\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I don't provide an index? Is there a default index used by the command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblockhash` command requires an index as a mandatory argument. If you don't provide an index, it will not work. There is no default index used by the command. You need to specify the index of the block you're interested in to get its hash.",
