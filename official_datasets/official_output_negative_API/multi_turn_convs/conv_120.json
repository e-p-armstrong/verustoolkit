    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few questions about creating currencies on the blockchain. Can you explain how to define a currency without an identity on the blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, to create a currency of any kind, the identity it is named after must be minted on the blockchain on which the currency is created. So, it is not possible to define a currency without an identity on the blockchain. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about creating currencies?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. What happens if I try to reuse a symbol for another currency or blockchain after the original identity is transferred?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the rules, once a currency is activated for an identity name, the same symbol may not be reused for another currency or blockchain, even if the identity is transferred, revoked or recovered, unless there is an endblock specified and the currency or blockchain has deactivated as of that end block. So, you won't be able to reuse the symbol without meeting those specific conditions. Do you have any other questions about reusing symbols?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Is it possible to define a currency with a fractional gateway name without specifying any nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, when defining a currency, it is necessary to specify nodes with their network addresses, including the fractional gateway name. The correct format is:\n```\ndefinecurrency '{\"name\": \"coinortokenname\", ..., \"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"identity\"},..]}'\\\n        '({\"name\": \"fractionalgatewayname\", ..., })' ({\"name\": \"reserveonename\", ..., }) ...\n```\n Nodes must be specified as part of the currency definition. You can't skip specifying nodes when creating a currency.",
