    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there, I'm using the `decodescript` command and I'm not entirely sure what it does. Can you help me out? Specifically, what is the purpose of the `decodescript` command with the argument `\"base64\"`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `decodescript` command doesn't take a `\"base64\"` argument. It requires a `\"hex\"` argument instead. This command is used to decode a hex-encoded script. It takes a single argument, which is the hex-encoded script as a string, and returns a JSON object with information about the script, including its ASM representation, hex-encoded public key, output type, required signatures, and addresses.\n\n**User:**\nI see! So, how do I use the `decodescript` command to encode a script?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou don't! The `decodescript` command is used to decode a hex-encoded script, not encode one. It takes a hex-encoded script as input and returns a JSON object with information about the script. If you want to encode a script, you would need to use a different command or tool.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! One more question. What is the default output type of the `decodescript` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe output type of the `decodescript` command is not fixed and depends on the input script. The command returns a JSON object with information about the script, including its output type, which can vary. The output type is one of the fields in the returned JSON object, and it is specific to the decoded script.",
