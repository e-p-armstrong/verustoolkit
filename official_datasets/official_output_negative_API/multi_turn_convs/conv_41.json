    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to figure out how to use `z_sendmany` to send a single payment to a single address. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, `z_sendmany` is used to send multiple payments to multiple addresses. It's not designed for sending a single payment to a single address. If you want to send a single payment, you would use a different command. Would you like me to explain how to send a single payment?\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see. Thanks for clarifying. I also had a question about the `z_sendmany` command. Does it allow you to specify a maximum of 100 zaddr outputs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, according to the documentation, before Sapling activates, the maximum number of zaddr outputs is 54 due to transaction size limits, not 100. So, you can't specify up to 100 zaddr outputs.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question. Can I use `z_sendmany` to send coinbase UTXOs to a taddr and get change?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, when sending coinbase UTXOs to a zaddr, change is not allowed. The entire value of the UTXO(s) must be consumed. This is a specific rule for zaddr outputs, not taddr outputs. So, you won't be able to get change in this scenario.",
