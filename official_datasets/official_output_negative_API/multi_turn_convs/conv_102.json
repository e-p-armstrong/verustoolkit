    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having some trouble with the `kvsearch` command. Can you explain how to use it on a regular blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `kvsearch` command is actually only available for asset chains, not regular blockchains. This means that you can only use `kvsearch` to search for a key stored via the `kvupdate` command on an asset chain, not on a regular blockchain. You won't be able to use it on a regular blockchain. Do you have any questions about asset chains or how to use `kvsearch` on one?\n\n**User:**\nI see. Thanks for the clarification! Actually, I was trying to use `kvsearch` to update a key-value pair on the chain. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been a misunderstanding! The `kvsearch` command is not used to update a key-value pair on the chain. Instead, it's used to search for a key stored via the `kvupdate` command. The `kvupdate` command is the one used to update a key-value pair on the chain. So, if you want to update a key-value pair, you should use `kvupdate`, not `kvsearch`. Does that make sense?",
