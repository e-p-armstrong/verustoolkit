    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having a bit of trouble understanding the `getbestproofroot` command. What is the purpose of this command if it doesn't return the most recent, valid proof root?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `getbestproofroot` command does return the most recent, valid proof root. In fact, it determines and returns the index of the best (most recent, valid, qualified) proof root in the list of proof roots, and the most recent, valid proof root itself. So, it's meant to help you find the most recent and valid proof root from a list of options.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was wondering, can I use the `getbestproofroot` command with a single proof root instead of an array of proof roots?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getbestproofroot` command requires an ordered array of proof roots, even if it's empty. This is specified in the arguments as `\"proofroots\": (array, required/may be empty)`. You cannot use it with a single proof root. You need to provide an array, even if it only contains one element.",
