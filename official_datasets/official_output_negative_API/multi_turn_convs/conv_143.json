    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the `z_gettreestate` command. Can you tell me what it's for and how to use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_gettreestate` command returns information about the given block's tree state. You can use it to retrieve information about a specific block by providing its hash or height as an argument. The result will include the block's hash, height, and other details about its tree state, such as the skip hash and commitments for Sprout and Sapling.\n\nFor example, you can use the command like this: `z_gettreestate <block_hash>` or `z_gettreestate <block_height>`. Replace `<block_hash>` or `<block_height>` with the actual hash or height of the block you're interested in.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Can I use the `z_gettreestate` command to get information about a block with a negative height, like -2 or -3?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the documentation, only a height of -1 is allowed, which refers to the last known valid block. You cannot use negative heights other than -1 with the `z_gettreestate` command. So, no, you can't use it to get information about a block with a height of -2 or -3.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. How do I use the `z_gettreestate` command to get information about all blocks in the blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_gettreestate` command is not designed to return information about all blocks in the blockchain. It is meant to retrieve information about a specific block, identified by its hash or height. You need to specify the hash or height of the block you're interested in as an argument to the command.\n\nIf you want to get information about all blocks, you might need to use a different command or approach. The `z_gettreestate` command is meant for querying a specific block, not for retrieving information about the entire blockchain.",
