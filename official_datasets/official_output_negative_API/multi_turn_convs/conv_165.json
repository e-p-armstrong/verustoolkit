    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to figure out how to send a payment to someone using the `getrawchangeaddress` command. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you shouldn't use the `getrawchangeaddress` command to send a payment to someone. This command is actually used to generate a new VRSC address for receiving change, specifically for use with raw transactions, not normal transactions. It's not intended for sending payments. You'll want to use a different command or method for that.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I was a bit confused. So, what's the purpose of the `getrawchangeaddress` command in normal wallet operations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getrawchangeaddress` command is not intended for normal wallet operations. It's specifically designed for use with raw transactions, which is a more advanced feature. It's not something you'll typically use in everyday wallet operations.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I thought it might return a list of possible addresses for receiving change. Is that correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `getrawchangeaddress` command returns a single new VRSC address for receiving change, not a list of possible addresses. It's a specialized command for a specific use case, and not something you'll typically use in normal wallet operations. If you have any more questions or need help with something else, feel free to ask!",
