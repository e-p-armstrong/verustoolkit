    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `z_mergetoaddress` command, but I'm not sure how to use it. Can you help me out? Specifically, how do I use the command to merge UTXOs to a specific wallet address without specifying the wallet address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can't use the `z_mergetoaddress` command without specifying the wallet address. The wallet address is a required parameter for the command. You need to specify the wallet address as the second argument to the command. For example, if you want to merge UTXOs to a wallet address `ztfaW34Gj9FrnGUEf833ywDVL62NWXBM81u6EQnM6VR45eYnXhwztecW1SjxA7JrmAXKJhxhj3vDNEpVCQoSvVoSpmbhtjf`, you would need to include that address in the command.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But what if I want to merge notes from a specific wallet address to another wallet address? Can I use the `z_mergetoaddress` command for that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `z_mergetoaddress` command isn't designed for that. The command is used to merge UTXOs and notes to a wallet address, not to merge notes from one wallet address to another. The command takes a list of UTXO and note types as its first argument, and a wallet address as its second argument, and merges the specified UTXOs and notes to that wallet address. If you're looking to transfer notes between wallet addresses, you might need to use a different command or approach.",
