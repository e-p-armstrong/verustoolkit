    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm having a bit of trouble using the `verus` command to list all unspent transactions in the entire blockchain. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I need to correct you - the `verus z_listunspent` command doesn't actually list all unspent transactions in the entire blockchain. It lists unspent transactions for a specific set of addresses.\n\nIf you want to use the command, the correct usage is `verus z_listunspent <minconf> <maxconf> <includechange> <addresses>`. Here, `<minconf>` and `<maxconf>` specify the minimum and maximum number of confirmations, `<includechange>` is a boolean indicating whether to include change addresses, and `<addresses>` is a list of addresses to check for unspent transactions.\n\nSo, if you could provide more information about what you're trying to achieve, I might be able to help you further.",
