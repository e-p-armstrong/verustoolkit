    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with the Verus CLI and I came across the `zcrawreceive` command. What's the purpose of this command? Is it used to encrypt a note and send it to the blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the `zcrawreceive` command is used to decrypt an encrypted note, not to encrypt one. It takes a `zcsecretkey` and an `encryptednote` as input, decrypts the note, and checks if the coin commitments are in the blockchain. The output includes the decrypted note plaintext, the amount, and a boolean indicating whether the coin commitments exist in the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I was mistaken about its purpose. Is the `zcrawreceive` command a new feature in the latest version of the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, actually the opposite is true. The `zcrawreceive` command is actually deprecated, meaning it is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. It's not a new feature, but rather an older command that's no longer supported.",
