    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few questions about the `importprivkey` command. What's the maximum number of private keys that can be imported using this command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is no specified maximum number of private keys that can be imported using the `importprivkey` command. In fact, it suggests that you can import a single private key at a time, and it does not provide any information about importing multiple private keys simultaneously.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Another thing I was wondering about is whether the `importprivkey` command always rescans the wallet for transactions.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `importprivkey` command does not always rescan the wallet for transactions. The `rescan` argument is optional and defaults to `true`, but you can set it to `false` to import the private key without rescanning the wallet.",
