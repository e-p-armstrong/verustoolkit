    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use some commands with my Verus wallet, but I'm not quite sure how they work. Can I use the `z_listaddresses` command to import a viewing key?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not the right command for that. The `z_listaddresses` command does not import a viewing key. Instead, it returns a list of shielded addresses belonging to the wallet. If you need to import a viewing key, you should use the `z_importviewingkey` command.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I was also wondering, does the `z_listaddresses` command return a list of all addresses, including transparent addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it doesn't. The `z_listaddresses` command only returns a list of Sprout and Sapling shielded addresses belonging to the wallet. It does not include transparent addresses.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And can I use the `z_listaddresses` command without providing any arguments?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use the `z_listaddresses` command without providing any arguments. By default, it will not include watchonly addresses in the result. However, you can optionally provide the `includeWatchonly` argument set to `true` to include watchonly addresses in the result.",
