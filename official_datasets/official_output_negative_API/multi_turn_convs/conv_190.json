    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get a better understanding of how to use the `addnode` command. Can you help me out? Specifically, how do I use it to list all the nodes in the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! However, I have to correct you - the `addnode` command is not used to list all the nodes in the network. Instead, it's used to add or remove a node from the addnode list, or to try a connection to a node once. If you want to list all the nodes in the network, you would actually use the `getpeerinfo` command.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Thanks for the correction! So, can I use the `addnode` command to connect to multiple nodes at once?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the `addnode` command is used to add or remove a single node from the addnode list, or to try a connection to a single node once. It's not used to connect to multiple nodes at once. Each invocation of the command is used to manage a single node.",
