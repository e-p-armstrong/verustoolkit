But \u2013 beyond this currency \u2013 Verus seeks to become much more than\na zero-knowledge privacy coin, one with two completely new highly-decentralizing proof\nof work and proof of stake algorithms.\nIn addition to payments, decentralization, and privacy features, Verus Project\nplans include its direct use as a currency for provisioning scalable and secure public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), for Verus applications built upon these parallel\nchains to scale. What this will do is simple: It will enable all people \u2013 as well as\nall nodes on the Verus network to participate in and benefit from a decentralized,\nblockchain service economy.\nThis paper details the Verus vision and describes the function of Verus as its own\nplatform, and also as a member of the Komodo platform ecosystem, in the context of its\nfirst applications. Verus core applications will provide a foundation to build additional\napplications and services, which will leverage Verus\u2019 automatically created blockchains,\ncalled autochains. Autochains \u2013 or PBaaS \u2013 will be provisioned and notarized by the\nVerus blockchain miners and stakers, in exchange for Verus currency.\nAutochains will be validated through proof-of-stake by their user populations. In\naddition to extremely scalable, dynamic, publicly-secured autochain applications, this\nwill add a dynamic isolation and security component to applications that can also\ncreate, manage, and verify transactions on the main Verus chain or any other Komodocompatible, Crypto-Conditions [17], Interledger Protocol [25] enabled blockchains.\nThe ways we apply this technology to our world \u2013 to our biggest contemporary\nchallenges \u2013 has the potential to completely remake the fabric of our society.1", "./raw_text_input_vision_paper/VerusVisionPaper"], ["Preface\nHuman progress leapt forward with the invention of money. Money enabled worldwide,\ntrade-based economies to move from a primitive, barter-based system to a consensus-based\nvaluation and accounting of verifiable, storable, divisible, and scarce commodities as early\ncurrencies of exchange.\nEven in recent times, actual or perceived scarcity and authenticity of source, whether\ngenuine gold, an original giant coin of Micronesia [27] \u2013 or government backed notes with\ntrusted fiscal management and the ability to exchange for oil \u2013 provide the foundation of\nvalue upon which, ultimately, human resources are bought and sold.\nWhat blockchain does is straightforward. It enables the creation of cryptographic tools\nand applications that do nothing less than provide us with a new future of programmable\nmoney. This programmable money integrates directly with existent accounting functions\nand, eventually, with all automated services. Blockchain technologies provide humans with\na new, verifiable solution to ensure scarcity, authenticity of source, inbuilt transferability,\nfungibility through privacy, and programmable rules.

While, at first glance, this seems like a\nreasonable approach, it is actually a suboptimal solution, at best.\nWith Ethereum and the ICO experiences of 2017 [9][10], we now know what happens when\nyou create one blockchain and overload it with transactions: Congestion and unnecessarily\nhigh fees.

Autochains, once instantiated,\ncan be used indefinitely or can have a finite lifetime to be used for a specific purpose. In\nthis document, we will often discuss autochains in the context of a few concrete applications\nthat we intend to implement on the Verus network. It is important to keep in mind that\ntheir versatility is basically unlimited. Due to their security being inherited from the main\nVerus chain, autochains eliminate perhaps the biggest disadvantage that creating consensusbased distributed ledger applications suffers from: Weak defense against attacks in their\nearliest stages.\nIn Phase II, Verus will define an autochain provisioning protocol, and specific voting\nprotocols, based on blockchain transactions. These protocols will include zero knowledge\nproofs, Crypto Conditions [17], and Interledger Protocol [25] technologies to provide proper\nincentive for all participants to engage in the automatic creation and use of on-demand,\nisolated or public blockchains, ones that rest on a secure, public foundation.\nThe autochain protocol will also provide the ability to place a value on the data generated\nby the autochain\u2019s operation. This value will then either be released to the public or paid\nout, through rewards, to the participants in the creation of that data. This creates a model\nthat incentivizes release of learning and information to the public \u2013 also making applications\nwhich do so much less expensive to run.\nFor Verus poll applications, validation will default to a form of proof-of-stake (PoS),\nwhere all members of the chain are stakers.

We will\nroll out working vote models in phases, as well, initially providing solutions for weighted and\nunweighted selection voting, which fits well for both political and opinion polls as well as\ncontent classification and ID verification.\n3.3.5Intrinsic Polls", "./raw_text_input_vision_paper/VerusVisionPaper"], ["Once Virtue is activated, the Verus network itself will run specific, intrinsic polls that will\nbe regularly available to identities with Virtue, based on a statistical lottery and weighted\nby their actual measure of Virtue. Participating in these polls, which will be used to classify\ncontent and perform basic, human verification functions, enables participants to help the\nsystem classify and rate content across Verus applications, enabling a rating system rather\nthan censorship to allow each voter to set preferences for the ratings of polls they may wish\nto see.\nMiners who provision autochains for these intrinsic polls will get the same rewards as\nminers setting up autochains for commissioned polls. The content for these polls will be taken\nfrom other polls and will be used to classify and rate those polls for easier discoverability\nand the user experience of poll services.143.3.6Privacy", "./raw_text_input_vision_paper/VerusVisionPaper"], ["There is a fair amount of confusion among the public about privacy on the blockchain. One\ncommon belief is that Bitcoin transactions are private, when in fact all Bitcoin transactions,\nas well as the public addresses between which value is transferred, are public information [21].\nAs with the Verus token and its blockchain, poll autochains will also support zk-SNARKs\nto ensure that votes which have not been disclosed by a voter remain provably anonymous\nto all other parties, while still being verifiable by the person who holds the keys to the\naddress that cast them. Currently, based on standard smartphone hardware specifications\nand the memory requirements of zk-SNARK transactions, mobile phones cannot generate\nz-transactions. In coming releases of new Zcash technology this year, the z-transactions will\nbe more efficient and still provide the same privacy guarantees. When these technologies\nare available, we will work to support them on the Verus chain, as well as use the increased\nefficiency to enable z-transactions and all Verus features on mobile devices as soon as possible. Until that is available, we will work to provide a mobile wallet for Verus transparent\ntransactions.\n3.3.7Content Classification", "./raw_text_input_vision_paper/VerusVisionPaper"], ["While Verus is designed to provide invaluable tools to people across the world, any system\nwithout censorship will also inevitably allow the underbelly of humanity to show through.\nThat means that while we would want all people to participate, we recognize that in order\nfor that to provide the most positive experience for all participants, we must use the Verus\npoll system itself to recognize, rate, and classify the content on its network, enabling those\nwho provide such a service through participation in polls to earn, while enabling the selective\nfiltering of content based on value judgements and classification of honest populations.\nWhile we recognize that the best early use case for such capability is in rating and\nclassifying non-intrinsic polls themselves, the ability to classify content is a fundamental\nstrength that Verus will increasingly develop over time. At first, we expect such classification\nto be applied to relatively simple tasks for humans, such as identifying toxic comments, hate\nspeech, or categories of information. Even though these types of classification systems have\nlargely employed machine learning systems running against privately curated training data,\nour vision is for Verus content classification to enable people to earn, as they classify content\nbetter than any machine learning system, but in a way that can be followed by the best\nmachine learning algorithms, and generalized at scale.\n3.3.8Truth vs. Opinion", "./raw_text_input_vision_paper/VerusVisionPaper"], ["When classifying content, especially when you start to consider challenging classifications,\nsuch as misleading, propaganda, generally accepted fact, accurate versions of history, vs.\nclassification of what should generally be accepted as toxic or rated content that people could\nreasonably answer objectively, one must consider the difference between fact and opinion.\nSelecting the winner of an election is a matter of expressing an opinion. Classifying content\naccording to level of toxicity is a question of determining the factual answer to the question:\nwhat does the majority of the voting population believe the classification to be. Determining15whether an image in one photo is the same image as that from another is a question with\nan objective, if not determinable answer.\nTo ensure that Verus polls support polls that attempt to discover accepted truths, facts,\nand even credible emerging arguments, Verus voters will often be able to stake and either\nearn or lose Verus and in later phases, Virtue, by answering in a manner that matches\nconsensus. For other polls, which are recognized as opinion polls, all answers are equally\nvalid contributions.3.4Random Sampling as a Service", "./raw_text_input_vision_paper/VerusVisionPaper"], ["The Verus system will randomized selection for many of its functions, similar to its Phase I\nPoS block validation system. Blockchain lotteries will be generalized and used for selection\nof participants in randomized polls and in other cases where pseudo-random sampling is\ndesired. The general principles behind Verus lotteries are the same, regardless of whether\nsomething similar to Algorand [29] for guaranteed selection or an original Verus algorithm\nbased on difficulty, such as Verus PoS is used for selection. Lotteries use the blockchain as a\nrandom oracle and are based on the assumption that the exact value of a specific block hash\nfrom a past block in the chain cannot be modified by a byzantine participant to weigh the\nodds in their favor.\n3.4.1Participating in a Lottery", "./raw_text_input_vision_paper/VerusVisionPaper"], ["Since the Verus network is completely decentralized, all lotteries, including PoS, are potential,\nand there is no central server selecting and sending messages to those who qualified in a\nlottery. When lotteries are implemented as a general feature, if you would like to participate\nin any Verus lottery or poll that is distributing tickets via lottery, you must first determine\nthat you qualify for the poll\u2019s requirements. You will then need to submit a transaction that\nproves that you have a valid claim and spend the output transaction of the lottery ticket to\nyour address using that proof. By default, that spend will authorize you to be a validator\non the autochain for the poll you are participating in, by providing you with the currency\nof that poll. You may validate the poll by leaving your wallet running, getting potential\nrewards in Verus or Virtue for both activities.\nLotteries will be useful for selecting subpopulations based on identity and claims people\nmake about themselves or that others claim about them, which they are willing to share.\nWhile detailed discussion of Verus identity is beyond the scope of this paper\u2019s release, the\nVerus system will provide self-sovereign identity with the ability for identities to make very\nflexible claims and have them attested to by other identities. For example, a lottery may look\nfor males between the ages of 18 to 25 among identities willing to share that information,\nwhich will even be possible to verify as strongly as through a validated passport or driver\u2019s\nlicense. Other polls may not require the same evidence backing claims. Polls may also have\nrestricted voting, such as local political polls, where verification and authorization for the\npoll must be provided explicitly, often by mail to a physical address or in person in the form\nof a QR code or electronically delivered transaction to your Verus wallet.163.4.2", "./raw_text_input_vision_paper/VerusVisionPaper"], ["Proof of Stake LotteryA block validation lottery is a somewhat different form of lottery which allows you to claim\nthe right to validate a block and its associated reward based on proof-of-stake (for autochains)\nor 50/50 PoW/PoS (for the main chain). The lottery requires that a prior block hash 100\nblocks past combined with a qualifying UTXO of the destination public key hashed with the\nstaking block height and then divided by the UTXO value must be under the current proof\nof stake validation difficulty. By dividing by the UTXO value, Verus weights proof-of-stake\nor proof-of-virtue in proportion to the amount of stake or virtue in the UTXO. If no one who\nqualifies to validate a block is online or no one responds with a submitted block validation\nin a certain amount of time, the blockchain will wait until someone mines a block using\nproof-of-work.\n3.4.3Ticket Harvesting LotteriesThere will be multiple ways to acquire tickets to participate in any particular poll. The\nmanual ways emphasized so far may include receiving a poll with QR code in post or email\nor perhaps directly from someone taking a poll. In addition to these direct ways to receive a\nvoting ticket, Verus will enable polls to be posted on the poll blockchain as transactions, the\ntickets for which are distributed from its outputs by lottery. This will work when the Verus\nID functionality is available, and will enable polls to require presence of specific claims or\nattestations on an ID, as well as the number of participants to select in the poll by creating\none transaction output for each, which is spendable by a cryptocondition [17] that defines\nthe lottery conditions and random difficulty. The difficulty determines how often a particular\nblock will match any attempt to harvest a ticket from that block.3.5Machine Learning Integration", "./raw_text_input_vision_paper/VerusVisionPaper"], ["Verus enables humans to share and expose human knowledge through voting mechanisms to\nmake decisions, express opinions, and classify accurately. The data used for that classification, as well as the classifications or decisions themselves provide an ideal source of training\ndata for machine learning systems across any domain of human knowledge or opinion. As\ncorporations gather, sequester, and learn from massive amounts of personal data in order to\ncompete and boost their bottom line, rather than accrue to society\u2019s benefit, these massive\nprivate databases serve to affect and influence human populations by knowing more about\nthem than others, or even than they know about themselves.\nSince Verus enables humans to use voting mechanisms to classify and make decisions,\nand stores the results of this process in IPFS and on the blockchain, we will train machine\nlearning algorithms on these results over time, allowing them to eventually classify and make\ndecisions consistent with human decisions and values at an even higher scale. This will enable\nVerus to perform certain tasks automatically, such as the recognition of false or incorrect\nidentification data among participants in the system, the initial classification or rating of\ncertain content that can be overruled, but may not be appropriate for all audiences, and much\nmore. The end result of this is a more secure and trustworthy network, built on consensus\nand trustless principles, leveraging worldwide human knowledge as a base of information and\nmachines for scale.\n17", "./raw_text_input_vision_paper/VerusVisionPaper"], ["A major Verus advantage over almost any other system in its use of Machine learning on\nhuman data is the innate privacy it provides to those whose data is used for learning, along\nwith the default that all resulting information be made public, unless those making polls pay\nthe Verus community a going rate to keep the data for themselves. In today\u2019s society, the\ngoal of most machine learning systems is to match consumers with products they are likely to\nbuy and/or manipulate them into an actual purchase, thus generating revenue. This creates\na situation that can create unintended negative consequences when algorithms disregard any\npositive or negative effects its predictive abilities may have on society [23]. For example, if\nthe algorithm recognizes that people with depressive episodes are more likely to gamble, and\nthus buy airline tickets to gambling-oriented locations, such as Las Vegas, it will advertise\nthose airline tickets to those people. In the Verus system, machine learning algorithms will\nbe able to learn from human beings, while being limited to accessing only the data users\npermit, and at the same time, being unable to easily target any specific individual.3.6Verus Mobile Polls18", "./raw_text_input_vision_paper/VerusVisionPaper"], ["In addition to a desktop wallet that supports Verus and other Komodo platforms or compatible applications, mobile support is a high priority and will provide yet another layer of\nconvenience for users, enabling them to use, earn, and spend Verus in everyday life.
