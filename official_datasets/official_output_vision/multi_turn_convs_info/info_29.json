            "Proof of Virtue (PoV) is a concept that enhances the existing Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm in Verus. It introduces a new \"currency\" called Virtue, which is used as a trust rating of identities within the network. Virtue is tracked on a Virtue autochain and is used to weight staking contests, along with Verus stake, to determine the probability of being selected to process a block of transactions on the Verus Network.",
            "Using a model similar to the EigenTrust algorithm, Verus will introduce the idea of Proof of\nVirtue (PoV) enhancement to the PoS algorithm initially released in Phase I.

Its probabilities upon introduction will not change returns on the Verus PoS\nsystem, but addresses will gradually be able to improve earnings with a Virtue weighting \u2013\nbased on recorded activity and behavior.\nIn order to ensure that Virtue is both a rare and valued property, which drives correct\nbehavior, it will neither be purchased, nor sold. Verus holders will have opportunities to\nearn a small measure of Virtue, which can then be further increased by staking the Virtue\nitself, when attesting to a fact for the network, validating information, or providing another\nmeasurable benefit to the network.\nSince Virtue will have intrinsic value on the Verus network, there will be methods for\ntransferring it through wallet ownership \u2013 for cases of probate or other necessity \u2013 but such\nbehavior as a tool for trading in virtue will not provide a secure or intended method of\n11",

The more Virtue an address has, the higher its probability of being selected.
