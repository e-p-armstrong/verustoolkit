            "According to the Verus vision paper, in today's digital world, information is constantly vying for our attention, trying to convince us of what to buy or believe. Our online behavior is being watched and measured to exploit our lack of online privacy and weaknesses in human psychology, in order to make a profit. This process extracts value from us, affects our behavior, and influences our decisions.",

            "The Verus team believes it is possible to support businesses and governments' requirements with digital systems that respect privacy, give users control over their data, and enable them to speak their minds with anonymous authority. This approach prioritizes the benefit of society first, and then allows for businesses to be supported in that context.",
