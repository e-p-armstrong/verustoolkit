    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand more about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in the autochain and how nodes interact with it. How do nodes on the autochain build reputation and increase their chances of being selected in future lotteries?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNodes on the autochain can build reputation and increase their chances of being selected in future lotteries by consistently offering better Quality of Service (QoS). This is achieved by advertising autochain node support on the main blockchain, along with a stable payment address via a transaction, and then being selected in a random lottery. The Eigentrust ratings of all nodes are recorded by other nodes that serve the chain at regular intervals, which helps to establish their reputation. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What happens to nodes that get poorly rated on the autochain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNodes that get poorly rated on the autochain will still share in the node rewards for the current blockchain. However, they will be less likely to be selected in the next node lottery. It's a way for the network to incentivize good behavior and reward nodes that provide high-quality service.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What is the purpose of the Eigentrust ratings on the autochain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of the Eigentrust ratings on the autochain is to record the quality of service offered by each node. This helps to establish trust in the nodes and allows for the selection of nodes with better QoS in future lotteries. It's a key component of how the autochain operates and ensures that the network is run by reliable and trustworthy nodes. Do you have any more questions about the autochain or Verus in general?",
