    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the Verus vision and how it handles content classification. What is the key consideration when classifying content, especially when dealing with challenging classifications like misleading or toxic content?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen classifying content, it is essential to distinguish between fact and opinion. This distinction is crucial to ensure that classifications are objective and based on verifiable evidence rather than personal beliefs or biases. By making this distinction, Verus aims to provide a fair and reliable platform for content classification. Do you have any further questions on this topic?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I'm also interested in how Verus polls work. How do Verus polls aim to discover accepted truths, facts, and emerging arguments?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus polls aim to discover accepted truths, facts, and emerging arguments by incentivizing voters to answer in a manner that matches consensus. Voters can stake and earn or lose Verus (and later, Virtue) based on their answers, which encourages them to provide objective and accurate responses. This approach helps to surface reliable information and insights.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about opinion polls, where there is no one \"right\" answer? How do Verus polls handle those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus polls, opinion polls are recognized as such, and all answers are considered equally valid contributions. This approach acknowledges that opinions are subjective and can vary widely, and that there is no one \"right\" answer in such cases. By embracing this diversity of opinions, Verus polls aim to provide a rich and nuanced understanding of complex issues. Do you have any more questions about Verus polls or the Verus vision?",
