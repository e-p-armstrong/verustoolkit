    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help you understand the Verus ecosystem. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about autochains. What is their purpose in the Verus ecosystem, and how do they improve security and scalability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAutchains in Verus are used to dynamically create parallel voting chains on demand for each poll in the ecosystem. This approach improves security by isolating each poll's voting process, and allows for virtually unlimited scaling. By doing so, Verus ensures that each poll is secure and can be scaled as needed, without affecting the overall performance of the network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard that the Verus wallet allows voters to earn rewards while participating in polls. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus wallet allows voters to validate blocks through proof-of-stake, which enables them to earn rewards. These rewards are paid in Virtue for intrinsic polls, or from outputs of the payment transaction that instantiated the poll. This incentivizes voters to participate in the polling process, which is essential for the functioning of the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to the voting chain after a poll is complete? And how are the results stored?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter a poll is complete, the results are posted back to the main Verus chain. The voting chain used to run the poll can then be archived or deleted, and is typically abandoned. This approach ensures that the main chain remains lightweight and efficient, while still allowing for the secure and scalable execution of polls.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that blockchains aren't suitable for storing large amounts of data. Can you explain why that is, and what alternative solutions are being considered by Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBlockchains are not ideal for storing large amounts of data due to the massive duplication across the distributed network. Verus is considering alternative solutions, such as the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and Open DHT, which are peer-to-peer file systems that can efficiently store and manage data. These solutions can help alleviate the storage burden on the blockchain, making it more efficient and scalable.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the key requirement for the Verus network, and how do IPFS and Open DHT differ in their support for mobile devices?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe key requirement for the Verus network is that mobile devices be able to participate in its operation. While IPFS has a Javascript library that can be used from the browser or mobile applications, it currently lacks support for mobile devices. Open DHT, on the other hand, is an efficient C++ library intended for use with small devices, making it a more suitable solution for mobile support. This is essential for Verus, as it aims to enable widespread adoption and participation in its ecosystem.",
