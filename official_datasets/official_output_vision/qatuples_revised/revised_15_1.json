    "When can we expect the first mobile experiences to be ready, and what features will they include?",
    "The first mobile experiences are not expected to be ready until the completion of the project's second phase at the earliest. Initially, these mobile experiences will not include support for private transactions, which are planned to be enabled as a foundation for confidential, mobile polling and communications in the future.",
    "In addition to a desktop wallet that supports Verus and other Komodo platforms or compatible applications, mobile support is a high priority and will provide yet another layer of\nconvenience for users, enabling them to use, earn, and spend Verus in everyday life. We intend to provide a Verus mobile experience that functions as a wallet, self-sovereign identity,\nprovides easy access to the polling and earning applications, and is intended to server as an\nextensible application browser, capable of supporting additional applications that leverage\nthe Komodo or compatible ecosystems. While we have already begun thinking about and\nstoryboarding design and development of user experiences, we do not expect any mobile\nexperience to be ready until completion of Phase II at the earliest. Even when the first\nmobile experiences are ready, they will not include the support for private transactions that\nwe intend to enable as a foundation for confidential, mobile polling and communications. To\nget a feel for the way we envision Verus experiences working in practice, below is an example\nof some poll screens from early designs.\n\n4\n\nImplementation and Roadmap\n\nAfter researching options from building the technology ourselves to leveraging unreleased\nadvanced projects, to using one of the few well thought through blockchain application\nplatforms, we decided to start building the Verus project as a friendly fork of Komodo and\nits asset chain technology, enabling us to both become a contributing member of and also\nenhance and extend the Komodo platform as Verus builds blockchain platform technologies\nand real world applications of PBaaS.\nBy leveraging proven zk-SNARK zero knowledge privacy technologies and Komodo\u2019s\ndelayed proof of work (dPoW), which notarizes the main Verus blockchain into Komodo\u2019s\nblockchain, which is then notarized into the Bitcoin blockchain, we underpin Verus with a\nfounda",
