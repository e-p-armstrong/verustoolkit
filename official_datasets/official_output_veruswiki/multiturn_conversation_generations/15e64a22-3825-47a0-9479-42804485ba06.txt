    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

    What are some key features of launching a currency on Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    Some key features of launching a currency on Verus include:


    1. Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or automatically refund if not met.

    2. Dynamic currency launch pricing based on participation.

    3. Pre-launch participation price discounts.

    4. Pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts.

    5. Price-neutral launch pre-allocations.


    All of these features can be specified using easy-to-understand commands and parameters,
    without requiring any programming knowledge.



    **QUESTION:**

    What are some benefits of Verus''s import/export protocol?


    **ANSWER:**

    Verus''s import/export protocol makes it easy and provable to integrate with other
    blockchains. This allows for automatic send/receive of any Verus network token
    between Verus and other blockchains, such as ETH/ERC20 tokens. This means that
    currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, and will be automatically exposed
    on ETH as an ERC20 token.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the concept of multi-chain, dynamic merge mining on Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    Multi-chain, dynamic merge mining on Verus allows multiple Verus network blockchains
    to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus
    and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash. This allows all
    chains to earn rewards and be powered simultaneously.



    **QUESTION:**

    What should I keep in mind when using testnet coins or currencies on Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    It''s important to remember that all testnet coins or currencies have no value
    and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. This means that any coins or currencies
    used on the testnet should not be considered valuable or permanent.'

    **AI Assistant:**

    Multi-chain, dynamic merge mining on Verus is a game-changer. It allows multiple
    Verus network blockchains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge
    mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single
    hash. This allows all chains to earn rewards and be powered simultaneously. It''s
    a great way to increase the security and decentralization of your blockchain.


    **User:**

    Finally, I''ve been experimenting with testnet coins or currencies on Verus. What
    should I keep in mind when using them?


    **AI Assistant:**

    It''s important to remember that all testnet coins or currencies have no value
    and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. This means that any coins or currencies
    used on the testnet should not be considered valuable or permanent. So, don''t
    get too attached to them! They''re meant for testing and experimentation, not
    for long-term use.'
