    "What is the purpose of the `getnotarizationproofs` command in Verus?",
    "The `getnotarizationproofs` command returns proofs to a caller for requested challenges. These proofs can be used to invalidate or force a competing chain to provide more proofs in order to confirm any pending cross-chain notarization of an alternate chain that may not agree with the current chain.",
    "Arguments\n```\n1. \"currencyid\"         (string, required) the hex-encoded ID or string name search for notarizations on\n2. \"(getevidence)\" \t      (bool, optional)  if true, returns notarization evidence as well as other data\n3. \"(separatecounterevidence)\"  (bool, optional)  if true, counter-evidence is processed and returned with proofroots\n```\n#### Result:\n```json\n{\n \"version\" : n,         (numeric) The notarization protocol version\n}\n```\nExamples:\n```bash\n> verus getnotarizationdata \"currencyid\"\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getnotarizationdata\", \"params\": [\"currencyid\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```### `getnotarizationproofs {json object}`\nReturns proofs to a caller for requested challenges. Some proofs can either independently or in combination\nwith other proofs over time invalidate or force a competing chain to provide more proofs in order to confirm\nany pending cross-chain notarization of an alternate chain that may not agree with us.* It is not valid to have a challenge request with both confirmnotarization and confirmroot.",
