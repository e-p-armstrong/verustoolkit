    "What is the purpose of the OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER option in Verus?",
    "The OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER option in Verus is set to 1024. When this option is not set on a gateway, top-level ID and currency registration occur on the launch chain. This means that if the gateway does not have a specific name controller option set, the registration of IDs and currencies happens on the chain where the gateway is launched.",
    "ill publish prices\nOPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER = 1024  // when not set on a gateway, top level ID and currency registration happen on launch chain\nOPTION_NFT_TOKEN = 2048        // single satoshi NFT token, tokenizes control over the root ID\n```",
