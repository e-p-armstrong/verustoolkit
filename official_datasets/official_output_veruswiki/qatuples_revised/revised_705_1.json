    "How do I define a new currency in Verus, and what are some key considerations when doing so?",
    "To define a new currency in Verus, you can use the `definecurrency` command, which takes a JSON object describing the currency's properties. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nSome key considerations when defining a new currency include:\n\n* The currency's name must match the name of the ID that controls it.\n* The `options` field is an integer that determines the currency's properties.\n* The `currencies` field specifies which other currencies the new currency can be converted to.\n* The `conversions` field specifies the conversion ratios between the new currency and other currencies.\n* The `minpreconversion` field specifies the minimum amount of the new currency that must be pre-converted from another currency in order to launch.\n* The `preallocations` field allows you to allocate a certain amount of the new currency to specific IDs.",
    "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sen",
