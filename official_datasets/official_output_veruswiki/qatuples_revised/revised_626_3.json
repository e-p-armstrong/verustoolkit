    "What is the purpose of the `-txconfirmtarget` option in Verus?",
    "The `-txconfirmtarget` option determines how quickly transactions are confirmed in Verus. If the `paytxfee` option is not set, Verus will include a fee in transactions to ensure they are confirmed within a certain number of blocks. The default value is 2, meaning transactions are targeted to be confirmed within 2 blocks on average.",
