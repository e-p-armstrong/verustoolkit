    "Staking now works on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds. This means that users can now stake their funds stored in their VerusIDs, allowing for more flexibility and control over their assets.\n\nNote: Replace \"Verus version X\" with the actual version number.",
