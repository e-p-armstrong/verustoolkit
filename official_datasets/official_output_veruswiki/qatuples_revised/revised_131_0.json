Instead, such an address parsed to the main id@. Since this issue could impact on-chain privacy of someone intending to send to or from a private address and using friendly names, we are considering this a critical privacy release.This version also prevents the wallet from crediting transactions that can be constructed to make a burn look like a spendable output, ensuring that unspendable funds are not added to a wallet or address balance. @Alrighttt, who has been focusing on Verus security testing, reported a way that someone might create such an output, and we appreciate that it is before we have ever seen such transactions on the public or test networks. Thanks @Alrighttt for the report and discretion that helps keep them off the network(s) altogether! We recommend that everyone update as soon as possible to version 0.9.9-5 or later.We are working towards the mainnet PBaaS upgrade version 1.0.0, but we cannot put a specific date beyond \ud83d\udd1c on its release.### What\u2019s New for TestNet\nThis release fixes hopefully the last remaining issue that was causing testnet users to experience sync issues on PBaaS chains.There are no other significant changes.### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
