    "# Question: What should I do if I end up on my own fork because of a network issue or having an old version of the wallet?This solution can be solved in 2 ways: you can simply install the latest bootstrap file (less work, big download) or search manually for the forked block and invalidate that block (time-consuming, no download needed.)## Procedure 1 (Easy, installing bootstrap)For all GUI or CLI users.\n1. Stop the wallet/mining process by cleanly shutting down the program.\n2. Update your wallet if necessary.\n3. Follow the procedure in [HOW-TO Backup, Install or Update and Bootstrap your wallet.md](#!how-to/how-to_bootstrap.md) to efficiently rectify the problem.\n4. Do not be dismayed if it seems that your mining rewards suddenly seem to come to a halt. Remember, when you mine to the wrong chain rewards can come in very quickly, but they are worth nothing.## Procedure 2 (Time consuming, no extra download)",
