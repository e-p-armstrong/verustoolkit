    "How do I define a currency on Verus using the command line, and what properties can I specify?",
    "You can define a currency on Verus using the `definecurrency` command. The command takes a JSON object as an argument, which specifies the properties of the currency. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nIn this example, the currency \"gold\" is defined with the following properties:\n\n* `name`: The name of the currency.\n* `options`: An integer specifying the options for the currency.\n* `currencies`: An array of currencies that the new currency can be converted to.\n* `conversions`: An array of conversion ratios between the new currency and the currencies specified in `currencies`.\n* `minpreconversion`: An array specifying the minimum amounts of each currency required for conversion.\n* `preallocations`: An array specifying the initial allocation of the currency to specific IDs.\n\nNote that this is just an example, and the actual properties and values will depend on the specific use case and requirements of the currency.",
    "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start.
