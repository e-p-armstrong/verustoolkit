    "What is the purpose of the daily cloud backup script for wallet.dat files, and what customizations do I need to make to use it?",
    "The script provided is used to create a daily cloud backup of your wallet.dat file. To use it, you need to customize the following:\n\n1. `SOURCE_FOLDER`: Set this to the location of your VRSC wallet and data folder (e.g. `/home/XXXXX/.komodo/VRSC/`).\n2. `DEST_FOLDER`: Set this to the location of your backup directory (e.g. `/home/XXXX/backup/`).\n3. `passphrase`: Set this to your desired encryption passphrase.\n\nYou should also install `gnupg2` and `gnupg-agent` to enable encryption.",
    "# How to make a cloud daily backup of wallet.dat?\nNote: I use Google Cloud for my staking wallet and backups but the script works regardless of what you use; if you have timelocked coins, you will have to keep your wallet.dat file secure for a long, long time: it's crucial to maintain secure the staking instance as well as the storage..### Important General Information\n`VRSC Wallet and Data location` on Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC`## Procedure:\nIf you use GCloud:\n* create a new directory where we'll upload the backups (ie: mkdir /home/user/backup)\n* create a storage bucket via GCloud console (ie bucket_verus)\n* mount the bucket on your local machine (syntax is: gcsfuse ; ie gcsfuse bucket_verus /home/user/backup)The script can be crontab scheduled to run daily or you can run it manually; if you schedule it, you have to hardcode the encryption passphrase; otherwise you can input it manually each time. You will have to install gnupg2 to encrypt (`sudo apt-get install gnupg2 gnupg-agent`). As always: be sure to fully understand what the script does and why I left some echos to demonstration/test purposes, you can sefely remove all of them.\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash# Customize the SOURCE and the DEST folders\nSOURCE_FOLDER=/home/XXXXX/.komodo/VRSC/\nDEST_FOLDER=/home/XXXX/backup/BCK_DATE=date +%Y-%m-%d.%H:%MSOURCE_FILE=wallet.dat\nDEST_FILE=$SOURCEFILE\"\"$BCK_DATEENCRYPT_EXT=\".gpg\"# all echo are for test purposes, feel free to delete them\necho check variable\necho SOURCE - $SOURCE_FOLDER\necho SOURCE_FILE - $SOURCE_FILE\necho DEST FILE - $DEST_FILE\necho DEST - $DEST_FOLDER\necho TO_BE_DEL - $DEST_FOLDER$SOURCE_FILEsleep 1cp $SOURCE_FOLDER$SOURCE_FILE $DEST_FOLDER$DEST_FILE\nsleep 1\n# Customize the passphrase!!\ngpg2 --batch --yes -c --cipher-algo AES256 --passphrase=\"XXXXXX\" $DEST_FOLDER$DEST_FILE\nsleep 1\nrm $DEST_FOLDER$DEST_FILE",
