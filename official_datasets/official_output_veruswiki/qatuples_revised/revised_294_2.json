    "What are some requirements for creating a chain on the Verus public testnet?",
    "To create a chain on the Verus public testnet, you need to have VRSCTEST in your wallet. Additionally, the chain definition must include a maximum of 3 eras, a minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations, and a minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.",
    "The Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. Sending currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies is as easy as sending a cryptocurrency in less advanced systems today, except that the new Verus protocol enables you to include another blockchain as part of your destination and convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price along the way. All conversions are fully decentralized, require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network, and calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization of any size to make a currency with its own blockchain, support it in world class wallets, develop its own applications, and use it for payments worldwide that can be converted to the reserve currency without ever having to leave the blockchain network. Each blockchain is independent and connected through the Verus Reserve protocol.\n# Notable Changes\n- Fixed daemon output export error message on VRSCTEST\n- Fixed fees bouncing back from a reserve send to Verus and allow exports to continue if done incorrectly\n- Include currency state in chain definitions for both getchaindefinition and getdefinedchains# Chain definition:- Maximum of 3 eras\n- Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations.\n- Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.\nVRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.",
