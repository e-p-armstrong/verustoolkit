    "What is Verus Vault, and how does it work?",
    "Verus Vault is a feature that allows users to protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the user cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. However, the user can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. The user can also still receive funds while the ID is locked.",
