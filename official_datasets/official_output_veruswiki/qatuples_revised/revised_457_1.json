Key points:1. **Preparing for #LaunchPBaaS**: v0.9.9 is MANDATORY, meaning that you will need to upgrade to this release ASAP to stay reliably connected to mainnet after the first preparatory PBaaS upgrade is triggered, both for testnet and mainnet. While the current deadline for being upgraded is in 1 week, it is a soft fork that we would like to activate as soon as possible, and if we can believe that we have more than 50% of the validating network updated earlier than 1 week, we will trigger the activation with our Oracle Notification Technology described in 2. **(Mainnet + Testnet)**",
