    "How does Verus Fee Pooling technology differ from traditional fee models, and what benefits does it offer?",
    "Verus Fee Pooling technology differs from traditional fee models in that it pools all fees from transactions in a block and allows miners or stakers to take a percentage of the aggregate fee pool. This approach provides a more sustainable and equitable fee distribution model, ensuring that miners and stakers are incentivized to continue securing the blockchain while also smoothing out fee income over time.",
    "- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
