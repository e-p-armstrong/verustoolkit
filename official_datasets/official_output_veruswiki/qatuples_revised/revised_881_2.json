    "How do I retrieve a list of currencies that have a certain level of liquidity using Verus?",
    "You can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve a list of currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example, to retrieve a list of currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold, you can use the following command:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\n\nThis will return a list of currencies that meet the specified liquidity criteria.",
    "teidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n## Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n  ```\n  Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
