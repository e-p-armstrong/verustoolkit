    "What is Verus, exactly?",
    "Verus is not just a single blockchain, but rather an entire ecosystem of interconnected blockchains that operate decentralized and at the protocol level. Verus introduces the concept of Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS), which allows anyone to create their own full-fledged cryptocurrency, as long as it can be funded or supported by miners. Newly created chains are just as secure as Verus itself and can be merge mined.",
    "We believe that actions speak louder than words. Anything that may be considered hype can be backed up with functional examples. What we\u2019re doing here is genuine. We are trying to be the real deal, **just as Bitcoin started out, as an open-source, fair launched, no ICO, or pre-mined, or even dev funded project.** Despite this, a foundation has been established by and for fellow community members. There is always more to be done and the foundation regularly pays out bounties to community members that help to make the Verus vision a reality. In fact, just about everything has been designed to reinforce the community. Designed with efficiency in mind, only the miners and stakers are rewarded for securing the chains. This ensures bare minimum costs to the end user starting up a chain and the sleek UI removes the technical barrier.## NEW TO VERUS?### What we\u2019re about:Put simply, Verus is much more than any single ordinary blockchain; more of an entire ecosystem of **interconnected blockchains that all operate decentralized and at the protocol level**. Verus introduces Verus PBaaS (__**Public Blockchains as a Service**__), a true publicly notarized blockchain as a service with an easy to use built in wallet UI, designed to make it so that now anyone can start their very own full-fledged cryptocurrency so long as it can be funded or supported by miners. Newly created chains are just as secure as Verus itself and have the ability to be merge mined (up to __22x__ at once\\!)",
