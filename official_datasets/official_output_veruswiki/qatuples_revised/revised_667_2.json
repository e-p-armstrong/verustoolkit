    "What command should I use to export a wallet in Verus?",
    "To export a wallet in Verus, you should use the command `z_exportwallet FILENAME`, replacing `FILENAME` with the desired name for the exported file. Note that the filename cannot have a `.` in it.",
    "# Question: How to consolidate multiple `wallet.dat` files in one?\n\nAttention: Read it completely before using.\n\n### Verus `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata & `VRSC.conf` standard locations\n * Linux:\t\t`~/.komodo/VRSC`\n * Mac OS: \t`~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`\n * Windows 10: \t`%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`\n * OS independent through Verus Desktop: Click `help`, `Show Verus data folder (default)`\n\n## Procedure\n\n1. With one of the wallets loaded, issue the following command: `z_exportwallet FILENAME` (ie z_exportwallet export_instance01, the filename cannot have a `.` in it.)\n2. Copy the generated file to the machine that hosts your main wallet. This file will either be in the same directory as the config file and wallet.dat file, or in a location specified by exportdir in VRSC.conf.\n3. Issue the following command (on the \"main\" verus-cli): `z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/EXPORTFILENAME` (ie /home/user/export_instance01)\n\nnote: Older versions of verusd required `expordir` to be set in VRSC.conf before exporting a wallet. If you get an error about your export directory not being set, please upgrade immediately.\n\n#### These commands can be given in:\n\n* CLI wallet: `./verus z_exportwallet FILENAME`& `./verus z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/FILENAME`\n* Verus Desktop in `settings`, `coin settings`: `run z_exportwallet FILENAME`& `run z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/FILENAME`\n* Verus Agama in `settings`, `<CLI>`: `z_exportwallet FILENAME`& `z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/FILENAME`\n\n(submitted by @TexWiller, revised by @englal)\n\nnote: last revision date 2020-09-30.",
