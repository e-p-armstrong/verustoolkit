    "How do I find the earliest block that does not match the blockchain using Verus-Desktop?",
    "To find the earliest block that does not match the blockchain, use the `run getblockhash <suspected blocknumber>` command in the Native Client Terminal, and then compare the resulting blockhash with the one shown on the Verus explorer.",
    "### Verus-Desktop\n1. The commands are **all** entered in the *Native Client Terminal* that is located under `Settings`, `Coin Settings`.\n2. Search for the **earliest** block that not matches the blockchain:\n  `run getblockhash <suspected blocknumber>` will show you the blockhash for the blocknumber you filled in\n  The response shown in the *Native Client Terminal* will be similar to this:\n  `5cc7844973fb95ef17f1772ea4aba579f0d8273fb0ee6064cd8e707d1056c646`\n3. Check the blockhash your command gave you against the blockhash the [explorer](https://explorer.verus.io) shows.\n4. If the blockhash from the explorer is different than yours, repeat steps 2 & 3 until you find the earliest block that is different.\n5. Use the **earliest incorrect blockhash** from your system to invalidate that block:\n  `run invalidateblock <earliest incorrect blockhash>`\n  The *Native Client Terminal* will not give feedback on this command.\n6. Now use the **correct blockhash** that the explorer gave you for the block you just locally invalidated:\n  `run reconsiderblock <correct blockhash>`\n  Again the *Native Client Terminal* will not give feedback on this command.\n7. Once your wallet connects to a node that is on the correct chain, it will quicly synchronize.\n  If needed you can either restart your wallet to force new connections or manually disconnect bad nodes.",
