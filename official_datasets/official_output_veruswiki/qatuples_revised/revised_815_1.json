    "The OPTION_NFT_TOKEN option in Verus is set to 2048. This option enables the creation of a single satoshi NFT (non-fungible token) that tokenizes control over the root ID. This means that the NFT token represents ownership and control over the root ID, and can be used to manage and transfer that control.",
