    "What makes VerusIDs more than just an ID system?",
    "VerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. This means that they provide a range of features and capabilities beyond a traditional ID system.",
    "VerusIDs are true self-sovereign identities and aren't simply an ID system as much as a fully functional blockchain protocol. There is no business in the protocol, but plenty of opportunity for those who use what it can do for identity applications. Verus ID provides:**Quantum ready** friendly crypto addresses on the worldwide Verus network -- VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID -> destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.**Fully decentralized** -- anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.",
