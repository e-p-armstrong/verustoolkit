    "What is the next step for the Verus community after delivering on the original phases of the vision?",
    "The next step for the Verus community is to create use cases that realize the promise of the network, leveraging its advantages over other platforms. This involves building on the existing geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform.",
    "As always, we do not promise, we describe a vision and welcome contributors from everywhere. Now that we, as a community, have delivered on the original phases of the vision together, it is time for all of us to consider what we might want to build over this incredible, geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform. Our next efforts across the community should be to realize the promise of this network in the use cases we create, use cases that we will have an advantage creating on Verus over any other platform because it really is that much better.### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see.
