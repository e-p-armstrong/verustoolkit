    "What features does Verus offer in terms of currency management and exchange?",
    "Verus offers features such as reserve-backed currencies with fractional reserve capabilities, cross-chain transactions, and conversions handled by a built-in market maker. This allows for seamless exchange of currencies between different wallets and eliminates the problem of front-running.",
    "Benefiting both the user and the miners, self-strengthening the ecosystem and ensuring minimal fees (no room for middlemen to take a cut). Reserve backed currencies are also possible with __fractional reserve__ capabilities and since interoperability is paramount, exchanging currencies in __cross-chain transactions__ is as simple as sending coins from one wallet to a different coin\u2019s wallet. __Conversions__ are handled by a built in market maker that automatically determines price based on a predetermined curve and issues orders fairly to all buy/sells within a block, with zero spread and the added benefit of eliminating the well- established problem of front-running, just some amount of slippage based on the net buy/sell.. With reserve currencies, buyers can make buys without even needing sellers (and vice versa).\nAmazingly, everything is done at the __protocol level__ on a decentralized network, meaning Verus and it's associated chains can't be censored or stopped.## Getting started:\n### Important links:Website: [*https://verus.io*](https://verus.io)\nWallet: [*https://verus.io/wallet*](https://verus.io/wallet)\nGitHub: [*https://github.com/veruscoin*](https://github.com/veruscoin)\nExplorer: [*https://explorer.verus.io*](https://explorer.verus.io)\nDiscord: [*https://verus.io/discord*](https://verus.io/discord) Check [https://youtu.be/YVOfIMjRf30](Human Verification) if you only see one empty channel.\nBitcointalk: [*https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4070404.0*](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4070404.0)Max Supply: 83,540,184\nAlgorithm: VerusHash 2.1 PoW/PoS - 50/50\nBlock time: 1 minute\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) ROI is currently between 6% and 8%\nHalving Frequency: roughly every two years\nNext Halving: Current ETA: Jan 2025 (Block \\#3,381,840)\nHalving Countdown: [*https:/countdown.verus.io/halving*](https://countdown.verus.io/halving)## VerusID",
