    "What happens to transactions sent to an identity that is updated to use a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure?",
    "If a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure, is added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend condition.",
    "ntity must have a set of addresses (1 or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. Each identity also refers to two additional identities that have authority over:\n  - **Primary** - this is the self identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.\n  - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n  - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.\n3. Identities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party\u2019s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.\n4. If an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using \u201cz_getbalance identity@\u201d.\n5. If later, a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure s added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend condition",
