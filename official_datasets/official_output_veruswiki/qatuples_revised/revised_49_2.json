    "How do fees work when registering identities on a currency in version 1.0.1 of the PBaaS protocol?",
    "When registering identities on a currency in version 1.0.1 of the PBaaS protocol, the fee for the registration is sent directly to the identity of the currency, rather than being burned into the currency.",
    "### What\u2019s New\nIn addition to the full PBaaS protocol and all capabilities previously described, version 1.0.1 will also include some new capabilities that were previously not in the PBaaS protocol. The capabilities basically extend the idea of a centralized currency to include the ability to launch temporarily centralized currencies, including those that can issue identities. This is achieved by setting the \u201cendblock\u201d on a centralized currency launch of either a token or liquidity basket, enabling:\n 1) Minting of currency on demand by the identity of the currency as part of the `sendcurrency`command.\n 2) Burning a liquidity basket currency, but instead of affecting the supply/reserve ratio as normal burns do, the identity of a centralized currency can also burn currency to affect the reserve ratio weights of the currency.\n 3) Registering identities on a currency. When an identity is registered on a centralized currency, the fee for the registration is not burned into the currency, but sent directly to the identity of the currency. This is true for token or liquidity basket currencies. For decentralized currencies, fees are burned, which on a liquidity basket, puts them into the liquidity pool for all LPs to share in earnings, and for a standard token, reduces the supply and available future registrations on that currency.\n 4) In v1.0.1, setting the endblock of a centralized currency causes all centralized capabilities of the same ID to end, converting it in whatever state it currently is in a decentralized currency with no special control over it after that occurs by any identity on the network.\n 5) v1.0.0 did not allow a decentralized non-liquidity token to register identities. v1.0.1 does.",
