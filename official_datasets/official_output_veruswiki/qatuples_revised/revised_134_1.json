    "How does Verus ensure the security of my transactions when I update my identity to use a new address type?",
    "Verus ensures the security of your transactions by retroactively applying the spend conditions of the new address type to all existing transactions sent to your identity. This means that even if you have a large number of transactions sent to your identity, upgrading to a quantum-secure address will secure all of those transactions, protecting them from potential quantum attacks.",
    "ain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well. That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.",
