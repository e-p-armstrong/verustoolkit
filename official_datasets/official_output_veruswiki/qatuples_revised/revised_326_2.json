    "How can I get currency statistics for a range of blocks with a specific period between them using Verus?",
    "To get currency statistics for a range of blocks with a specific period between them, you can use the `getcurrencystate` command with the start block number, end block number, and the number of blocks to step as arguments. The command to do this is:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```\nReplace `startblocknum` with the number of the first block in the range, `endblocknum` with the number of the last block in the range, and `blockstostep` with the number of blocks to step between each retrieved statistic.",
