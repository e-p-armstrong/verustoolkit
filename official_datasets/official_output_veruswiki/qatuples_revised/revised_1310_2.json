    "What is a fractional reserve currency on Verus, and what are the risks associated with it?",
    "A fractional reserve currency on Verus is a currency that is backed by a fraction of the total supply of another currency, in this case, Verus. The risks associated with such a currency include volatility, as the value of the currency can fluctuate greatly depending on the reserve ratio and the actions of the currency creators. In extreme cases, as seen with the RaceCondition currency, it can lead to a situation where the currency creators exit with their funds, leaving the remaining currency holders with a devalued and under-reserved currency.",
    "## v1.0.6\nAnnouncing v1.0.6 - MANDATORY MAINNET UPGRADE WITH COMMUNITY AGREED DEADLINE ON TUESDAY, MAY 30th, 19:00 UTCAs everyone can see, there is a currency on the chain called RaceCondition, which someone has defined and is a 5% algorithmically controlled fractional reserve of Verus. While these currencies are tools, and there may be good reasons for 5% currency components or even 5% currencies in some applications, this was launched as a VERY low reserve (launched with 10 VRSC in reserves), high supply currency (100 million supply), and as volatile as the protocol allows at 5%.The extreme nature of the currency and the fact that the person who launched it exited with their entire pre-launch amount when someone else joined resulted in a behavior different than what I would expect. Someone converted into the currency, which was clearly all in the hands of one individual. That individual then converted all of the currency they got at launch to VRSC, getting the highest price they could get for all of their currency and leaving the highly volatile, 5% fractionally backed currency with far fewer reserves relative to supply than it had before, basically an exit scam for a grand total of 4 VRSC.",
