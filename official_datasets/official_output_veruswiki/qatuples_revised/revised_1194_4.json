    "How do I specify which addresses should have the fee deducted from their amounts when sending VRSC?",
    "You can specify which addresses should have the fee deducted from their amounts using the \"subtractfeefromamount\" argument. It should be a JSON array with the addresses that should have the fee deducted. For example:\n```json\n[\n  \"address1\",\n  \"address2\",\n ...\n]\n```\nIf you don't specify any addresses, the sender will pay the fee.",
    "#### Arguments:\n1. \"fromaccount\"     (string, required) MUST be set to the empty string \"\" to represent the default account. Passing any other string will result in an error.\n2. \"amounts\"       (string, required) A json object with addresses and amounts\n```json\n  {\n   \"address\":amount  (numeric) The VRSC address is the key, the numeric amount in VRSC is the value\n   ,...\n  }\n```\n3. minconf         (numeric, optional, default=1) Only use the balance confirmed at least this many times.\n4. \"comment\"       (string, optional) A comment\n5. subtractfeefromamount  (string, optional) A json array with addresses. The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each selected address. Those recipients will receive less VRSC than you enter in their corresponding amount field. If no addresses are specified here, the sender pays the fee.\n```json\n  [\n   \"address\"      (string) Subtract fee from this address\n   ,...\n  ]\n```#### Result:\n\"transactionid\"     (string) The transaction id for the send. Only 1 transaction is created regardless of the number of addresses.Examples:",
