    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with multi-currency in Verus, but I want to make sure I'm aware of any limitations. What are some limitations of multi-currency in Verus that I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are two main limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus. Firstly, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used, and is not supported for creating currencies. Secondly, in the GUI, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, you will not be able to use that same named currency as a PBaaS chain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks. I'm still a bit curious about the first limitation, though. Why is it not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt is not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name because it can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I also had a question about Verus Desktop software. What's the current status of it, and what kind of warranty does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis software is currently experimental and unfinished. It comes with no warranty for any kind of damage, and users are advised to use it at their own risk.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What are the terms of use for this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell, with no restrictions. However, the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.",
