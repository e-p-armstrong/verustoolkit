    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been exploring the multi-currency functionality in Verus and I was wondering, what are some limitations I should be aware of when creating currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen creating currencies using multi-currency functionality in Verus, there are a few limitations to keep in mind. One limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is to avoid confusion and potential problems when referring to the currency or identity. Additionally, in the GUI version, you cannot use the names of already supported currencies (like BTC or ETH) as a PBaaS chain. Are you planning on creating a currency and wondering about these limitations?\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. Why can't I use an i-address as the actual name of an ID when creating a currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsing an i-address as the actual name of an ID when creating a currency in Verus is not recommended because it can cause confusion and problems when referring to the currency or identity. This is because an i-address is typically used to refer to a currency or identity based on its name registration, rather than being used as the actual name of the ID. It's just a way to avoid potential issues and keep things clear.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen a disclaimer somewhere in the software that says it's experimental and unfinished. What does that mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer indicates that the software is experimental and unfinished, and should be used at your own risk. It also provides information about the licensing terms of the software, including the permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software freely, as long as certain conditions are met. It's just a way to let users know that the software is still in development and might not be perfect, but it's still available for use and testing. Do you have any other questions about Verus or its functionality?",
