    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm about to update Verus to a new version. What's the first step I should take?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen updating Verus to a new version, the first step is to stop the Verus daemon by running the command `./verus stop`. This ensures that the daemon is not running while you update the binaries. It's an important step to avoid any potential issues during the update process.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the old versions of the binaries? Should I do something with them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, it's a good practice to rename the old versions of the binaries when updating Verus. This ensures that you can easily revert to the old version by renaming these files if needed. This provides a safety net in case something goes wrong during the update process.\n\n**User:**\nI store my Verus wallet.dat, Chaindata, and VRSC.conf files in a non-standard location, such as an external hard drive. What do I need to do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf your Verus files are stored in a non-standard location, you may have a `datadir` specified in your VRSC.conf file. After updating Verus, navigate to the directory where your files are stored and check that the `datadir` is still correct. If it's not, edit the VRSC.conf file to append the correct `datadir` path.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I start the Verus daemon again after updating to a new version?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo start the Verus daemon again after updating to a new version, simply run the command `./verusd`. You can add any other start options as needed, which can be found in the Verus documentation.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I verify that the new version of Verus is working correctly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify that the new version of Verus is working correctly by running the command `./verus getwalletinfo`, which will display information about your wallet. If the command runs successfully and displays the expected information, it's a good indication that the new version is working correctly.",
