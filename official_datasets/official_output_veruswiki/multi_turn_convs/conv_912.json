    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a new chain using Verus. Can you walk me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a new chain using Verus, you can use the `definechain` command with the following format:\n\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [...], \"notarizationreward\" :..., \"billingperiod\" :..., \"nodes\" : [...] }'\n```\n\nYou need to provide the chain name, eras, notarization reward, billing period, and node information in the JSON object. Do you have any questions about the format or the information you need to provide?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for that. I was also wondering, what are the requirements for defining a new chain on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen defining a new chain on Verus, there are some requirements to keep in mind:\n\n1. A maximum of 3 eras can be defined.\n2. A minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations is required.\n3. A minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization is required.\n4. You need to have VRSCTEST in your wallet to make a chain.\n\nMake sure you meet these requirements before trying to define a new chain.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! One more question. Where are the config files for PBaaS chains stored on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe config files for PBaaS chains on Verus are stored in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME` directory, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain. The presence of a correct config file for any chain enables the chain to load as an independent chain.",
