    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a question about the recovery authority in a VerusID. What is its purpose, and how does it interact with the revocation authority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe recovery authority in a VerusID is a separate authority that can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and recovery state. This authority defaults to the ID itself, but can be set to another ID. The recovery authority cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I also had a question about the private addresses and content map in a VerusID. What are the benefits of these features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe private addresses in a VerusID can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and the content map of key-value hashes can be used to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity. These features enable users to maintain control over their data and identity while still being able to prove certain aspects of their identity when needed.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the VerusHash 2.1 algorithm. What's its goal, and how does it affect the performance of FPGAs and CPUs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe goal of the VerusHash 2.1 algorithm is to further equalize the performance of FPGAs and modern CPUs, building on the success of VerusHash 2.0. The algorithm is designed to tilt the balance slightly more in favor of CPUs, while still allowing FPGAs to operate with minor modifications. This aims to promote a more level playing field for miners and stakers on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also heard that the Verus developers reached out to FPGA manufacturers with the new VerusHash 2.1 algorithm. Why did they do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus developers reached out to FPGA manufacturers to ensure that they have an opportunity to mine and stake on the Verus network when it launches. This proactive approach aims to promote a fair and inclusive environment for all participants on the network.",

While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.\n# Disclaimer",
