    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about the Verus software. What kind of warranty or liability does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty or liability. This means that the authors or copyright holders are not responsible for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I've also been having some issues with my antivirus software. Why might it flag the Verus software as a potential threat?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAntivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, this is a false positive, and the software is safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Where can I find more information about these false positive warnings from antivirus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about the false positive warnings from antivirus software by reviewing the following resources:\n* https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/\n* https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the resources! I'd like to download Verus, but I want to make sure I get the right version and verify its integrity. What are the available downloads for Verus, and how can I verify their integrity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe available downloads for Verus are:\n* MacOS: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b1cfb315844850fdd2c89473fb7439c0c021e92d13e0a1db560303f0f83b0235/detection\n* Linux-x86-64: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e90b011427be1aa5d78ac2e2d69bc96ee8c2fd8209a97cb51e19a395d0ced94f/detection\n* Linux-ARM64: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/be9785dfb3438de8a07c405dbfb71eca0477f45c875046a1bc561e819097d347/detection\n* Windows: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/cab29d9bd73d9b1f1cd5dc86b6b6f3f13807d101ef4ae3f224d90e6788ede3b0/detection\n\nYou can verify the integrity of the downloads by checking the VirusTotal detection results for each file.",
