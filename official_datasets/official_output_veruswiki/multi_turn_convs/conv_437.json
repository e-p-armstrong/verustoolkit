    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in trying out the Verus testnet. How do I launch it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch the testnet for Verus, you can run the following command:\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST\n```\nThis will get you started with the Verus testnet. Let me know if you have any issues or need further assistance!\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks! I was also wondering about the licensing terms for the Verus software. What kind of license does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is released under a permissive free software license, which allows anyone to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, without restriction, as long as the copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. What about warranty or liability? Is there any kind of guarantee or protection for users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software.\n\nSo, basically, you use the software at your own risk, and the developers aren't responsible for any issues that might arise. Does that make sense?",
