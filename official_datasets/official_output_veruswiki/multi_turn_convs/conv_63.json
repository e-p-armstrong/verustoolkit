    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some of the flags used in Verus. Can you help me with that? Specifically, I'm looking at the OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER flag. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER flag, set to 1024, determines where top-level ID and currency registration occur when not set on a gateway. Specifically, it ensures that these registrations happen on the launch chain. Does that make sense? Do you have any other questions about this flag or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. Another flag I'm not entirely sure about is the OPTION_NFT_TOKEN flag. Can you explain what it's used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe OPTION_NFT_TOKEN flag, set to 2048, is used to create a single satoshi NFT (non-fungible token) that tokenizes control over the root ID. This means that the NFT token represents ownership and control of the root ID. It's an important feature in Verus, allowing for unique and verifiable ownership of digital assets. Do you have any more questions about NFTs or Verus in general?",
