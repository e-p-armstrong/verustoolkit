    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand the `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. It's a useful tool for finding currencies that meet certain liquidity and reserve requirements.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. How do I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies that have a market for a specific pair of currencies, such as BTC and ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API by running the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have a BTC/ETH market at or above the liquidity threshold. Just replace `btc` and `eth` with the currencies you're interested in, and you'll get a list of currencies that have a market for that pair.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What criteria does the `getcurrencyconverters` API use to filter currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API filters currencies based on three criteria:\n\n1. The currency must have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve.\n2. The currency must have a VRSC reserve ratio greater than 10%.\n3. The currency must have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\nOnly currencies that meet these criteria will be returned by the API. This helps ensure that the currencies returned have sufficient liquidity and reserves to support trading and conversions.",
