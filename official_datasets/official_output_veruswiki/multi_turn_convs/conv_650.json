    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few questions about using VerusIDs and the Verus software. What is a limitation of creating a currency from an ID in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because an i-address will be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. It is advised to avoid creating IDs with i-addresses as their names, as it may cause problems and confusion.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been experimenting with creating a PBaaS chain using the GUI. What is a limitation of the GUI in Verus when creating a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you cannot use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This is a temporary limitation that will be resolved in future releases.\n\n**User:**\nI understand. Before I continue using Verus, I want to make sure I understand the terms of use. What is the disclaimer for using Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer for using Verus software is that it is experimental and unfinished, and users use it at their own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage. However, the software is open-source, and users have the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, as long as the copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.",
