    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm playing around with creating a currency from an ID in Verus, and I was wondering if there are any important considerations I should keep in mind?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is an important consideration when creating a currency from an ID in Verus. Be aware that you cannot make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. The general advice is to avoid doing this, as it can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used. It's essential to keep this in mind to avoid any potential issues.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the tip! I'm also interested in creating PBaaS chains using the Verus GUI. Are there any limitations I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus GUI, there is a limitation to be aware of when creating PBaaS chains. If a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata and is expected to be resolved in future releases. Just keep that in mind when working with the GUI.\n\n**User:**\nGood to know. Before I dive deeper into Verus, I was wondering about the disclaimer and licensing for the software. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer for using Verus software is that it is experimental and unfinished, and users use it at their own risk with no warranty for any kind of damage. As for the license, Verus software is released under a permissive license that allows users to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, as long as the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. So, feel free to explore and use Verus, but keep in mind that it's still in development and use it at your own risk.",
