    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm interested in the current status of the DeFi, ID, and PBaaS cross-chain protocols on the testnet. Are there any expected changes before the mainnet release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAs of now, there are no known bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross-chain protocols on the testnet. Additionally, no changes are anticipated to the PBaaS protocol before the mainnet release. The team is confident in the current state of the protocols and is focusing on preparing for the mainnet launch.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I've been thinking about testing the testnet and reporting any bugs I might find. What is the Verus Coin Foundation offering to encourage testing and bug reporting on the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bug bounty program to encourage testing and bug reporting on the testnet. The rewards are pretty attractive too! For the first 10 people to report an actual protocol bug, a minimum of 500 VRSC will be rewarded. If you report an exploitable security hole, you'll receive a minimum of 1,000 VRSC. And if you find a serious potential security issue, you'll be rewarded with a minimum of 10,000 VRSC. So, it's definitely worth taking a look and seeing if you can find anything.\n\n**User:**\nI actually reported a bug a little while back, since the bounties for the 0.9.5+ versions were announced. What should I do now?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have already reported a bug since the bounties for the 0.9.5+ versions were announced, you're all set! You're on the list, and someone from the Foundation will reach out to you in the near future. They'll be in touch to discuss your report and provide any necessary next steps. So, just sit back and wait for them to get in touch.",
