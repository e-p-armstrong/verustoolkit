    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to work with multi-currencies on Verus and I was wondering if there are any limitations I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are a couple of limitations to keep in mind when working with multi-currencies on Verus. Firstly, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. This is because the protocol will interpret the i-address as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration, causing problems in many cases.\n\nSecondly, in the GUI, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same names as a PBaaS chain. Just something to be aware of when setting up your multi-currency system.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the heads up! I just updated Verus to a new version and I was wondering, why am I required to delete specific directories after updating?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter updating Verus to a new version, you may need to delete specific directories to ensure a clean start. This is because the testnet was deleted and relaunched, and old data may cause issues with the new update. The directories to delete vary by operating system. On Linux, you'll need to delete `~/.komodo/vrsctest`, on MacOS, it's `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`, and on Windows, it's `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`. Just make sure to delete those directories to avoid any potential issues with the new update.",

            "There are two main limitations to be aware of:\n\n1. You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. This is because the protocol will interpret the i-address as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration, causing problems in many cases.\n2. In the GUI, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same names as a PBaaS chain.",
            "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/vrsctest\n```**MacOS**\n```\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest\n```**Windows**\n```\n\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST\n```# Disclaimer",
