    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having a bit of trouble with signing transactions from a multi-signature ID on the Verus testnet. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! To sign transactions from a multi-signature ID, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction with the `sendcurrency` command, specifying the multi-signature ID and the transaction details.\n2. Get the raw transaction data using `z_getoperationstatus` with the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n4. Use `signrawtransaction` to sign the transaction with each additional wallet.\n5. After all necessary signatures are applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `sendrawtransaction` with the signed transaction data.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about these steps or if you're still having trouble!\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! I've also been hearing a lot about the new Verus testnet. What are some key features of it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers:\n\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Easy GUI for basic operations and command line for advanced functions\n* Ability to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange\n\nIt's a really exciting development for the Verus ecosystem, and I think you'll find it offers a lot of possibilities for decentralized finance and more! Do you have any specific questions about the testnet or its features?",
