    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about using Verus. How can I get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block by running the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate\n```\nThis command will retrieve the currency statistics for the most recent block on the specified chain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! What if I want to get currency statistics for a specific block?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get currency statistics for a specific block by running the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\nReplace `blocknum` with the number of the block for which you want to retrieve the statistics.\n\n**User:**\nI see, so I can specify the block number. What if I want to get currency statistics for a range of blocks with a specific period between them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get currency statistics for a range of blocks with a specific period between them by running the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```\nReplace `startblocknum` with the number of the starting block, `endblocknum` with the number of the ending block, and `blockstostep` with the period between the blocks.\n\n**User:**\nGreat, thanks for explaining that. What if I contributed to a failed PBaaS chain launch and want to refund my contributions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you contributed to a failed PBaaS chain launch and want to refund your contributions, you can use the command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME\n```\nReplace `CHAINNAME` with the name of the failed chain.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more thing, what should I be aware of when using Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou should be aware that Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and you use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and you should not use it on mainnet. Additionally, the software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.",
