    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm considering launching a new token or blockchain project and I heard that VerusIDs might be helpful. What benefits do VerusIDs offer when launching a new token or blockchain project?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs offer several benefits when launching a new token or blockchain project. For instance, they allow you to allocate proceeds, offer pre-launch discounts to early participants, and implement vesting schedules in pre-allocations. This can make your project more attractive to investors and help you manage your token distribution more effectively.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds useful. But I'm not entirely sure what the Verus network is or how it works. Can you explain the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network and its key features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a decentralized network that allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. Notary IDs provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be merge-mined and staked, as well as private, internal blockchains that can be easily set up with bridging of public currencies. The network has no limit on the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate simultaneously. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and customization for your project.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I've heard about time locks on VerusIDs. What is the purpose of a time lock on a VerusID, and how can it be set?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA time lock on a VerusID defines the unlock height of the identity, effectively locking the ID until a specific block height is reached. This can be set using the `updateidentity` command, specifying the unlock block height, minimum signatures, and primary addresses. Time locks can be useful for ensuring that certain actions can't be taken with an ID until a certain point in the future.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But what's the difference between a time lock and a time delay on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA time lock defines the unlock height of an ID, whereas a time delay defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. This means that a time lock sets a specific block height for unlocking, while a time delay sets a waiting period before the ID can be unlocked.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What happens to a locked identity if it is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a locked identity is revoked, its locked status is cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height that was set.\n\n**User:**\nAnd can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.",
