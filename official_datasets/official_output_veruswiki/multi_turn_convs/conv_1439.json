    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring the Verus API and I'm curious about the `getcurrencyconverters` API. What is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus retrieves a list of all currencies that meet certain liquidity and reserve ratio criteria. Specifically, it returns currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve and a reserve ratio of greater than 10%. Additionally, these currencies must have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. But I'm still a bit unclear on how to use it. How can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies with specific markets, such as BTC and ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies with specific markets by specifying the markets as arguments. For example, to find currencies with BTC and ETH markets, you can run the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return a list of all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold. Have you tried running this command?",
