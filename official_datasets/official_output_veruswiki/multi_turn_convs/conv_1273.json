    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been learning about DeFi and I have a question about Verus. How does the Verus DeFi protocol address the issues of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions using a particular liquidity pool and mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. Additionally, it provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been wondering, what's unique about the launch of a new blockchain on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, the launch of a new blockchain is accompanied by the simultaneous launch of a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This liquidity pool is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This is a unique feature of Verus that sets it apart from other blockchain platforms.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also been looking into crowdfunding options on Verus. What options are available for customizing a blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launch on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, users can customize their blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launch by setting maximum participation in one or more currencies, offering pre-launch discounts, and making price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies. Additionally, users can also make price-neutral carve-outs. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and customization when launching a new crowdfunding currency on Verus.",
