    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the different types of IDs in Verus. What is the difference between Native IDs and IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNative IDs, registered directly from a blockchain, can launch currencies on that blockchain and, if on Verus, create actual independent blockchains. IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies, on the other hand, cannot launch currencies but are still valuable as revocation and recovery IDs, as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with various features.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, but are there any exceptions to non-native IDs creating currencies in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is an exception. *.veth gateway IDs, available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter, can create Ethereum mapped currencies.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been wondering about the registration of.veth IDs. What is the purpose of pricing the registration of.veth IDs in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe registration of.veth IDs is priced to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity. All fees, except for the 1 VRSC import fee that goes into the mining and staking fee pool, go to the bridge converter liquidity basket.\n\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with the testnet, and now I want to start fresh. How can I reset my testnet in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo reset your testnet, make sure Verus is closed and no testnet daemon is running. Then, delete the following directories and restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native).",
