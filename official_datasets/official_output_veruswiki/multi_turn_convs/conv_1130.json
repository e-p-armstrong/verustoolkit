    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about private, internal blockchains in Verus. Can you explain what that means and how they interact with public currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, private, internal blockchains are blockchains that are easy to set up and can be bridged to public currencies, allowing for the transfer of assets between the public chain and the internal private network. These internal blockchains have all the features and currencies of the public chain but with restricted access. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on the Verus network, with some overhead for cross-notarization.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I was also wondering about time locks. How can I lock an ID with a time lock in Verus, and what does the timelock parameter define?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo lock an ID with a time lock in Verus, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter. The `timelock` parameter defines the unlock height of the identity, which is the block height at which the ID will be unlocked.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What about when setting flags to an unlocked state? What is the purpose of the `timelock` parameter then, and how does it differ from the time lock?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen setting flags to an unlocked state, the `timelock` parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock. This is different from the time lock, which defines the unlock height of the identity. The time delay is used to specify a delay before the ID can be unlocked after the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What happens to a locked identity if it is revoked, and can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a locked identity is revoked, its locked status will be cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height. Additionally, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. What is the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus is used to retrieve all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example, the command `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
