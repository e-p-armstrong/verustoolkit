    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a raw transaction using the Verus CLI-interface. Can you walk me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a raw transaction, you can use the `createrawtransaction` command in the Verus CLI-interface. The basic format of the command is:\n```\nrun createrawtransaction '[{\"txid\": \"yourtxid here\", \"vout\": fill in too}]' '{\"destination addr\": <amount>}' <current Blockheight -5>\n```\nYou will need to replace `yourtxid here` with the actual TXID, `fill in too` with the actual vout, `destination addr` with the actual destination address, `<amount>` with the actual amount, and `<current Blockheight -5>` with the current block height minus 5. Do you have any questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what should I keep in mind when adapting the `createrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! When adapting the `createrawtransaction` command, make sure to subtract the 0.0001 VRSC free from the amount that is in the original TXID. This is because the 0.0001 VRSC is a fee that is deducted from the transaction. Did you understand that part?\n\n**User:**\nYes, got it! So what's the result of running the `createrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of running the `createrawtransaction` command is a long HEX-string that represents the raw transaction. This string will need to be copied and used in the next step of the process. Don't forget to copy the entire string!\n\n**User:**\nI found a tutorial that provides an example command and its result. Can I use those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the example command and its result provided in the text are only examples and should not be used. You should use the results from your own wallet when running the `createrawtransaction` command. The examples are meant to guide you, but you need to generate your own raw transaction using your own wallet data.",
