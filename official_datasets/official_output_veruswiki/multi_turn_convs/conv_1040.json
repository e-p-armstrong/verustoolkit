    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got Verus set up on my machine, but I'm not entirely sure if everything is working as it should. How do I know when the Verus Daemon is operational and mining is working correctly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOnce the Verus Daemon is operational, you'll see a message indicating that mining is working correctly, such as \"256 mega hashes complete - working\". This indicates that the daemon is successfully generating blocks and mining is operational. If you see this message, you can be confident that everything is up and running smoothly.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks for the help! I've got one more question. I'm running the daemon in Tmux, but I'm not sure how to detach from the process. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo detach from the Verus Daemon process in Tmux, press `[ctrl]&b d`. This will detach you from the process, allowing you to continue using your terminal while the daemon runs in the background. You can then close your terminal or move on to other tasks without interrupting the daemon's operation. Give it a try!",
