    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the warranty and guarantee provided with the Verus software. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that there is no guarantee of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Just something to keep in mind before using the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What about liability? Are the authors or copyright holders of the Verus software liable for any issues that may arise?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders of the Verus software are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've noticed that my antivirus software flags the Verus software as malicious or suspicious. Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software. This is a warning that the software may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC for mining purposes.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. How can I learn more about these false positive warnings from my antivirus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can review the following resources to learn more about the false positive warnings from your antivirus software:\n* https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/\n* https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/\n\n**User:**\nAre there any resources available to verify the safety of the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can verify the safety of the Verus software by checking the VirusTotal detection results for the different versions of the software. Here are the links:\n* MacOS: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3f1b2713bd7ba9ab01af59834a90720c734e773a9f73cd095a79248cc5a72b28/detection\n* Linux-x86-64: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4ef4dbc1f81acb454ba27427e05bbee552b519de3564c4485b36349966c70c81/detection\n* Linux-ARM64: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/cee56134a3ae6ad6319405b8e058aa0ca650bfccb69436a84888a50fd5892abb/detection\n* Windows: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/5a2e3252f67198cc7b4a247621dd1c8d3d5ecf1d218b2142fa08f8b52cd6c611/detection\n\nThese resources should help you verify the safety of the Verus software.",
