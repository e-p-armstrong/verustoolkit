    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves a list of currencies that meet certain liquidity and reserve ratio requirements. Specifically, it returns currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, a reserve ratio greater than 10%, and have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! How can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies with specific markets?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies with specific markets by specifying the markets as arguments. For example, to find currencies with BTC/ETH markets, you can run the command:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\n\nThis will return a list of currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So what are the conditions for a currency to be included in the results of the `getcurrencyconverters` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA currency must meet the following conditions to be included in the results of the `getcurrencyconverters` API:\n\n1. It must have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve.\n2. It must have a reserve ratio greater than 10%.\n3. It must have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\nThese conditions ensure that the currencies returned by the API have sufficient liquidity and reserves to facilitate reliable conversions.",
