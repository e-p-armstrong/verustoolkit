    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in launching a currency on Verus. What are the requirements to initiate a currency launch on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo initiate a currency launch on Verus, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST. Additionally, 1000 VRSCTEST must be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. This process happens as part of the mining process, and the miners who participate in the launch earn a 0.025% conversion fee. Are you planning to launch a currency on Verus? I can help you with the process if you need it.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. How can I convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can park your conversion until the GOLD token launches by sending a command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the launch block. The command would look like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back. Have you tried this command before, or do you need more help with it?\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to my VRSCTEST if the GOLD token launch is unsuccessful?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the GOLD token launch is unsuccessful, you will have your VRSCTEST back. The conversion will be reversed, and you will not lose your VRSCTEST. You don't have to worry about losing your VRSCTEST in case the launch doesn't go as planned. Does that make you feel more confident about launching a currency on Verus?",
