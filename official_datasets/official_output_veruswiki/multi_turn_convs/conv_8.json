    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get a better understanding of my Verus node's connections. What information does the `getpeerinfo` command provide about the peers connected to my Verus node?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getpeerinfo` command provides a list of objects, each containing information about a peer connected to your Verus node. This information includes:\n\n* The peer's index, address, and local address\n* The services offered by the peer\n* The times of the last send and receive, as well as the total bytes sent and received\n* The connection time and time offset\n* The peer's version and subversion\n* Whether the connection is inbound or outbound\n* The starting height of the peer\n* The ban score\n* The last header and block in common with the peer\n* The heights of blocks currently being requested from the peer\n\nThis information can be useful for monitoring and troubleshooting your node's connections.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks! How can I use the `getpeerinfo` command to get information about my Verus node's peers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getpeerinfo` command in two ways:\n\n1. Using the Verus command-line interface: `verus getpeerinfo`\n2. Using the JSON-RPC API: `curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getpeerinfo\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`\n\nBoth methods will return a list of objects containing information about the peers connected to your Verus node. Just make sure to replace `myusername` with your actual username, and `http://127.0.0.1:27486/` with your node's actual JSON-RPC API address.",
