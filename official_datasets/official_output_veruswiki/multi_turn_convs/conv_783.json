    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few questions about how Verus works. What happens to contributions made to a chain if the minimum contributions are not met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start, and all contributions will be refunded to the original contributors. So, don't worry about losing your contributions if the minimum isn't met. Do you have any other questions about chain contributions?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. How does the initial price in reserve at chain launch affect the currency's price?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe initial price in reserve at chain launch starts at 1.0, but fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency will cause the currency's price to rise or fall. The volatility of the price change is inversely related to the reserve ratio. So, the higher the reserve ratio, the less volatile the price change will be. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, it does. That leads me to my next question. What is the relationship between a currency's reserve ratio and its price volatility?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great follow-up question! A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve. A currency with a lower reserve ratio (e.g., 0.1 or 10%) will rise or fall more quickly when converted to or from, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit. So, the lower the reserve ratio, the more volatile the price changes will be.\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand. Now, I want to know how to connect to a defined chain using the command line.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can connect to a defined chain using the command line by running:\n```\n./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\nThis will create a local config file on first connection, and you won't need to run VRSCTEST to connect again. However, VRSCTEST is still needed for merge mining. Does that help?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that does. One more question: Where are the config files for PBaaS chains stored?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe config files for PBaaS chains are stored in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME` directory, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain. The presence of a correct config file enables the chain to load as an independent chain.",

            "The example above defines a chain that emits a premine to the indicated address and also converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price.

If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.The initial price in reserve at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the early blocks that will come in as reserve currency. All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve.
