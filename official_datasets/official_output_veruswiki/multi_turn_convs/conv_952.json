    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to use Verus software, but my antivirus software, Avast, keeps flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question! Verus software may be flagged as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) by antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky because it includes mining software, which could be used by a third party to exploit a PC. This is a false positive warning, and Verus is not malicious software.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for clarifying that. I did notice that the Verus software I downloaded was a test release. What does that mean, exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis Verus software is a test release, intended for use with test chains. The warning is that it should not be used as a main wallet for actual transactions. It's meant for testing purposes only.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I'm actually trying to define a new chain using the `definechain` command. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a new chain, you can use the `definechain` command with the following format:\n\n```\n./komodo-cli -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [{\"reward\" : 10000000000}], \"notarizationreward\" : 1440000000, \"billingperiod\" : 1440, \"nodes\" : [{\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2500\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"\"}, {\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2501\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"RDyDzC5JB66Y29fzBkamywqEn1PJXTzj8B\"}]}'\n```\n\nThis will help you define a new chain.\n\n**User:**\nWhat are the minimum requirements for a chain definition, by the way?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum requirements for a chain definition are:\n\n1. A maximum of 3 eras.\n2. At least 500 blocks worth of notarizations.\n3. A minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.\n4. VRSCTEST must be present in the wallet to make a chain.\n\nKeep those in mind when creating your chain.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! Once I've created my chain, how do I connect to it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo connect to a defined chain, you can use the following command:\n\n```\n./komodod -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\n\nThis will create a local config file, which allows you to connect to the chain without needing to run VRSCTEST. However, VRSCTEST is still needed to merge mine.",
