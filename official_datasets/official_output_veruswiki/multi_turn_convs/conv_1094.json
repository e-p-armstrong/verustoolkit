    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to set up pool-mining on Windows, but I'm worried about it interfering with other processes running on my PC. Do you have any advice on how to do this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI totally understand your concern! To set up pool-mining on Windows without interfering with other processes, you can deprioritize the mining process. This will result in your miner throttling down whenever your PC needs processing power. You can do this by adjusting the batch file of your mining software to run on low priority. This method has been tested with Verus NHEQminer and Verus CCMiner on Windows 10.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a great solution! But I'm not sure how to adjust the batch file of NHEQminer to run on low priority. Can you walk me through the steps?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo adjust the batch file of NHEQminer to run on low priority, follow these steps:\n\n1. Change to the folder where you extracted the NHEQminer download.\n2. Edit the `start.bat` file.\n3. Scroll down to the line that needs to be adjusted, which starts with `nheqminer.exe`.\n4. Adjust the line to include the `/Low` priority flag, like this: `%windir%\\system32\\cmd.exe /c start \"NHEQminer VRSC\" /Low \"%THIS_DIR%\\nheqminer.exe\" -v -l %PoolHost%:%Port% -u %PublicVerusCoinAddress%.%WorkerName% -t %Threads% %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9`\n5. Save and exit the file.\n6. Run `start.bat` to start mining.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I'm curious, what's the purpose of deprioritizing the mining process on Windows?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of deprioritizing the mining process on Windows is to prevent the miner from interfering with other processes running on your PC. By running the miner on low priority, it will throttle down whenever your PC needs processing power, allowing you to use CPU-heavy applications like games without the miner interfering.",
