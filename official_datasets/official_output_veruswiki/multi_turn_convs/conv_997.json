    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been having some trouble with the Verus test network. I've been having issues syncing to the network and performing cross-chain operations. Will this upgrade (v0.9.9) fix these issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, this upgrade (v0.9.9) should fix all known testnet issues, including difficulties with syncing and performing cross-chain operations. You should be able to fully sync to the network and resume cross-chain operations without any issues. \n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I was wondering, what happened on the testnet that caused these issues in the first place?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSomeone mined with an intermediate version of the daemon on the testnet, which made the network unavailable without a bootstrap on the older daemon. This upgrade (v0.9.9) should fix this issue. \n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. Will I be able to perform witnessed cross-chain operations on the testnet after this upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, this upgrade should enable you to resume witnessed cross-chain operations on the testnet, even if you were having difficulties previously.",

As mentioned, someone seems to have mined with an intermediate version along the way on testnet and made the network unavailable without a bootstrap on the older daemon. This version should fix that issue as well as any cross-chain difficulties. Auto-notarization will be enabled on testnet in sync when the testfork executes. Until then, all witnessed cross-chain operations should be able to resume, if they have had difficulty. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**",
