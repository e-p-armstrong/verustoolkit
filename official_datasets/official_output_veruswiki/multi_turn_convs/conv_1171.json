    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus. Can you tell me what it's used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API is used to send and convert funds in Verus. It's a powerful tool for managing your digital assets. Do you have a specific use case in mind, or would you like some examples of how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that would be great. How do I send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nJust replace \"bob@\" with the sender's address, \"alice@\" with the recipient's address, and 10 with the amount of VRSCTEST to be sent. Easy peasy!\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I want to send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients using the `sendcurrency` API? How would I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":1}]'\n```\nJust replace \"alice@:private\" and \"bob@:private\" with the recipients' friendly-name z-addresses, and 10 and 1 with the amounts of VRSCTEST to be sent to each recipient, respectively.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question, what happens to testnet coins/currencies when VRSCTEST is reset?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. So, be sure to use them for testing purposes only, and don't get too attached!",
