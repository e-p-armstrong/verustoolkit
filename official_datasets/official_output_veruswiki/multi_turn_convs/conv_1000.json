    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm a bit concerned about using the Verus software. What kind of warranty or guarantee does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that there are no warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-INFRINGEMENT. It's essential to understand that the software is provided without any guarantees, and you should use it at your own risk.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a bit concerning. What kind of liability do the authors or copyright holders of the Verus software have?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe authors or copyright holders of the Verus software shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. This means that the authors and copyright holders are not responsible for any damages or losses you might incur while using the software.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I'm still a bit concerned about the safety of the Verus software. Are there any resources I can check to verify its legitimacy?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can check the VirusTotal website for detection results of the Verus software on different platforms (MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows). These links provide information on the software's safety and legitimacy. You can also check other online resources and forums to see what other users are saying about the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've noticed that some antivirus software, like Avast and Kaspersky, flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is flagged as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) by some antivirus software because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can learn more about it from resources like Malwarebytes and Kaspersky's blogs. It's essential to understand that this flagging is not because the software is malicious, but because it can be used for malicious purposes if installed without your knowledge or consent.",
