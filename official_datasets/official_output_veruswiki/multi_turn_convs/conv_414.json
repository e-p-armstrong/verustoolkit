How can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` command to find currencies that have markets for BTC and ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` command to find currencies that have markets for BTC and ETH by running the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis command will return a list of currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.
