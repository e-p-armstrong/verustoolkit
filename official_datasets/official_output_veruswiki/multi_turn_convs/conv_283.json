    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there, I've been playing around with Verus and I've got a question about signature verification. What does it mean if the result of a signature verification is \"true\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the result of a signature verification is \"true\", it means that the signature is valid. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks! I've also been following the updates to Verus, and I was wondering about the v0.7.1-5 release. What's the main purpose of that release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main purpose of the v0.7.1-5 release of Verus is to provide fixes necessary to continue participating in the testnet launched in v0.7.1-1 without resetting the wallet or holdings. It is compatible with mainnet with minimal changes from v0.7.1-1. This release is meant to help keep everything running smoothly.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the Verus Testnet, but I'm not entirely sure what it is. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Testnet with Multi-currency Fractional Reserves and Currency Launch Protocol is a technology preview that offers UTXO-based, fractional reserve currencies with anti-front running, simultaneously solved, provably fair liquidity system for all currencies and tokens in or imported into the PBaaS system. It's a way to test and preview some of the new features and technologies that Verus is working on.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. I've also heard that the \"sendcurrency\" API has been updated on the Verus Testnet. What are the new features of that API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn the Verus Testnet, the \"sendcurrency\" API has been enhanced with new multi-currency parameters. These parameters include \"currency\":\"currencyname\", which specifies the source currency of the send, and \"convertto\":\"currencyname\", which allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source. This allows for more flexibility and control when sending currencies.",
