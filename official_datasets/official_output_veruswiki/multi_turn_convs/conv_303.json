    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about currencies on Verus. How can currencies be launched on Verus, and what features can they have?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrencies on Verus can be launched to accept a range of other currencies, and can be created with or without fractional reserve capabilities. Additionally, the Verus import/export protocol allows for easy integration with other blockchains, making it possible to send and receive tokens between Verus and other chains, such as ETH/ERC20 tokens. This gives a lot of flexibility and possibilities for currency creators. Do you have any plans to launch a currency on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I've been experimenting with the testnet, VRSCTEST. What happens to testnet coins/currencies when VRSCTEST is reset?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question to ask. All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. This means that any currencies or coins created on the testnet will be lost when the testnet is reset. So, it's important to keep that in mind when experimenting with the testnet. It's meant for testing and development, not for storing value. Does that make sense?",

Verus import/export protocol was designed to make integration with other block chains provable and easy, and there are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, where currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network, and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.# Preparing for Multi-chain, Dynamic Merge Mining\nWhile this 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology which was running on testnet last year. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously.
