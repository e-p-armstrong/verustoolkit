    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about Verus, specifically about using it with older versions. What should I do if I have used Testnet with versions prior to v0.9.2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have used Testnet with versions prior to v0.9.2, you should delete and clear any existing Testnet data folders to ensure a smooth transition to v0.9.2. This will help prevent any potential issues or conflicts.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks! I've also heard that v0.9.2 brings some new features. What's new for identity creation in v0.9.2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn v0.9.2, enhanced privacy features for identity creation are available for both Mainnet and Testnet. This is a significant improvement, and I'm sure you'll appreciate the added privacy features.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! What's next for the core developers of Verus after v0.9.2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter v0.9.2, the core developer focus is on protocol hardening, enabling usage, and then upgrading the user experience. They will also work on supporting infrastructure, such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile, and web extension wallets, as well as merge mining for pool servers.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that Verus Desktop v0.9.2 has some new features. What's new in Verus Desktop v0.9.2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus Desktop v0.9.2, a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer is available, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on-chain and cross-chain. This visualizer can be accessed by clicking on \"Visualize Network\" on the Metaverse tab. It's a really cool feature that helps you visualize the complexity of the network.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I've got a question about the new Verus testnet. What PBaaS capabilities are available on the new testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll PBaaS capabilities, including those for application development, are available on the new Verus testnet. The goal is to achieve interoperability, with the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge being launched soon. This is an exciting development, and I'm sure it will open up new possibilities for developers and users alike.",
