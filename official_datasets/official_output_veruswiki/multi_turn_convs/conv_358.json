    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a few questions about PBaaS chains and the Verus Desktop. What's a limitation of using PBaaS chains with currencies that are already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata and will be addressed in future releases.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What about the warranty or guarantee that comes with using this experimental software? Should I be worried about anything?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. So, use at your own risk, basically.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What kind of permissions do I have as a user of this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPermission is granted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so, subject to the conditions that the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. So, you have quite a bit of flexibility in how you use the software.",
