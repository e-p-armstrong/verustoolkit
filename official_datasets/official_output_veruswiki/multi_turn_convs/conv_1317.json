    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to create a new currency on Verus and I've got a question about the `proofprotocol` setting. What does it mean to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new currency, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about `proofprotocol` or creating a new currency on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! Now I'm wondering, how can I mint new coins in a currency I've defined with `proofprotocol` set to 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins in a currency with `proofprotocol` set to 2, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis will mint 10,000 new coins in the \"mycoin\" currency and send them to the address \"mike@\". Just replace \"mycoin\" and \"mike@\" with your own currency and address, of course! Do you have any more questions about minting new coins or using the `sendcurrency` command?",
