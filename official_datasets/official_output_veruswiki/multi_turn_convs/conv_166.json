    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring Verus Vault's capabilities, and I'm curious about its time-locking feature. What are some potential use cases for Verus Vault's time-locking capability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault's time-locking capability can be used for a variety of purposes, including providing time-locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured to provide time-locked deal and payment terms. It can also be used for theft resistance and delayed lock opening. The technology has many potential uses beyond these examples, and its applications are still being explored. Do you have any specific use cases in mind that you'd like to discuss?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes! I'm interested in updating an identity to have a time lock using the `updateidentity` command. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo update an identity to have a time lock, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter. The `timelock` parameter defines the unlock height of the identity. Here's an example command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nMake sure to replace `<Unlock block height>` with the actual block height you want the identity to unlock at.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, but what's the difference between the `timelock` parameter in the `updateidentity` command when `flags` is set to 0 versus when `flags` is set to 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `flags` is set to 0, the `timelock` parameter defines the unlock height of the identity. When `flags` is set to 2, the `timelock` parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! What happens to a locked identity when it is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRevoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. So, if you revoke a locked identity, it will no longer be locked.\n\n**User:**\nCan a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. You'll need to use a different identity or mechanism to revoke a locked identity.\n\n**User:**\nMoving on to a different topic, what does the `getcurrencyconverters` API do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example, `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, what should I keep in mind when working with testnet coins and currencies on VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou should keep in mind that all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. So, don't get too attached to your testnet assets!",
