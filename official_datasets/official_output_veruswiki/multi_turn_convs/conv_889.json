    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a few questions about Verus. How can I get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block by running the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate\n```\nThis should give you the information you're looking for. Do you have any other questions about this or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How can I get currency statistics for a specific block using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get currency statistics for a specific block by running the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\nJust replace `blocknum` with the number of the block for which you want to get the statistics. Easy peasy!\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I want to get currency statistics for a range of blocks with a specific period between them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get currency statistics for a range of blocks with a specific period between them by running the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```\nJust replace `startblocknum` with the number of the starting block, `endblocknum` with the number of the ending block, and `blockstostep` with the number of blocks to step between each statistics point.\n\n**User:**\nBefore I start using Verus, I just want to know... what's the status of the software provided by Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software provided by Verus is experimental and unfinished. It is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Just keep that in mind as you use Verus.",
