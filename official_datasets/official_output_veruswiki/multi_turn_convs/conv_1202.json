    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into creating an identity on the Verus network, and I was wondering, how are the fees distributed when creating an identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen creating an identity on the Verus network, the fees are distributed as follows:\n\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined\n\nThe remaining funds, not paid to referrers, go to miners or stakers of the blockchain. So, it's a decentralized way of rewarding those who participate in the network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What happens to the majority of the funds when creating an identity on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n100% of all funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain. So, the majority of the funds are actually distributed to those who help maintain the network, which is a key aspect of decentralized systems like Verus.",
