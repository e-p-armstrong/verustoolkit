    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a few more questions about VerusIDs. How do they handle changes to the controlling addresses or single/multi-sig properties?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the controlling addresses or single/multi-sig properties of a VerusID are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity will follow the updated spend conditions and be subject to the updated keys. This ensures that the identity remains flexible and adaptable to changing needs.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great. I'm also concerned about security. Are VerusIDs resistant to quantum attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, VerusIDs are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms. Additionally, Verus is integrating a quantum secure signature scheme, which will make it possible to change an ID and have all funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. This future-proofs Verus against potential quantum threats.\n\n**User:**\nWhat else can VerusIDs be used for besides sending and receiving funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains. However, only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs. This feature expands the versatility of VerusIDs beyond just transactions.\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the underlying nature of the VerusID protocol. What's its nature?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusID protocol is fully decentralized, allowing anyone to create an ID and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without permission. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. This decentralized approach ensures that VerusIDs are community-driven and not controlled by a central authority.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question: what is the revocation authority in a VerusID, and what is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe revocation authority in a VerusID is an authority that has the permission to revoke the identity. By default, this authority is the identity itself. If the revocation authority revokes the identity, it creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds. This can be useful in cases such as key theft.",
