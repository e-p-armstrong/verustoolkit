    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `merge` command in Verus, but I'm not sure what arguments I need to provide. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required arguments when using the `merge` command in Verus are `fromaddresses` and `toaddress`. `fromaddresses` is a JSON array with addresses, and `toaddress` is the t-addr or zaddr to send the funds to. Do you have any questions about these arguments, or would you like to know more about the optional arguments?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do have a question about `fromaddresses`. What special strings can be used inside the `fromaddresses` array, and what do they do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe special strings \"ANY_TADDR\", \"ANY_SPROUT\", and \"ANY_SAPLING\" can be used inside the `fromaddresses` array. These strings allow you to merge UTXOs or notes from all t-addrs, Sprout zaddrs, or Sapling zaddrs belonging to the wallet, respectively.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. Can I use a combination of addresses and special strings in the `fromaddresses` array?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use a combination of addresses and special strings in the `fromaddresses` array. However, you cannot send funds from both Sprout and Sapling addresses simultaneously.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the `fee` argument? What's its purpose, and what's its default value?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `fee` argument specifies the fee amount to attach to the transaction. Its default value is 0.0001.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the `transparent_limit` and `shielded_limit` arguments? What do they control, and what are their default values?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `transparent_limit` argument controls the maximum number of UTXOs to merge, and its default value is 50. The `shielded_limit` argument controls the maximum number of notes to merge, and its default value is 20 for Sprout notes and 200 for Sapling notes.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question: what's the purpose of the `memo` argument, and how is it encoded?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `memo` argument allows you to store a memo field in the new note when sending funds to a zaddr. The memo is encoded as hex.",
