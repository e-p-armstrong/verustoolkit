    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm exploring the features of Verus Vault and I was wondering, what are some potential use cases for the time-locking capability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault's time-locking capability has a range of potential use cases. For instance, it can be used to provide time-locked funds to team members, children, employees, or even for structuring deal and payment terms. It can also be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. Do you have any specific scenarios in mind where you'd like to use time-locking?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds useful. How do I set a time lock on an identity using the Verus command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo set a time lock on an identity, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter. The `timelock` parameter defines the unlock height of the identity. Here's an example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nJust replace `<Unlock block height>` with the block height at which you want the identity to unlock.\n\n**User:**\nI'm still trying to wrap my head around time locking. What's the difference between a time lock and a time delay in Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA time lock defines the unlock height of an identity, whereas a time delay defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. Think of it like this: a time lock sets a specific block height for unlocking, while a time delay adds a pause before unlocking.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a locked identity when it is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRevoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. However, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. So, if you revoke a locked identity, it will no longer be locked, but it can't revoke itself while it's still locked.\n\n**User:**\nI've been exploring the Verus API and I stumbled upon `getcurrencyconverters`. What's the purpose of this API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example, you can use it to find all currencies that have a BTC/ETH market at or above the liquidity threshold:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis can be helpful for finding currencies with sufficient liquidity for trading.\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with testnet coins and currencies on VRSCTEST. Are there any gotchas I should keep in mind?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, definitely! All testnet coins and currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. So, don't get too attached to your testnet assets \u2013 they're just for testing and experimentation!",
