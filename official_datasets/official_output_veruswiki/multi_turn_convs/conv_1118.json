    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about the latest Verus release, and I'm curious about some of the changes. What was the main focus of the testnet reset in the latest Verus release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main focus of the testnet reset was to fix all reported issues related to PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID user issues. Users who reported issues are encouraged to verify that their issues have been addressed in this release.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear. I've also heard about the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge. What is it, and what's its current status?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge is a feature that allows for the transfer of assets between the Verus network and the Ethereum network. It has been testing on private networks and is expected to be launched on the mainnet soon, pending vetting by community test volunteers on the release testing network.\n\n**User:**\nI've also come across something called `getvdxfid` RPC call. What is it, and what's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getvdxfid` RPC call is a new feature that allows users to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys using their ID and published names. This feature has been used to create self-sovereign, decentralized, rent-free, and non-cancelable social media profiles.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What is VDXF, and how is it used in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVDXF stands for Verus Data eXchange Format. It is a format used to generate keys that enable self-sovereign, decentralized, rent-free, and non-cancelable user experiences, applications, and businesses. VDXF keys are used to create profiles, and the process of setting up these profiles is currently being documented.\n\n**User:**\nI've also noticed that additional ERC20 currencies were added to the latest software update. Why was that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAdditional ERC20 currencies were added to the latest software update in anticipation of more usage after the release of the ETH bridge.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question: I've heard that there was a fix implemented in the GUI regarding calculated balances of specific addresses. What was that about?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA fix was implemented in the GUI to correct an issue where calculated balances of specific addresses were sometimes showing lower than actual, even though the wallet balance displayed correctly.",
