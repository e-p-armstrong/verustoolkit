    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI need some help managing my wallet transactions in Verus. How can I prune spent wallet transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can prune spent wallet transactions in Verus using the `prunespentwallettransactions` command. This command can be used in different ways, such as:\n\n* `verus prunespentwallettransactions` to prune all spent transactions\n* `verus prunespentwallettransactions \"1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d\"` to prune a specific transaction\n* Using the JSON-RPC API with `curl` to prune all or specific transactions\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions about pruning transactions or if there's anything else I can help you with!\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do have another question. What is the purpose of the `rescanfromheight` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `rescanfromheight` command in Verus is used to rescan the current wallet from a specified height. This command can take a long time to complete, especially for large wallets. It can be used to rescan the entire chain or from a specific block height.\n\nIf you have any more questions about the `rescanfromheight` command or need help with something else, feel free to ask!\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. How can I re-broadcast unconfirmed wallet transactions to all peers in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can re-broadcast unconfirmed wallet transactions to all peers in Verus using the `resendwallettransactions` command. This command is intended for testing purposes only, as the wallet code periodically re-broadcasts automatically.\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance or have any more questions!\n\n**User:**\nI noticed an old command in the documentation, `sendfrom`. What is it used for, and is it still supported?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendfrom` command in Verus is used to send an amount from an account to a VRSC address. However, it is deprecated and should not be used. Instead, the `sendtoaddress` command should be used for this purpose.\n\nSo, to summarize, `sendfrom` is no longer supported and has been replaced by `sendtoaddress`. If you have any more questions or need help with something else, I'm here to assist you!",
