    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a few more questions about VerusIDs and currencies. How can currencies with a proof protocol of 2 issue IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrencies with a proof protocol of 2 can issue IDs in a decentralized operation, or in the case of centralized currencies, sell IDs using their own currency as the payment currency. This can be done with options for price, referrals, and permission from the currency identity required, which means the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How is ID registration paid for in fully decentralized fractional currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, which reduces the supply and raises the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves.\n\n**User:**\nInteresting. Can the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies be set in a reserve currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves, such as USDC or DAI.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the benefit of paying more than the minimum price for ID registration in fractional currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPaying more than the minimum price for ID registration in fractional currencies may also include VDXF key and contract bindings, which allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.\n\n**User:**\nHow does referral support work for ID registration fees in currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach currency can have multiple levels of referral support (up to 5 levels), which means that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred, and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies or sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.",
