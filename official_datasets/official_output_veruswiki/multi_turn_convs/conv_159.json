    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in using Verus, but I'm concerned about the warranty and liability of the software. What kind of warranty or liability does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI completely understand your concern. The Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Additionally, the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. It's essential to understand this before installing and using Verus. Do you have any other questions about this?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for clarifying that. I did run into an issue when trying to install Verus, my antivirus software flagged it as a virus or malware. Why might my antivirus software flag the Verus software as a virus or malware?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program). This is because Verus is a mining software, and some antivirus programs may warn users about installing mining software, as it could potentially be used by third parties to exploit their PC. It's not necessarily a real threat, but rather a precautionary measure taken by the antivirus software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Where can I learn more about false positives from antivirus software when installing Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo learn more about false positives from antivirus software when installing Verus, you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky, such as blog posts on PUP-optional-bitcoinminer and \"not-a-virus\" warnings. These resources can provide more information on why antivirus software may flag Verus as a potential threat, and how to safely install and use the software. I recommend checking out their websites and blog posts for more information.",
