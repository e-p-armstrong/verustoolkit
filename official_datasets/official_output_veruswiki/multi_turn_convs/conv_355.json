    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to define a new currency in Verus and I'm not sure what the `proofprotocol` setting does. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `proofprotocol` setting determines how new coins are minted in a currency. In this case, setting `proofprotocol` to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID, means that the controller of the chain ID has the ability to mint new coins. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! So, how does the controller of the chain ID actually mint new coins in a currency with `proofprotocol` set to PROOF_CHAINID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe controller of the chain ID can mint new coins using the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option. For example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n\nThis command would mint 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and send them to the address \"mike@\". Do you have any more questions about minting new coins or defining a new currency in Verus?",
