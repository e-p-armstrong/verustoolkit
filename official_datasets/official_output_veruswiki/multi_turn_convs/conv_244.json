    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been learning a lot about Verus, but I still have some questions. What is Verus Fee Pooling technology, and how does it address concerns about blockchain security?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Fee Pooling technology is a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model that strengthens blockchain security. It preserves the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time. In this model, all fees from transactions in a block are gathered and added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees. The current block miner or staker then takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.\n\nThis approach addresses concerns about blockchain security by providing a more stable and sustainable incentive structure for miners and stakers, which in turn helps to maintain the integrity and security of the blockchain. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard about Verus Vault. What is Verus Vault, and what capabilities does it provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a capability introduced on the Verus testnet that provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management. It enables various use cases, such as trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, estate planning, and more. Verus Vault allows for advanced time locking of identities, which, when combined with the revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID, has immense ramifications.\n\nIn essence, Verus Vault provides a secure and flexible way to manage identities and assets, giving users more control and options for how they want to handle their digital assets. It's a powerful tool that can be used in a variety of scenarios, from simple asset management to complex trust and estate planning. Do you have any more questions about Verus Vault or its capabilities?",

            "- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
