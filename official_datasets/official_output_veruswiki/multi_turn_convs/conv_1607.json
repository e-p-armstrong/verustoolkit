    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring the features of Verus and I came across NFT mapped tokens. Can you tell me more about their purpose in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNFT mapped tokens in Verus allow you to define an Ethereum NFT as the token that controls revoke and recover for an ID. This enables the NFT to be sent from the Ethereum blockchain to the Verus blockchain, where it can be used to revoke and recover the ID that defined the token. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about NFT mapped tokens?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that helps clarify things. How can I use NFT mapped tokens to protect my Ethereum NFTs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use NFT mapped tokens to protect your Ethereum NFTs by binding them to a pseudonymous ID, which allows you to extend and publish more than just the NFT. Additionally, you can use VerusID's revoke and recover technology to add an extra layer of protection to your NFTs. This way, you can have more control over your NFTs and keep them safe.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've been thinking about tokenizing ID control in Verus. What are the requirements for defining a currency for tokenizing ID control in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a currency for tokenizing ID control in Verus, the currency definition must have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre-allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0. Does that help? Do you have any questions about how to implement this?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How can I define a currency for tokenizing ID control using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can define a currency for tokenizing ID control using the command line with the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```\nThis command defines a currency named \"ID\" with the required flags and settings for tokenizing ID control. Just run this command in your terminal and you should be good to go!",

            "NFT mapped tokens will allow you to define an Ethereum NFT as the token that controls revoke and recover for an ID. Similar to how you can define a token for tokenized ID control, an NFT mapped token, when defined, refers by contract and tokenid to a specific NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Once defined as the currency for a specific ID or sub-ID and linked to the Ethereum NFT, that NFT will be able to be sent over from the Ethereum blockchain as a satoshi of that currency, sent to any address or ID on the Verus blockchain, exchanged trustlessly on the Verus on-chain P2P marketplace, and used to revoke and recover the ID which defined the token. Once the contracts are updated, you will be able to mint NFTs on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet, and endow your Ethereum NFTs with all of the power of your specially named VerusID. This new technology allows you to protect your NFTs with VerusID\u2019s revoke and recover technology, bind your NFT to the pseudonymous ID you use to log into applications, use it to extend and publish much more than just the NFT, and generally take your Ethereum NFTs to the next level!The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release.
