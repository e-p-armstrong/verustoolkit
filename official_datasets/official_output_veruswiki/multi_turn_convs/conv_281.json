    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I just heard about the latest protocol update for Verus. What's included in it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe latest protocol update for Verus includes the first protocol release candidate for mainnet PBaaS, VerusID protocol upgrades, and Verus DeFi. It also includes functional fixes, full web site support for mapped currencies, and simple commands for mapping Verus currencies to any ERC20 currencies on Ethereum. Would you like me to explain any of those components in more detail?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I've heard about the Verus Proof of Power consensus algorithm parameter changes. What's the purpose of those changes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Proof of Power consensus algorithm parameter changes enable smoother starts, restarts, and general operation of PBaaS chains, regardless of their native currency supply or emission schedule. These changes should make the overall system more robust and efficient.\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in testing out the new features. What's required to access the v0.9.3 testnet after this update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo access the v0.9.3 testnet after this update, you need to reset your local testnet by deleting the vrsctest and pbaas data folders from the specified locations. That should get you set up to start testing the new features.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about the new Ethereum bridge. What's the purpose of that, and how does it relate to mapped currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Ethereum bridge enables full use of Ethereum mapped currencies on the Goerli Ethereum testnet. This makes it easy for any currency definition to become a fully decentralized, auditable stable coin, simply by mapping to DAI, USDT, USDC, or another stable coin on Ethereum. It opens up a lot of possibilities for creating new currencies and usage cases.\n\n**User:**\nHow do the website updates for Metamask support and use from Ethereum relate to mapped currency options?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe website updates for Metamask support and use from Ethereum now display all mapped currency options, even those added when someone exports a currency definition to Ethereum, either as a mapped currency or for using any Verus or PBaaS currency as an ERC20. This makes it easier to explore and utilize the various currency options available.",

In addition this new protocol upgrade changes some parameters of the Verus Proof of Power consensus algorithm, enabling smoother starts, restarts, and general operation of PBaaS chains, regardless of their native currency supply or emission schedule.
