    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the Verus API, and I'm not entirely sure what the `currencyconverters` API does. Can you explain its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `currencyconverters` API is used to retrieve all currencies that meet specific reserve requirements. These requirements include having at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, a reserve ratio of at least 10% VRSC, and having all listed currencies as reserves. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about the `currencyconverters` API?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, but how can I actually use the `currencyconverters` API to find currencies with specific markets? For example, if I want to find currencies that have markets for BTC and ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` command to find currencies that have markets for specific currencies. For example, the command `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold. This can be really useful for finding currencies that meet specific market requirements.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! One more question: what are the reserve requirements for a currency to be included in the results of the `currencyconverters` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo be included in the results of the `currencyconverters` API, a currency must have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve and a reserve ratio of at least 10% VRSC. Additionally, the currency must have all listed currencies as reserves. These requirements help ensure that the currencies returned by the API are reliable and have sufficient liquidity.",
