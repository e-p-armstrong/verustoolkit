    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use some advanced features in the Verus Coin wallet, but I'm not sure what version I need. What is the minimum version of the Verus Coin wallet that supports Sapling high-performance zero-knowledge transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum version of the Verus Coin wallet that supports Sapling high-performance zero-knowledge transactions is 0.4.0. Make sure you're running at least that version to take advantage of Sapling's features.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! I'm also interested in using Sapling compatible, transparent mobile transactions on the Verus Coin or Zcash networks. What do I need to make that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo use Sapling compatible, transparent mobile transactions on the Verus Coin or Zcash networks, you need Verus Enhanced Agama v 0.4.0c. That's the specific version of the wallet that supports Sapling mobile transactions.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of the \"Cheat Catcher\" feature in the Verus Coin wallet, but I'm not really sure what it does. Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"Cheat Catcher\" feature in the Verus Coin wallet is designed to earn money by catching stakers who are staking for rewards in a selfish way that does not contribute to converging the network on one blockchain. Miners and stakers who use it can protect the Verus Coin network and earn rewards. It's a way to help maintain the integrity of the network and get rewarded for doing so.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. How do I enable the \"Cheat Catcher\" feature in the Verus Coin wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable the \"Cheat Catcher\" feature, you need a Sapling z-address. You can either pass it in to the CLI wallet with the \"-cheatcatcher=zaddress\" option or add it in the Settings->App config of the enhanced Agama GUI. Once you've set that up, you're good to go!",
