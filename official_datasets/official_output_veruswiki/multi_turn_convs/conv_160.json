    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get a better understanding of my Verus wallet. How can I find out the total amount received by the default account in Verus, with at least one confirmation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getreceivedbyaccount` command to find out the total amount received by the default account in Verus, with at least one confirmation. The command is:\n```\nverus getreceivedbyaccount \"\"\n```\nThis will show you the total amount received by the default account with at least one confirmation.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful! What if I want to find out the total amount received by a specific account, let's say \"tabby\", in Verus, including unconfirmed amounts with zero confirmations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getreceivedbyaccount` command again, but this time specify the account name and set the `minconf` parameter to 0. The command is:\n```\nverus getreceivedbyaccount \"tabby\" 0\n```\nThis will show you the total amount received by the \"tabby\" account, including unconfirmed amounts with zero confirmations.\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I want to make sure the amounts are very safe, with at least 6 confirmations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the same command, but set the `minconf` parameter to 6. The command is:\n```\nverus getreceivedbyaccount \"tabby\" 6\n```\nThis will show you the total amount received by the \"tabby\" account, with at least 6 confirmations, which is considered very safe.\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I want to find out the total amount received by a specific VRSC address, let's say \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\", in Verus, with at least one confirmation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getreceivedbyaddress` command to find out the total amount received by a specific VRSC address. The command is:\n```\nverus getreceivedbyaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\"\n```\nThis will show you the total amount received by the specified VRSC address, with at least one confirmation.\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I want to get detailed information about a specific transaction, let's say \"txid\", in my Verus wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `gettransaction` command to find out detailed information about a specific transaction. The command is:\n```\nverus gettransaction \"txid\"\n```\nThis will show you detailed information about the specified transaction.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen the `minconf` parameter in some of the commands. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `minconf` parameter specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for a transaction to be included in the total amount received. If `minconf` is set to 0, unconfirmed transactions are included. If `minconf` is set to a higher number, only transactions with at least that many confirmations are included.",
