    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've got some questions about Verus. I've been noticing that my antivirus software, Avast, has been flagging the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question. Antivirus software may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it includes mining software, which can be used by third parties to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives. It's a common issue with cryptocurrency software, but rest assured that Verus is safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus software download, though? I want to make sure I'm getting it from a trusted source.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus software download, you can follow these steps: \n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can also use CLI examples to verify the file directly or using a checksum. The `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands can be used with the signer's identity (\"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\") to verify the signature. This ensures that the file has not been tampered with during transmission and that it comes from a trusted source.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in Verus, anyway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in Verus are used to verify the authenticity of a downloaded file or hash. They ensure that the file or hash has not been tampered with during transmission and that it comes from a trusted source. If the signature is valid, the command will return `true`. It's an extra layer of security to give you peace of mind when downloading and using Verus software.\n\n**User:**\nI heard there's a new CLI upgrade available, v0.7.2-5. What are some of the improvements and updates included in this upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe NON-MANDATORY CLI upgrade v0.7.2-5 includes fixes that only apply to the testnet, such as: \n\n* Fixing a testnet transaction funding issue for multi-currency `sendcurrency` commands\n* Fixing testnet currency conversions\n\nIt's a minor update, but it's always a good idea to stay up-to-date with the latest improvements and fixes.",
