    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm working with multi-currency in Verus and I was wondering if there are any limitations I should be aware of.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are a couple of limitations to keep in mind when working with multi-currency in Verus. Firstly, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. This can cause problems and is not supported, so it's recommended to avoid doing this.\n\nAdditionally, if you're using the GUI, you cannot use the same name as an existing supported currency (such as BTC or ETH) for a PBaaS chain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks! I'm curious, why is it not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCreating an ID with an i-address as its name can cause problems because an i-address is typically used to refer to a currency or identity based on its name registration. Using an i-address as an ID name can lead to confusion and errors in various situations. It's better to keep things separate and avoid potential issues.",

            "There are two main limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus:\n\n1. You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. This can cause problems and is not supported. It's recommended to avoid doing this.\n2. (Only applicable to the GUI) You cannot use the same name as an existing supported currency (such as BTC or ETH) for a PBaaS chain.",
            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain.
