    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in upgrading my VerusID to a quantum secure address, but I'm worried about my previous transactions. What happens to them if I upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you upgrade your VerusID to a quantum secure address, all previous transactions sent to your original identity name/address will be retroactively secured under the control of that address. This means that even if you had 1000 transactions sent to your original address, they will all be protected by the quantum secure address after the upgrade.\n\nSo, you don't have to worry about losing control over your previous transactions or compromising their security. The upgrade process will ensure that all your previous transactions are retroactively secured, giving you peace of mind and protection against potential quantum attacks. Does that answer your question?",
