    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new currency in Verus and I'm not sure about one of the settings. What does it mean to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. In other words, with `proofprotocol` set to 2, you'll have the ability to control the minting of new coins in your currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, how can I actually mint new coins in a currency that I've defined with `proofprotocol` set to 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. The format of the command is as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=<chain_name> sendcurrency \"<currency_id>@\" '[{\"address\":\"<recipient_address>@\",\"currency\":\"<currency_name>\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":<amount_to_mint}]'\n```\nJust replace `<chain_name>` with the name of the chain, `<currency_id>` with the ID of the currency, `<recipient_address>` with the address of the recipient, `<currency_name>` with the name of the currency, and `<amount_to_mint>` with the amount of coins to mint. This command will allow you to mint new coins in your currency.",
