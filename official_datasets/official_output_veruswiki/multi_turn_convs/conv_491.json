    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how the Verus network handles the creation of new IDs. How are the funds distributed when a new ID is created on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a new ID is created on the Verus network, the funds are distributed as follows:\n\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID\n* 20 VRSC to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined\n* 100% of all remaining funds go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.\n\nThis distribution ensures that everyone involved in the creation of a new ID is rewarded, from the referrers to the miners and stakers who maintain the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What happens to the majority of the funds involved in creating a new ID on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe majority of the funds involved in creating a new ID on the Verus network go to miners or stakers of the blockchain. They receive 100% of all remaining funds not paid to referrers. This incentivizes them to continue maintaining the blockchain and ensuring its integrity.\n\n**User:**\nWho benefits from the creation of a new ID on the Verus network, aside from the referrers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAside from the referrers, the miners or stakers of the blockchain benefit from the creation of a new ID on the Verus network. They receive 100% of all remaining funds not paid to referrers. This is a key aspect of the Verus network's design, as it rewards those who contribute to the network's maintenance and security.",
