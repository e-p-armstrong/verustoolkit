    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about VerusIDs and I'm interested in learning more about Verus Vault. What is Verus Vault, and how does it protect my funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a fantastic feature that offers an extra layer of security for your funds. Verus Vault is a feature that allows you to lock your VerusID, protecting your funds from being spent, even if your private key is stolen. While your VerusID is locked, you can still receive funds and stake them on the Verus network to earn rewards. However, you will not be able to spend those funds until the ID is unlocked.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! What are the requirements to enable Verus Vault capabilities, such as revocation, recovery, and locking of a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable Verus Vault capabilities, you need to have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This ensures that you have a clear system in place for managing and securing your VerusID.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. Can a locked VerusID be revoked and recovered, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, a locked VerusID can be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities. This circumvents the lock, allowing the authority identities to access the funds. However, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys, must first unlock the ID, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access the funds.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How does Verus Vault protect against the \"5-dollar wrench attack\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault provides a decentralized solution to the \"5-dollar wrench attack\" by allowing you to set a delay, such as 24 hours, between unlocking your ID and being able to spend or access the funds. This gives you, or a designated revocation authority, time to detect and respond to unauthorized unlock attempts, effectively preventing the attack.\n\n**User:**\nWhat additional features does Verus Vault provide beyond fund protection and recovery?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault also provides security for your IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. It's a powerful tool that offers a range of benefits beyond just protecting your funds.",

If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",
