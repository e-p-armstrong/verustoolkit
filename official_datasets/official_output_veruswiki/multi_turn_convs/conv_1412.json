    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about creating a new currency in Verus. What does the `proofprotocol` option do when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `proofprotocol` option determines the proof protocol used by the currency. In this example, it is set to 2, which corresponds to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID has the ability to mint new coins. Do you have any more questions about creating a new currency or the `proofprotocol` option?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, how can the controller of a chain ID mint new coins in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe controller of a chain ID can mint new coins by using the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option set to 1. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command would mint 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and send them to the address \"mike@\". Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about minting new coins or using the `sendcurrency` command?",
