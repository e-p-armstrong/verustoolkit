    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm getting more comfortable with the idea of VerusIDs, but I'm still not sure how to use them in practice. How can I buy and sell VerusIDs on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, directly advertising your offer to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. This allows for completely decentralized transactions, with the ability to pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address. It's a really flexible and secure way to buy and sell VerusIDs.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great. I've heard about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. What benefits does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace offers a decentralized platform for buying and selling VerusIDs and NFTs, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. It also allows for transparent or private transactions, with the ability to select and share proceeds with value-added agents or other participants. It's a great way to connect with others and make deals in a secure and transparent way.\n\n**User:**\nSecurity is a big concern for me. I've heard about Verus Vault. What is it, and how does it protect my funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows you to lock your VerusID, protecting your funds from theft, even if your private key is compromised. While your VerusID is locked, you cannot spend funds from that identity, but you can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. You can also still receive funds. It's an extra layer of protection for your assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really useful. What are the requirements for enabling Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable Verus Vault capabilities, including revocation, recovery, and locking your VerusID, you need to have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. It's a simple setup process, but it gives you a lot of peace of mind knowing that your funds are safe.",
