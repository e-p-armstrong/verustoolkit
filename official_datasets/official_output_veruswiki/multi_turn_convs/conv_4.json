    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about Verus Fee Pooling technology and I'm curious to know more. Can you tell me what it is and how it addresses concerns about blockchain security?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Fee Pooling technology is a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model that strengthens blockchain security while preserving the incentive to maximize per-block fees. In this model, all fees from transactions in a block are gathered and added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees. The current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool. This approach smooths fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, addressing concerns about blockchain security and fee distribution.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. How does Verus Fee Pooling technology differ from traditional fee models, and what benefits does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Fee Pooling technology differs from traditional fee models in that it pools all fees from transactions in a block and allows miners or stakers to take a percentage of the aggregate fee pool. This approach provides a more sustainable and equitable fee distribution model, ensuring that miners and stakers are incentivized to continue securing the blockchain while also smoothing out fee income over time.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about Verus Vault. Can you tell me what it is and what benefits it offers for identity management and other use cases?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a capability that provides advanced time locking of identities, enabling a theft-resistant workflow of identity management. It also enables various use cases such as trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, estate planning, and more. By combining Verus Vault with the revocation and recovery capabilities of VerusID, users can enjoy enhanced security and flexibility in managing their identities and assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a powerful tool. How does Verus Vault enhance the security and flexibility of identity management on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault enhances the security and flexibility of identity management on the Verus network by providing advanced time locking capabilities, allowing users to control access to their identities and assets over time. This feature, combined with VerusID's revocation and recovery capabilities, offers a robust and secure identity management system that protects users from theft and other security risks.",

In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
