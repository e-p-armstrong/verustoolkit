What does that indicate?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"recovered\" field in a Verus transaction is a boolean value that indicates whether the output is not for an address in the wallet. If it is set to true, it means the output is not for an address in the wallet.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about Verus transactions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
