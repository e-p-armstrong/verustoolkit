    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've heard about Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies, but I'm not entirely sure what they do or how they benefit users. Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi fractional basket currencies are a game-changer in the DeFi space. They allow ID owners to define currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. This has a number of benefits, particularly when it comes to addressing common DeFi issues.\n\n**User:**\nWhat kind of issues are we talking about here?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWell, one of the major problems in DeFi is miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. With Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies, all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This eliminates the opportunity for miners to extract value by reordering transactions or front-running, creating a more fair and transparent system.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a significant improvement. What else do these fractional basket currencies offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn addition to solving the MEV and front-running issues, Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies also provide fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers. This ensures smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities, which helps to maintain the health and security of the network.\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to understand the benefits. Can you summarize how Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies address common DeFi issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn short, Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies address common DeFi issues by eliminating miner extracted value and front-running, while also providing fee-based incentives to miners and stakers to ensure smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities. This creates a more fair, transparent, and secure DeFi ecosystem.",

            "ed on non-Verus systems.\n## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming\n - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets\n- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockcha",
