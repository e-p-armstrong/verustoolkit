    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use a multi-signature ID in Verus, but I'm not sure how to sign a transaction. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID in Verus, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using the `sendcurrency` command.\n2. Use the `z_getoperationstatus` command to get the raw hex transaction data.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n4. Use the `signrawtransaction` command to sign the raw transaction data in each wallet.\n5. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about these steps or need further clarification.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the new Verus testnet? What are its key features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers:\n\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Easy GUI for basic operations and command line for more advanced functions\n* Ability to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way\n\nThis testnet is a great way to explore the capabilities of Verus and get a feel for how it can be used in various scenarios.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds pretty powerful. What kind of flexibility does Verus offer in terms of creating and managing identities, currencies, and blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers a high degree of flexibility in creating and managing identities, currencies, and blockchains. You can create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming knowledge, and tailor them to your specific needs and use cases. This flexibility makes Verus a powerful platform for a wide range of applications, from personal use to business, government, and decentralized applications.\n\nWith Verus, you have the freedom to design and implement your own blockchain ecosystem, with the ability to customize and adapt it as needed. This flexibility is one of the key benefits of the Verus platform.",
