    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having some trouble using the `z_mergetoaddress` command. Can you explain what it does and what information it returns?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_mergetoaddress` command is used to merge UTXOs and notes to a specified address. It returns a JSON object with information about the merge operation, including the number of UTXOs and notes being merged, their values, and an operation ID to track the status of the operation. This can be really helpful for managing your digital assets and keeping your UTXOs organized. Do you have any experience with Verus, or is this your first time using the `z_mergetoaddress` command?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! So, how can I actually use the `z_mergetoaddress` command to merge UTXOs and notes to a specific address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_mergetoaddress` command by specifying the type of UTXOs or notes to merge, and the address to merge them to. For example, you can use the command `verus z_mergetoaddress '[\"ANY_SAPLING\", \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\"]' ztfaW34Gj9FrnGUEf833ywDVL62NWXBM81u6EQnM6VR45eYnXhwztecW1SjxA7JrmAXKJhxhj3vDNEpVCQoSvVoSpmbhtjf` to merge ANY_SAPLING UTXOs to the specified address. Just replace the example addresses and UTXO types with your own, and you're good to go!\n\n**User:**\nAnother thing I'm not quite clear on is the `z_sendmany` command. What's the purpose of that command, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_sendmany` command is used to send multiple transactions at once. It takes a from address, a list of recipient addresses and amounts, and optional minimum confirmation and fee parameters. The command sends the specified amounts to the recipient addresses, and returns change to the from address if necessary. Note that when sending coinbase UTXOs to a zaddr, change is not allowed, and the entire value of the UTXO(s) must be consumed. This can be really useful for managing multiple transactions in one go.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Are there any important considerations I should keep in mind when using the `z_sendmany` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are a few things to keep in mind. Before Sapling activates, the maximum number of zaddr outputs is 54 due to transaction size limits. Additionally, change generated from a taddr flows to a new taddr address, while change generated from a zaddr returns to itself. Just make sure to keep those limitations in mind when using `z_sendmany`, and you should be all set!",
