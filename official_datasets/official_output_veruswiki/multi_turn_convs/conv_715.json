    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a new currency on Verus. What are the requirements for launching a new currency on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a new currency on Verus, it must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST, and there must be 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specified rate (in this case, 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch. Make sure you meet these requirements before proceeding with your new currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. What happens during the mining process when a new currency is launched on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDuring the mining process, the blocks that launch a currency earn a 0.025% conversion fee for participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new currency. This is an incentive for miners to participate in the launch process.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, so I've launched my new currency. How can I convert VRSCTEST to a new currency (like GOLD) on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to a new currency by using the `sendcurrency` command with the `convertto` option. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, and you will either receive the converted amount or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful. One last question: how can I create a new token on Verus that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a new token on Verus that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST by using the `definecurrency` command with the specified options. The exact command will depend on the specific properties and conversion rates you want to set for your new token. Make sure to customize the command according to your needs.",
