    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there! I'm trying to install Verus Desktop and I'm wondering, where are the standard locations to install it, depending on whether I want to install it for all users or just myself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe standard locations to install Verus Desktop are:\n\n* For all users: `%ProgramFiles%\\Verus-Desktop`\n* For only myself: `%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Verus-Desktop`\n\nJust keep in mind that you might need administrative privileges to install for all users. Do you have any other questions about the installation process?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What should I be careful about when modifying files in the Verus Desktop installation folders?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou should be careful not to change files in the Verus Desktop installation folders or subfolders, as this may result in a corrupt installation. Only make changes when instructed by support community members. It's always a good idea to back up your files before making any changes, just in case. Do you have any questions about what kind of changes might be safe or necessary?\n\n**User:**\nWhere are the daemons located in the Verus Desktop installation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe daemons are located in the `komodod`, `verusd`, and `zcashd` folders, which can be found in the `resources\\app\\assets\\bin\\win64\\` subfolder of the installation folder. These daemons are responsible for communicating with the blockchain networks, so it's important to make sure they're running correctly. Do you have any questions about how to check if the daemons are running?\n\n**User:**\nWhere does Verus Desktop store its program settings?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Desktop stores its program settings in the `%AppData%\\Verus-Desktop` folder, with the user's settings stored in `appdata\\config.json` within that folder. If you need to reset or modify your settings, this is the place to look. Do you have any questions about what kind of settings you can modify?\n\n**User:**\nWhere are the standard locations for chain data and wallet storage for Verus and Komodo asset chains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe standard locations for chain data and wallet storage are:\n\n* For KMD: `%AppData%\\Komodo`\n* For Verus: `%AppData%\\Komodo\\VRSC`\n* For Komodo asset chains: `%AppData%\\Komodo\\<CHAIN-NAME>`, where `<CHAIN-NAME>` is the official name of the asset chain in uppercase.\n\nThese folders contain important data about your blockchain interactions, so make sure to back them up regularly. Do you have any questions about how to back up your chain data and wallet storage?\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. How can I easily access the binaries folders, Verus-Desktop program settings, and VRSC chain folder?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the debug menu in Verus-Desktop to easily access the binaries folders, Verus-Desktop program settings, and VRSC chain folder. Just navigate to the debug menu and look for the relevant options. This can save you a lot of time and hassle when you need to access these important folders.",
