    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard that the latest release of Verus has brought some significant enhancements to the cross-chain witness and notarization protocol. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe latest release has indeed introduced a significant enhancement to the cross-chain witness and notarization protocol. Now, any notarization to be confirmed must be first posted publicly, allowing for potential invalidity to be proven, before it is later confirmed. This change prevents potential attack vectors, such as stolen notary/witness keys combined with a secret 51% combined hash/stake attack.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a great improvement! What is the benefit of requiring notarizations to be posted publicly before confirmation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRequiring notarizations to be posted publicly before confirmation allows notaries to recognize and potentially refute invalid notarizations, such as those made with stolen keys. This adds an additional layer of security to the protocol, preventing potential attacks and ensuring the integrity of the network. By making notarizations public before confirmation, we can ensure that the network is more secure and resilient to potential attacks. Does that make sense?",
