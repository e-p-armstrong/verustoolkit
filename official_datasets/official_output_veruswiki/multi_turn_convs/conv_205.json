    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about Verus. Why do some antivirus software flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software. This is a warning that the software may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, these warnings are false positives, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false warnings. Don't worry, Verus is safe to use!\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Thanks for clarifying. Now, how can I verify the authenticity of my Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the authenticity of your Verus download by following these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nThe text file included with each download contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". This ensures that the download is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! What if I want to verify a Verus file directly using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify a Verus file directly using the command line with the following command:\n\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> /path/to/file.tar.gz\n```\n\nReplace `<signature>` with the actual signature from the text file, and `/path/to/file.tar.gz` with the actual path to the file you want to verify. This command will check the signature and ensure that the file is authentic.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what if I want to verify a Verus file using a checksum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify a Verus file using a checksum with the following command:\n\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <checksum>\n```\n\nReplace `<signature>` with the actual signature from the text file, and `<checksum>` with the actual checksum of the file you want to verify. This will compare the calculated checksum with the provided one, ensuring that the file is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.",
