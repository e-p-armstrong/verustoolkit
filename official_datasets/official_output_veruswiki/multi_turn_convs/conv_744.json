    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating a new chain on Verus. What are the requirements for doing so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a new chain on Verus, you need to meet the following requirements:\n\n1. A maximum of 3 eras can be defined for the chain.\n2. A minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations is required.\n3. Each block of notarization must be worth at least 0.01 VRSCTEST.\n\nAdditionally, you need to have VRSCTEST in your wallet to create a chain. Make sure you meet these requirements before attempting to create a new chain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I've also been looking at the chain definition, and I'm not sure what the `premine` field is for. Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `premine` field in a chain definition is used to specify the premine amount that will be emitted to a specific address at the launch of the chain. This allows you to allocate a certain amount of tokens to a specific address before the chain is open to the public.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! One more question: what happens if the minimum contributions are not met when creating a new chain on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the minimum contributions are not met when creating a new chain on Verus, the chain will fail to start, and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors. So, it's essential to ensure you meet the minimum contribution requirements to successfully launch your chain.",
