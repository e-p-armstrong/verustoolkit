    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there, I'm interested in launching a currency on the Verus network. What are the requirements for launching a currency on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a currency on the Verus network, it must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST, and have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specific rate (e.g., 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) before the launch can occur. This process is part of the mining process, and mining the blocks that launch a currency earns conversion fees. Do you have a specific currency in mind that you'd like to launch?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm thinking of launching a token called GOLD. How can I convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` command to park your conversion until the token launches. Here's an example command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned. Have you tried using this command before?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I haven't. But I'm curious, what happens to my funds if the currency launch is successful?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the currency launch is successful, you will receive the converted amount of the new token (e.g., GOLD) in your wallet. In the example above, you would receive 0.975 GOLD for every 100 VRSCTEST converted. So, you'll get the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, and you can use it as you like.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! I have one more question. How can I create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can define the token's properties using the `definecurrency` command. This will allow you to create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. You can specify the conversion rates and other properties of the token using this command. Do you need help with the exact syntax of the command?",
