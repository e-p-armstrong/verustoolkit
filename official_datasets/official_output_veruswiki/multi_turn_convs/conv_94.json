    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the Verus CLI commands and I'm not entirely sure what the `convertpassphrase` command does. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `convertpassphrase` command is used to retrieve information related to a Verus wallet, such as the address, public key, private key, and WIF (Wallet Import Format) private key, from a given wallet passphrase.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds useful! What kind of information can I expect to receive when using the `convertpassphrase` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using the `convertpassphrase` command, you can expect to receive a JSON object containing the following information:\n\n* `walletpassphrase`: the wallet passphrase you entered\n* `address`: the Verus address corresponding to your passphrase\n* `pubkey`: the hex value of the raw public key\n* `privkey`: the hex value of the raw private key\n* `wif`: the private key in WIF format, which can be used with the `importprivkey` command\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! I've also come across the `decryptdata` command, but I'm not sure what it does. Can you explain it to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `decryptdata` command is used to decrypt a vdxf data descriptor, which is typically encrypted to a z-address. If the viewing key or the spending key (ssk) is correct, the object will be returned with as much decryption as possible. If no decryption is possible, this function returns an error.",
