    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to verify a signature and I got the result \"true\". What does that mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen verifying a signature, a result of \"true\" indicates that the signature is valid. It means that the signature matches the expected signature for the given data, and the verification process was successful.\n\n**User:**\nI've been using an older version of Verus, but I heard I should update to a newer version. Why is it important to update to Verus version 0.9.5 or later for mainnet use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! It is crucial to update to Verus version 0.9.5 or later for mainnet use to reliably stay synchronized with the Verus mainnet. Failing to do so may cause issues with synchronization, which can lead to problems with your transactions and overall user experience.\n\n**User:**\nWhat changes does Verus version 0.9.5-2 introduce for mainnet and testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFor mainnet, version 0.9.5-2 labels spendable transactions for the getaddressutxos RPC API, which is used by Verus Mobile. For testnet, it introduces minor notarization fixes important for launching and witnessing PBaaS chains.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of the Ethereum bridge, but I'm not sure what it is or how to use it. Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Ethereum bridge is a feature that allows for cross-chain transactions between the Verus network and Ethereum's Goerli testnet. You can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge at https://ethtest.verus.services/, and use your MetaMask to convert or send cross-chain to the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli testnet. This allows for seamless interactions between the two networks, expanding the possibilities for decentralized applications and use cases.",
