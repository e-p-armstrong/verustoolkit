    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a new currency in Verus and I'm not sure about the `proofprotocol` setting. What does it mean to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency in Verus, it means that you are setting the proof protocol to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Does that make sense? Do you have any questions about what that means or how it works?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that helps. So, how can I mint new coins of a currency that has PROOF_CHAINID as its proof protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins of a currency that has PROOF_CHAINID as its proof protocol, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option set to 1. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command will mint 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and send them to the address \"mike@\". Make sure to replace \"mycoin@\" and \"mike@\" with your actual currency and address, respectively. Do you have any other questions about minting new coins or using the `sendcurrency` command?",
