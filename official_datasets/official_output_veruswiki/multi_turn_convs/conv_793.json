    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm about to start using the Verus software, and I was wondering, what kind of warranty or guarantee does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that there are no warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Just something to keep in mind as you start using the software!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What happens if I encounter issues or damages while using the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. Just a heads up, so you're aware of the terms.\n\n**User:**\nI've been using Verus for a bit, and my antivirus software keeps flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus is a mining software, and some antivirus software may flag it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program) because it can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, these warnings are false positives, and Verus is safe to use. You can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives. Don't worry, Verus is okay!",
