    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still a bit unclear on the specifics of VerusIDs. Can you explain the purpose of a revocation and recovery authority in a locked VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe revocation and recovery authority in a locked VerusID allows the specified identities to revoke and recover the locked ID, even if it has been unlocked by someone with the primary keys. This provides an additional layer of security and decentralized funds recovery. It's an important feature that gives you more control over your digital assets.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've heard of the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" before, but how does Verus Vault protect against it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault protects against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" by allowing users to set a time lock on their IDs, which requires a predetermined unlock time before funds can be accessed. This time lock can be set to a period of time, such as 24 hours, giving the revocation and recovery authority time to detect and respond to any unauthorized unlock attempts. This adds an extra layer of security to prevent theft or loss of assets.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what other use cases are supported by Verus Vault beyond just fund protection?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault also supports use cases such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance, in addition to protecting IDs and NFTs. It provides a decentralized solution for securing and recovering assets on the blockchain. The possibilities are vast, and Verus Vault is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different use cases. Does that help clarify things?",

            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.
