    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into Verus and its multisig capabilities. Can you tell me about a significant improvement to multisig capabilities in Verus and how it differs from other networks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne of the significant improvements to multisig capabilities in Verus is the ability to issue \"sendcurrency\" commands with a multisig ID as the source, even if not all the keys are present in the wallet. This allows for more flexibility and ease of use when working with multisig IDs.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if I try to issue a \"sendcurrency\" command with a multisig ID as the source, but I have all the keys present in my wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you try to issue a \"sendcurrency\" command with a multisig ID as the source, but you have all the keys present in your wallet, you will receive a return error in the operation status. This error will include the partially signed transaction, which can then be used by applications or copied and pasted to send to other signers with partial authority over the source ID.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I was also wondering about the types of destinations supported for transactions from multisig IDs on mainnet and testnet.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn mainnet, destinations for transactions from multisig IDs can include IDs, private addresses with memos to a z-address or ID:private, and transparent addresses. On testnet, destinations can include all of the above, as well as multiple currencies, currency conversions, and cross-chain sends.\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand. But how do I actually sign a transaction from a multisig ID, and what are the steps to broadcast it on the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign a transaction from a multisig ID, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the transaction using `verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'`.\n2. Get the raw transaction data using `verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs, and sign it using `verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>`.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>`.\n\nThis process allows you to sign a transaction from a multisig ID, even if you don't have all the keys present in your wallet.",
