    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a few more questions about VerusIDs. How do I create a time-locked identity using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a time-locked identity using Verus, you can use the `teidentity` command with the following format:\n\n```\nteidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n\nThis command creates a new identity with a time lock, which can be unlocked after a specified block delay. Do you have any questions about this command or the format?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. But what happens when I revoke an identity that is currently locked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you revoke an identity that is currently locked, the locked status will be cleared, regardless of the time delay or unlock height. However, note that a locked identity cannot revoke itself. So, you'll need to use an authorized identity to revoke the locked one.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification! One more question, how do I retrieve a list of currencies that have a certain level of liquidity using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to retrieve a list of currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example, to retrieve a list of currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold, you can use the following command:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\n\nThis will return a list of currencies that meet the specified liquidity criteria.",
