    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have some questions about the Verus software. What kind of warranty or liability does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I did notice that my antivirus software flagged the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAntivirus software might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a warning to inform you that you are installing mining software. However, these warnings are false positives, and the software is safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nWhere can I find more information about these false positive warnings from antivirus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about the false positive warnings from antivirus software by reviewing the following resources: https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/ and https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/. These resources should provide you with more information about why antivirus software might flag the Verus software.\n\n**User:**\nAre there any resources available to check the safety of the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can check the safety of the Verus software by visiting the VirusTotal website, which provides detection results from various antivirus engines. The links to VirusTotal for different platforms are: MacOS - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a70cd7e14f4b43a0c0123fb938881ccc7900396ce14057e4887986c591a2d506/detection, Linux-x86-64 - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/26af0cebea1b579b1e7d55c3fcd927a2da1d58c4b3d4461e7039858f3f12f0f5/detection, Linux-ARM64 - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ef820935c721c11b0843e7925be5ba56b77937030028ca4ccab038c3117571a1/detection, and Windows - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9c9d63e43e93b6c2b86a1ef2c70d62c92c9b280fa86a1c7c091b4053f48300a5/detection.
