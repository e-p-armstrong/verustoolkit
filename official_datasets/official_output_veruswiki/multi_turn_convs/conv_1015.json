    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and I'm really interested in its technology. Can you tell me more about the significance of the Verus invention of consensus-capable oracle notifications in the core protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus invention of consensus-capable oracle notifications in the core protocol is a game-changer. It enables dynamic coordinated consensus changes that can be triggered at a time decided after the actual release, without compromising decentralization. This allows for seamless decentralized network upgrades. It's a major innovation that sets Verus apart from other blockchain protocols.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds fascinating. Can you elaborate on how oracle notifications facilitate network upgrades?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOracle notifications enable dynamic coordinated consensus changes, which can be triggered at a time decided after the actual release. This means that the network can be upgraded without requiring a bootstrap for the upgrade. If a node is not capable of upgrading, the oracle upgrade technology will enable the daemon to recognize this and request that the user upgrade to a newer version. It's a much more efficient and decentralized way to handle network upgrades.\n\n**User:**\nI understand. So, before upgrading the mainnet, you test the upgrade on testnet first. What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTesting the upgrade on testnet before upgrading mainnet allows for a trial run to ensure the upgrade is successful and stable before applying it to the mainnet. This helps to mitigate potential issues and ensures a smoother transition to the new protocol. It's a crucial step in the upgrade process that helps to ensure the integrity of the network.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if additional changes are made to the protocol after a software release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf additional changes are made to the protocol after a software release, the oracle upgrade technology will enable the daemon to recognize that the current version is not capable and request that the user upgrade to a newer version. This ensures that nodes can seamlessly upgrade to the latest version of the protocol. It's a flexible and dynamic system that allows for continuous improvement and evolution of the protocol.",

This allows for seamless decentralized network upgrades.",
            "2. **Enabling Seamless Decentralized Network Upgrades**: This release includes a Verus invention of consensus-capable oracle notifications built into the core protocol, which enable dynamic coordinated consensus changes that can be triggered at a time decided after the actual release which enables them, all without any compromise on decentralization. The Verus Community may decide that we are ready to go earlier than one week on this upgrade and activate it, even before its scheduled time. The good news is that this first test upgrade will primarily affect testnet and prepare for the mainnet PBaaS upgrade, so it is a perfect test case for a mainnet test run before we #LaunchPBaaS. This release actually has the ability to upgrade mainnet to PBaaS, but we believe it is prudent to have at least some time on this new protocol on testnet before the v1.0 release, which will upgrade mainnet. If we make no additional changes to the protocol in this release, which we do not intend to do at this time, this version may be able to follow the v1.0 upgrade. If we determine that it cannot, the oracle upgrade technology will enable the daemon to recognize that it is not capable and request that the user upgrade to a newer version without requiring a bootstrap for the upgrade. **(Mainnet + Testnet)**",
