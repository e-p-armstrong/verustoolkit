    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been out of the loop for a bit and I'm trying to catch up on the latest changes to Verus. Can you tell me what changes were made to Coinbase shielding in the latest software update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, of course! Coinbase shielding is no longer required on coinbases from the past that have not yet been shielded. This should simplify things a bit. Do you have any other questions about the update?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How does staking work with Verus IDs after the update that changed staking rules?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter the recent update, staking will now work on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds. This should give you more flexibility with your Verus IDs. Do you have any other questions about staking or IDs?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that helps clarify things. What's this I hear about a new `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new `sendcurrency` API is a command line tool that provides more control when sending from and to multiple addresses or identities. It's a useful addition to the Verus toolset. Do you have any questions about how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nNot yet, I'll have to look into it more. What changes were made to the `updateidentity` command in the latest update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `updateidentity` command can now change the case of characters in the name of a VerusID in the global locale. This should make it easier to manage your Verus IDs. Do you have any other questions about identity management?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How does revocation work after the update to the identity management system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter revocation, the revocation identity will lose all control over an ID, including the ability to change the revocation identity itself. The recovery identity will now have full control over the revoked ID. This change should make revocation more straightforward. Do you have any other questions about revocation or recovery?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that helps. Finally, what are the implications of using Verus, in terms of risk and warranty?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question. Verus is experimental and unfinished software, and users should be aware that they use it at their own risk, with no warranty for any kind of damage. It's important to keep this in mind when using Verus.",
