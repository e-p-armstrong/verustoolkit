    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm planning to update my Verus wallet, but I'm a bit worried about losing important data. What should I do before updating to ensure I don't lose anything?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBefore updating your Verus wallet, make sure your wallet is not active, and backup essential files such as `wallet.dat` and `VRSC.conf` to a safe location. This will ensure that you don't lose your wallet data during the update process. Have you done this before, or would you like more information about the process?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds easy enough. But how can I be sure that the Verus wallet download is genuine and hasn't been tampered with? I've heard of fake downloads being spread online.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great concern! You can verify the authenticity of the Verus wallet download by checking the SHA256 checksum and signature of the download. This ensures that the installer you downloaded is genuine and has not been tampered with. We always recommend verifying the integrity of the download to prevent any potential issues.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! So, what files should I keep when updating my Verus wallet? I don't want to lose any important data.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen updating your Verus wallet, you should keep essential files such as `wallet.dat`, `debug.log`, `VRSC.conf`, and `VRSC-bootstrap.*` (if applicable). Remove all other files and folders from the `VRSC Wallet location` to ensure a clean update. This will ensure that your wallet data is preserved, and the update process goes smoothly.\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing - how do I install the bootstrap for my Verus wallet? I've heard it's important for the wallet to sync correctly.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo install the bootstrap for your Verus wallet, download the bootstrap from the provided link, verify the checksum and signature (optional but recommended), remove all files and folders from the `VRSC Wallet location` except for essential files, and then extract the downloaded archive to the `VRSC Wallet location`. Make sure the folders `blocks` and `chainstate` are extracted to the correct location. This will ensure that your wallet syncs correctly and you have the correct blockchain data.",
