What kind of disclaimer or warning comes with using Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! Verus software is considered experimental and unfinished, and comes with a warning to \"use at your own risk\" with no warranty for any kind of damage. Additionally, the software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-INFRINGEMENT. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. Just something to keep in mind when using Verus software!",
