    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with the Verus API and I was wondering, what does the `currencyconverters` API do in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `currencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that meet certain conditions. Specifically, it returns currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, a VRSC reserve ratio greater than 10%, and all listed currencies as reserves. Do you have any experience with the Verus API or is this your first time exploring it?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I was wondering if I could use the `getcurrencyconverters` command to retrieve currencies that have a specific market, such as BTC/ETH. Is that possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` command with the specific currencies you're interested in as arguments. For example, to retrieve all currencies that have a BTC/ETH market at or above the liquidity threshold, you can run the following command:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\n\nThis will return a list of currencies that meet the specified conditions and have a BTC/ETH market. The `-chain=VRSCTEST` flag is optional, but it's useful for testing purposes. Have you tried running this command before, or would you like more information on how to use it?",
