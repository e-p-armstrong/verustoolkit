    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to download the Verus software, but I'm getting some warnings from my antivirus software, Avast. It's saying that the Verus software is a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAvast and Kaspersky might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it is mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and the Verus software is safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But what should I do if I encounter a false positive warning from Avast or Kaspersky?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you encounter a false positive warning from Avast or Kaspersky, you can review our documentation and FAQs to understand more about the warning. These resources explain that the warning is likely due to the software being mining software, and not an actual virus or malware. You can safely ignore the warning and continue to use the Verus software.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What kind of warranty or guarantee does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software comes with no warranty or guarantee. It is provided \"AS IS\", without any express or implied warranties, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
