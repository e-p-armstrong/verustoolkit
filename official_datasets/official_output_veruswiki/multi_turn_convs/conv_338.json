    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to download the Verus software, but my antivirus software keeps flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question! Your antivirus software might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it detects the presence of mining software, which could potentially be used to exploit your PC if installed by a third party. This is a false positive warning. You don't need to worry; the Verus software is safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. But how can I verify the authenticity of a Verus software download? I want to make sure I'm getting the real deal.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus software download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can also use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the file or hash directly. Would you like me to explain how to do that?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please! I'd like to know more about the txt file provided with each Verus software download. What information is included in that file?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe txt file provided with each Verus software download includes the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. This information can be used to verify the authenticity of the download.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. So, how can I use the Verus CLI to verify a file or hash? You mentioned the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands earlier.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify a file or hash. The syntax for these commands is as follows:\n\n`./verus verifyfile \"signer_identity\" \"signature\" \"file_path\"`\n\n`./verus verifyhash \"signer_identity\" \"signature\" \"hash_value\"`\n\nReplace \"signer_identity\" with the identity of the signer (e.g. \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\"), \"signature\" with the signature provided in the txt file, and \"file_path\" or \"hash_value\" with the path to the file or the hash value you want to verify.",
