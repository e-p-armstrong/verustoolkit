    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new currency in Verus, and I'm not sure about the `proofprotocol` setting. What does it mean to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID, which allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. This setting gives the controller control over the supply of the currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. What is the purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to PROOF_CHAINID when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSetting `proofprotocol` to PROOF_CHAINID allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins, giving them control over the supply of the currency. This can be useful in scenarios where a central authority needs to manage the money supply or issue new coins for a specific purpose.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I understand. How can I mint new coins for a currency with `proofprotocol` set to PROOF_CHAINID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins for a currency with `proofprotocol` set to PROOF_CHAINID, you can use the `sendcurrency` command, specifying the currency, the address to receive the new coins, and the amount to mint. For example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n\nThis command would mint 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and send them to the address \"mike@\". Make sure to replace \"mycoin\" and \"mike@\" with your actual currency and address.",
