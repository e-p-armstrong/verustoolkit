    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to install Verus, but my antivirus software is flagging it as a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a common issue. If your antivirus software flags the Verus software as a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", it's likely a false positive warning. This warning is triggered because the software includes mining capabilities, which could potentially be exploited by third parties to use your PC for mining without your consent. You can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives. It's safe to ignore the warning and proceed with the installation.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But how can I verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify a Verus download, follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands to verify the signature and checksum of the download. The signer's identity is \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". The result will be `true` if the signature is valid. This ensures that you're installing the official and genuine Verus software.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in Verus, anyway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download. They check the digital signature and checksum of the download to ensure that it has not been tampered with or corrupted during transmission. This helps to ensure that you are installing the official and genuine Verus software. It's an extra layer of security to give you peace of mind when installing Verus.",
