    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about creating a new currency with Verus. What does it mean to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! How can I mint new coins as the controller of a chain ID with Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins as the controller of a chain ID, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command will mint 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and send them to the address \"mike@\". Do you have any more questions about minting coins?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! I've got another question. What is the `initialsupply` option used for when defining a new currency with Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `initialsupply` option sets the initial supply of the new currency. In the example, `initialsupply` is set to 20,000, which means that the initial supply of \"mycoin\" is 20,000 units. This determines how many units of the currency exist at the time of creation. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about creating a new currency?",
