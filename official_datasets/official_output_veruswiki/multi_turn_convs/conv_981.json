    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm interested in learning more about Verus and its applications. What are some key benefits of using Verus for token launches and crowdfunding?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers several benefits for token launches and crowdfunding. For instance, you can specify a percentage of proceeds, offer pre-launch discounts for early participants, and even set up vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs. These features provide a lot of flexibility and control over your token launch or crowdfunding campaign.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really useful. What's the main advantage of the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main advantage of the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is that it allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, enabling unlimited scale and new use cases. This is made possible by decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation through Notary IDs. This architecture enables a high degree of flexibility and scalability, which is really powerful.\n\n**User:**\nThat's fascinating. How does the Verus network enable private, internal blockchains to operate alongside public blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network enables private, internal blockchains to operate alongside public blockchains by making it easy to set up bridging of public currencies into an organization's internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. This allows organizations to maintain control and privacy while still leveraging the benefits of public blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about VerusIDs. What are the two main types of locks that can be applied to an ID in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe two main types of locks that can be applied to an ID in Verus are Time Lock and Time Delay. Time Lock defines the unlock height of the identity, while Time Delay defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What happens to a locked identity if it is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a locked identity is revoked, its locked status will be cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height. So, revocation will take precedence over any lock settings.\n\n**User:**\nAnd one more question about locked IDs: Can a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. That's an important security feature to prevent unintended revocations.",

Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access.
