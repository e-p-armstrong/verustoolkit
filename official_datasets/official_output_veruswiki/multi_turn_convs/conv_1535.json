    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a currency from an ID using the GUI or CLI. Are there any limitations I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is an important limitation to keep in mind. When creating a currency from an ID, you should avoid using an i-address as the actual name of the ID. This is because an i-address will be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. Using an i-address as the name of an ID can cause problems in many cases and will not be supported for creating currencies.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks for the warning. But why is it a problem to use an i-address as the name of an ID? Is there a specific reason for this limitation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou should avoid using an i-address as the name of an ID because it can cause confusion and problems when referring to the ID or currency. The naming system will expand the set of characters that are not allowed for currency registrations to reduce user confusion. It's just a precaution to ensure that everything works smoothly and as intended.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification. I'm also interested in creating a PBaaS chain with a currency name that is already supported in Verus Desktop, like BTC or ETH. Is that possible using the GUI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, that's not possible in the GUI right now. If a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, you won't be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This is a limitation that will be resolved before mainnet availability, so keep an eye out for future updates.\n\n**User:**\nI see. One last question: what's the disclaimer for using this software, and what are the terms of the permission granted?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer states that this is experimental and unfinished software, and users should use it at their own risk.
