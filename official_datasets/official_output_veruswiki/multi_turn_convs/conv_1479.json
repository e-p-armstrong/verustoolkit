    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there, I'm having some trouble with signing transactions from a multi-signature ID on the Verus testnet. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! To sign transactions from a multi-signature ID on the Verus testnet or mainnet, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using the `sendcurrency` command.\n2. Take the raw hex transaction data and provide it to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n3. Use the `signrawtransaction` command to sign the raw hex transaction data on each wallet.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command.\n\nIf you have any questions about these steps or need further clarification, feel free to ask! Do you have any other questions about Verus or multi-signature IDs?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! I was also wondering, what features does the new Verus testnet offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers:\n\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions\n* Ability to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way\n\nThese features make it a powerful and flexible platform for users. Do you have any other questions about the Verus testnet or its features?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds impressive. What is the significance of the new Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet marks the beginning of a new age in crypto, offering a wide range of features and capabilities that are not available on other cryptocurrency platforms. It provides a decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that enables users to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains, and to send and convert currencies with ease.\n\nThis has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. It's an exciting time for Verus and for the crypto community as a whole! Do you have any other questions about Verus or its potential impact?",
