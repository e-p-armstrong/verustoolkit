    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been getting some warnings from my antivirus software about Verus. Why do Avast and Kaspersky flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Avast and Kaspersky flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it includes mining software, which could potentially be used by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can learn more about it by reviewing the resources provided. Don't worry, Verus is a legitimate and safe software.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about some changes made to the Verus mainnet protocol. What changes were made to the Verus mainnet protocol at block 800200?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAt block 800200, the Verus mainnet protocol was updated to include VerusID. This update also fixed the accretion of coinbases in the mempool. It was a significant milestone in the development of Verus.\n\n**User:**\nSpeaking of VerusID, can you tell me more about it? What is VerusID, and how does it differ from other blockchain ID implementations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusID is a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. VerusIDs provide opportunities for identity applications and offer features such as quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability, and privacy. In short, VerusID is a decentralized, private, and powerful identity solution that gives users full control over their digital identity.",
