    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with Verus IDs and I'm curious about locking them. How can I lock an ID in Verus, and what is the purpose of the timelock parameter?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can lock an ID in Verus by setting the flags to a locked state and specifying a timelock parameter, which defines the unlock height of the identity. The timelock parameter can be used to set a specific block height at which the ID will be unlocked. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! But I have a follow-up question. What is the difference between the timelock parameter in the updateidentity command when the flags are set to 0 versus when the flags are set to 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the flags are set to 0, the timelock parameter specifies the unlock height of the identity. When the flags are set to 2, the timelock parameter specifies the number of blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. So, it really depends on how you're using the flags and the timelock. Do you have any other questions about locking IDs or using the timelock?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I do. What happens to a locked identity when it is revoked in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a locked identity is revoked in Verus, its locked status is cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height that was set. So, revoking a locked ID essentially resets its status.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. Can a locked identity revoke itself in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself in Verus. You'll need to use a different ID with the necessary permissions to revoke a locked ID.\n\n**User:**\nMoving on from IDs, I've been looking at the Verus API and saw the `getcurrencyconverters` API. What is the purpose of this API, and how do I use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. You can use it by specifying the currencies you are interested in, for example: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth`. This will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold. It's a useful tool for finding currencies with sufficient liquidity for trading.",
