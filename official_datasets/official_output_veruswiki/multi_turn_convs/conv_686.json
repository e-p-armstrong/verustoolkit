    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how currencies work on the Verus network. Can you help me with that? Specifically, how does a currency's value change when people convert to or from it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help. When people convert to a fractionally backed currency, its value appreciates. Conversely, when people convert from it, its value depreciates. This is because the reserve ratio of the currency changes based on the inflow or outflow of funds.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been looking into the fundraising process on Verus. What happens to fundraising if a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met, no fundraising is received. The funds are simply returned to the participants, and the launch does not proceed.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen some launches offer pre-launch discounts. Can you tell me more about those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA pre-launch discount is a discount given to participants who contribute to a launch before it goes live on its start block. This discount is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency remains in demand when it goes live. It's a way to incentivize early adopters and build momentum for the launch.\n\n**User:**\nI've also seen mentions of pre-launch carve-outs. How do those work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA pre-launch carve-out enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price-neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch. This can be a way for the launch team to reward themselves or other stakeholders for their efforts in bringing the currency to market.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question: what is pre-allocation, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPre-allocation enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price-neutral manner, and is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time-locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods. This allows the launch team to allocate funds to key stakeholders or partners, or to set aside funds for future development or marketing efforts.",
