    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got some questions about how Verus works. What happens to fees generated on a new blockchain created using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFees generated on a new blockchain created using Verus, whether through cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool, are earned on the new blockchain itself. None of these fees are sent back to the Verus blockchain, ensuring seamless connectivity between the blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been wondering about crowdfunding currency launches on Verus. How do those work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, crowdfunding currency launches can be set up with minimum participation requirements in one or more currencies. If the minimum participation levels are not met by the launch time, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees. The launch options also allow for maximum participation, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations, and vesting schedules.\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to know more about the Verus network itself. What is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what are its capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a decentralized network that enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. It allows for the setup of public blockchains, available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can be easily bridged with public currencies. The network has no limit on the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate simultaneously, with features like decentralized bridge confirmation and easy bridging of public currencies into private networks.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really powerful. I've heard of Notary IDs in the context of Verus. What role do they play in the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling the creation of public and private blockchains with seamless interoperation.",
