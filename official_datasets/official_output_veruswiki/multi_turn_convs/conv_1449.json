    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been experimenting with VerusIDs and I have a question about locking an ID. How do I lock an ID using the `timelock` parameter in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo lock an ID using the `timelock` parameter, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `flags` set to 0 and specify the `timelock` height at which the ID should be unlocked. Here's an example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nDoes that help? Do you have any other questions about locking IDs in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! I'm also curious about the `timelock` parameter when setting `flags` to 2. What's its purpose in that case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen setting `flags` to 2, the `timelock` parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. So, it's essentially a delay before the ID can be unlocked again.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a locked identity if it is revoked in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a locked identity is revoked, its locked status will be cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height. So, revoking a locked ID essentially cancels the lock and revokes the ID.\n\n**User:**\nCan a locked identity revoke itself in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself in Verus. It would need to be revoked by another authorized ID or authority.\n\n**User:**\nMoving on to a different topic, I'm interested in using the `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus to retrieve currencies that meet certain liquidity requirements. How do I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API by specifying the currencies you're interested in, and it will return all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold. Does that help?",
