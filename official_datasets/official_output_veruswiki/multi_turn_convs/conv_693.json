    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the different currency options in Verus. Can you explain the purpose of the `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` currency option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` currency option in Verus allows for reserve conversion using base calculations when set. This means that if a currency has this option enabled, it can be converted using fractional reserve calculations. Do you have any other questions about this option or would you like to know about other currency options?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, I do. What does the `OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE` currency option do in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE` currency option in Verus restricts ID creation to only be possible by the controlling ID if set. This means that if a currency has this option enabled, only the controlling ID can create new IDs. Do you have any questions about how this option is used or would you like to know about other currency options?\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to know more about other options. What does the `OPTION_TOKEN` currency option do in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_TOKEN` currency option in Verus indicates that the currency is a token, rather than a native currency. This distinction is important for how the currency is treated in the Verus ecosystem. Would you like to know about more options?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please. What is the purpose of the `OPTION_GATEWAY` currency option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_GATEWAY` currency option in Verus indicates that the currency routes external currencies. This means that the currency is used as a gateway to facilitate transactions between different currencies. Do you have any questions about how this option works or would you like to know about other currency options?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I think I understand. What does the `OPTION_PBAAS` currency option do in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_PBAAS` currency option in Verus indicates that the currency is a PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) chain definition. This means that the currency is part of a private blockchain service that allows for customizable blockchain solutions. Do you have any questions about PBaaS or would you like to know about other currency options?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I think I'm good. What is the purpose of the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` currency option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` currency option in Verus creates a single satoshi NFT (Non-Fungible Token) token that tokenizes control over the root ID. This means that the NFT token represents a unique digital asset that can be owned and transferred. Do you have any questions about NFT tokens or would you like to know more about Verus in general?",
