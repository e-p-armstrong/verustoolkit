    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to learn more about Verus and I have some questions. What does the `-genproclimit` option do when running Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-genproclimit` option sets the number of threads for coin mining if enabled. You can set it to a specific number of threads or use `-1` to utilize all available cores. The default value is 0.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. What about the `-mineraddress` option? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-mineraddress` option allows you to specify a single address where mined coins will be sent.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What's the effect of setting `-minetolocalwallet` to 1 in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `-minetolocalwallet` is set to 1 (which is the default), mined blocks must use a coinbase address from the local wallet.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I specify a custom mining distribution in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `-miningdistribution` option to specify a custom mining distribution. This option accepts a JSON object with destination addresses or IDs and relative amounts used as ratios to divide total rewards and fees.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does the `-mint` option do in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-mint` option enables automatic minting and staking of coins.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `-pubkey` option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-pubkey` option specifies a default address where mining and staking rewards will be sent.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen some options referred to as PBaaS options. What are they, and what do they control?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPBaaS options in Verus are a set of options that control the behavior of Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) chains. These options include settings for accepting free imports, notarization behavior, contract upgrades, block time, chain selection, mining distribution, and notary IDs.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. What does the `-acceptfreeimportsfrom` option do in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-acceptfreeimportsfrom` option allows you to specify a list of PBaaS chains or networks from which to accept underpaid imports.\n\n**User:**\nWhat does the `-alwayssubmitnotarizations` option do in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-alwayssubmitnotarizations` option forces the submission of notarizations to the notary chain whenever merge mining or staking is eligible.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `-approvecontractupgrade` option in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `-approvecontractupgrade` option allows you to vote in favor of upgrading to a specific contract when validating blocks.",
