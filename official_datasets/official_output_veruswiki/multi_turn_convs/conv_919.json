    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in the technical and legal aspects of Verus. Can you tell me what kind of software license does Verus use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus uses a permissive free software license, which allows anyone to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software. The license includes a permission notice and a copyright notice that must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. Would you like to know more about the implications of this license?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What kind of warranty is provided with Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that there is no guarantee that the software will work as expected, and users use it at their own risk. It's essential to understand this before using the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen a Verus software release for testing and development with public blockchains as a service (PBaaS). What's the purpose of this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis release of Verus software is intended for testing and development with public blockchains as a service (PBaaS). It is not an official release and should not be used as a main wallet. It's meant for developers and testers to experiment and provide feedback before the official release.\n\n**User:**\nIs this release of Verus software compatible with the Verus mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, this release of Verus software does work with the Verus mainnet, but it does not support PBaaS on mainnet. So, while it can be used on the mainnet, it's primary purpose is for testing and development with PBaaS.",
