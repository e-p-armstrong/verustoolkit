    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still learning about VerusIDs, can you tell me what it means for them to be \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\" on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs being \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\" means that they are resistant to quantum attacks using known algorithms. This means that even when quantum computers become available, VerusIDs will still be secure. Additionally, a quantum secure signature scheme is being integrated, which will allow for retroactive quantum resistance for funds sent to an ID. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that does. Another question I have is, how do VerusIDs control the funds sent to them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs control the funds sent to them through single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. This ensures that the owner of the VerusID has full control over their funds.\n\n**User:**\nYou mentioned earlier that VerusIDs are fully decentralized. What makes them a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are a fully decentralized protocol because anyone can create one without needing permission, and they have complete, self-sovereign control over it. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. This means that there is no central authority controlling the creation or management of VerusIDs. It's a community-driven system that allows individuals to have full control over their digital identity.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What does it mean for a VerusID to be revocable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID being revocable means that each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. This revocation authority has the permission to revoke the identity, creating a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds. This can be useful in cases such as key theft. It's an added layer of security that allows individuals to protect their assets in case of an emergency.",

            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so.
