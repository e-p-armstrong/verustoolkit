    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to connect to a defined chain using the command line. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can connect to a defined chain using the command line by running the following command:\n\n```\n./komodod -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\n\nReplace `SOMECOIN` with the name of the chain you want to connect to. Did you try that already, or do you have any questions about the process?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I'm trying to connect to a chain for the first time, what happens when I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you connect to a chain for the first time, a local config file is created. This means that you won't need to run VRSCTEST to connect to the chain again in the future. However, you will still need to run VRSCTEST to merge mine. Is there anything else you'd like to know about connecting to a chain?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Where are the config files for each chain stored, exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe config files for each chain are stored in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME` directory, which serves as the home directory for a PBaaS chain. The presence of a correct config file enables the chain to load as an independent chain. Do you have any other questions about config files or chain setup?\n\n**User:**\nBefore I start using the Verus Desktop software, I want to make sure I understand the disclaimer. Can you tell me what it says?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer states that this is experimental and unfinished software, and it should be used at your own risk.
