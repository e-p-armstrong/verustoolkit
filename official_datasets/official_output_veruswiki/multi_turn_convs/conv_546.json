    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'd like to understand more about how Verus works. What is the relationship between an ID and a currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, an ID is required to create a currency of a specific name. The controller of the ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. This means that the ID and currency share the same name, and the ID's controller has exclusive control over the creation of the currency.\n\nThink of it like a unique namespace, where the ID owner has the power to create a currency with a specific name, and no one else can create a currency with the same name. This provides a level of exclusivity and control over the creation of currencies in Verus. Does that make sense?",

I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a busines",
