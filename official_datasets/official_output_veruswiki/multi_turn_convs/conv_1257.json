    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm interested in launching a new currency on the Verus network. What are the requirements for doing so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a new currency on the Verus network, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST, and have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specific rate (in this case, 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch. Additionally, the launch process begins 50 blocks after the transaction is initiated, and the conversion fees earned during the launch process are distributed to miners as part of the mining process. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about launching a new currency on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. I was wondering how I can convert VRSCTEST to a new token (like GOLD) before it launches, and what happens when the token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to a new token (like GOLD) before it launches by issuing a command to sendcurrency, like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches. When the token launches, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned. This way, you can prepare for the launch of the new token and have your VRSCTEST converted as soon as it becomes available.",
