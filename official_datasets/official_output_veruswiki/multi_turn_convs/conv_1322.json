    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm considering using Verus but I have some concerns about the safety and liability of the software. Can you tell me what kind of warranty or liability comes with Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to clarify that for you. The Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I did notice that some antivirus software flags Verus as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Is Verus malware?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus is not malware. Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag Verus as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software. This is a warning that you are installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, this is a false positive, and Verus is a legitimate software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I verify the safety of the Verus software to make sure it's not malicious?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify the safety of the Verus software by checking the virus scan results on VirusTotal, a reputable online virus scanning service. The links to the scan results for different platforms (MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows) are provided. Additionally, you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about false positives and PUP warnings. This should give you confidence that Verus is a safe and legitimate software.",
