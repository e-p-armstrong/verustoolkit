    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to create a new currency with Verus and I'm not entirely sure what some of the settings do. Can you help me out? Specifically, what does it mean to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency with Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new currency, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about creating a new currency with Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! So if I set `proofprotocol` to 2, how can I mint new coins of a currency I've created with Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins of a currency you've created with Verus, where the `proofprotocol` is set to 2, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. The command would look something like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command would mint 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and send them to the address \"mike@\". Just replace \"mycoin\" with your currency's name and \"mike@\" with the address you want to send the coins to. Does that help?",
