    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi! I've been playing around with Verus and I have a few questions. When I'm verifying a signature, what does the output \"true\" indicate?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe output \"true\" indicates that the signature is valid.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks! I've also been looking at the APIs, and I was wondering, what is the purpose of the `getcurrencybalance` API in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencybalance` API allows you to retrieve multi-currency balances on transparent, private addresses, and identities.\n\n**User:**\nI've also noticed some changes to the `z_getbalance` API. Can you tell me what's changed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getbalance` API has been updated to support the \"z*\" wildcard.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also interested in DeFi features on the Verus testnet. Can I use private z-addresses to source funds for DeFi features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, on the Verus testnet, you can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I just updated my Verus Desktop software. Do I need to reset the testnet after the upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, there is no testnet reset required after this upgrade. You're good to go!",
