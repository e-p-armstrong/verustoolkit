    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves a list of all currencies that meet certain conditions. Specifically, it returns currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, have a reserve ratio greater than 10% VRSC, and have all listed currencies as reserves. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, but I'm still a bit unclear. How can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies with specific markets?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies with specific markets by specifying the desired markets as arguments. For example, to find all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets with sufficient liquidity, you can run the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return a list of all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold. Just replace `btc` and `eth` with the markets you're interested in, and you'll get a list of currencies that meet those conditions.",
