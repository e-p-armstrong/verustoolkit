    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the Verus CLI, but I'm not sure how to enter the commands correctly on my operating system. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen entering Verus CLI commands, it's essential to format them correctly depending on your operating system. Here are some guidelines to follow:\n\n* On Linux and MacOS, enter the commands as shown in the CLI help, using single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`\"`) as indicated.\n* On Windows, using the native command prompt (`cmd.com`), substitute single quotes (`'`) with double quotes (`\"`), and double quotes (`\"`) with escaped double quotes (`\\\"`). Also, omit the preceding `./` from the command.\n\nFor example, the Linux command `./verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> '[{\"address\":\"<my_transparent_address>\",\"amount\":<95.9998>}]'` would become `verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> \"[{\\\"address\\\":\\\"<my_transparent_address>\\\",\\\"amount\\\":<95.9998>}]\"` on Windows.\n\nDo you have any questions about this or would you like more information?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about `<userinput>` in the commands? What should I replace that with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using Verus CLI commands, replace `<userinput>` with your specific user data, such as a public address or other relevant information. Make sure to remove the `<` and `>` characters, and enter the actual data in their place. For example, if you're prompted to enter `<my_private_address_without_quotationmarks>`, you would replace that with your actual private address without the quotes.\n\nDoes that clarify things for you?",
