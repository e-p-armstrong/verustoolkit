    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been using Verus for a while now, but I've run into some issues with my antivirus software. Why do some antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Some antivirus software may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it contains mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning. Don't worry, Verus is a legitimate software, and you can safely ignore this warning.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But how can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download to make sure I'm getting the real deal?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can follow these steps: extract the downloaded archive, verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, and extract the archive to the desired directory. You can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the signature. The package has been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\".\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI? Are they just for verifying downloads?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI are used to verify the authenticity of a Verus download by checking the signature of the file or hash. If the signature is valid, the command will return `true`. These commands are specifically designed to ensure that the download is genuine and hasn't been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nI've been meaning to ask, what happens if I don't upgrade my full node to the recommended version of Verus? Will it still work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't upgrade your full node to the recommended version of Verus, you may not be able to connect to the mainnet Verus blockchain. You may need to bootstrap or resync your native wallet or node after upgrading. It is recommended to upgrade full nodes to the latest version to ensure reliable connection to the mainnet. Upgrading to the latest version will ensure that you can continue to use Verus without any issues.",
