    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with the `getoffers` command in Verus, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. Can you explain its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getoffers` command is used to retrieve a list of all available offers for or in a specified currency or ID. It can be used to check for both sale and purchase offers. Do you have any questions about how to use it or what kind of offers it returns?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How do I specify whether I want to search for ID offers or currency offers when using the `getoffers` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can specify whether to search for ID offers or currency offers by using the `iscurrency` argument. If `iscurrency` is set to `false` (default), the command will look for ID offers. If `iscurrency` is set to `true`, the command will look for currency offers. Simple enough, right?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the `withtx` argument? What's that for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `withtx` argument is an optional boolean argument that, if set to `true`, returns the serialized hex of the exchange transaction for signing. It's a handy feature if you need to work with the transaction directly.\n\n**User:**\nMoving on to a related topic, what's the purpose of the `listopenoffers` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listopenoffers` command is used to show all outstanding offers in the wallet. It's a great way to keep track of your active offers and manage them accordingly.\n\n**User:**\nIs there a way to filter the results of the `listopenoffers` command to show only unexpired or expired offers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can filter the results of the `listopenoffers` command by using the `unexpired` and `expired` arguments. If `unexpired` is set to `true` (default), the command will list those offers in the wallet which are not expired. If `expired` is set to `true` (default), the command will list those offers in the wallet which are expired. This can be really useful for managing your offers and keeping track of which ones are still active.",
