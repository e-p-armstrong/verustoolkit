    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about DeFi protocols and I'm curious about how Verus addresses some of the common problems. Can you tell me how the Verus DeFi protocol addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running in currency conversions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been reading about the unique approach Verus takes to launching new blockchains. Can you tell me more about the significance of the simultaneous launch of a blockchain and a liquidity pool in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe simultaneous launch of a blockchain and a liquidity pool in Verus allows for a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool to be launched alongside a new blockchain. This bridge converter liquidity pool is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. How does Verus ensure that a new blockchain launch is successful, with sufficient participation from users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus allows users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimum participation levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, minus network fees. This ensures that the launch of a new blockchain is successful and that users are protected in case of insufficient participation.",
