    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a PBaaS chain with a currency name that is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH. Are there any specific things I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! Currently, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, you will not be able to use that same named currency as a PBaaS chain. This is a known limitation, but it will be addressed before the mainnet release. So, for now, you'll need to choose a different name for your PBaaS chain.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks for the heads up. What about the disclaimer for using this software, and what are the terms of use? I want to make sure I understand them.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. However, permission is granted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software, as long as the enclosed copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\nIn other words, you're free to use and modify the software as you see fit, but you do so at your own risk, and the creators of the software aren't responsible if anything goes wrong. Does that make sense?",
