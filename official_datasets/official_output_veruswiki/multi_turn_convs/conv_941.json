    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API is used to retrieve a list of currencies that meet specific liquidity and reserve ratio criteria. Specifically, it returns currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, a reserve ratio greater than 10%, and have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. How can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies that have a specific market, such as BTC/ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API by running a command like `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth`. This will return a list of currencies that have a BTC/ETH market at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! What are the criteria for a currency to be included in the results of the `getcurrencyconverters` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFor a currency to be included in the results of the `getcurrencyconverters` API, it must meet the following criteria:\n\n1. It must have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve.\n2. It must have a reserve ratio greater than 10%.\n3. It must have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies that have multiple specific markets, such as BTC/ETH and LTC/USD?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies that have multiple specific markets. You can simply list the markets you're interested in, separated by spaces, as arguments to the command. For example: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth ltc usd`.",
