    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in launching a new currency on the Verus network. What are the requirements to do so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a new currency on the Verus network, the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST. Additionally, there must be 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at the specified conversion rate (in this case, 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch the currency. This process is part of the mining process, and mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new currency. Do you have any other questions about launching a new currency?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How do I convert VRSCTEST to a new currency (like GOLD) before the token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can park your conversion until the token launches by using the `sendcurrency` command with the `preconvert` option set to 1. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI understand. What happens to the conversion fees when a new currency is launched on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe conversion fees, which are 0.025% of the conversion amount, are earned by miners who participate in the launch of the new currency. They are rewarded with a portion of the conversion fees for mining the blocks that launch the currency, effectively converting VRSCTEST to the new currency. Do you have any more questions about conversion fees?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. How do I create a new currency that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can create a new currency by defining its properties using the `definecurrency` command. For example, to create a new currency called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you would need to specify the conversion rates and other properties of the currency. Do you have any other questions about creating a new currency or would you like more information on the `definecurrency` command?",
