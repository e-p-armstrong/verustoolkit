    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about the Verus software. What kind of warranty or liability does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\" without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I'm running Verus on a Linux machine, and I was wondering, what are the Linux dependencies required for Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Linux dependencies required for Verus depend on the version of Ubuntu you are using. For Ubuntu 16.04/Xenial, you need to install `libcurl4-openssl-dev` using the command `sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev`. For Ubuntu 18.04/Bionic and later, you need to install `libcurl4` using the command `sudo apt install libcurl4`.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I've also been wondering, why is it important to upgrade my VerusCoin daemon and/or Agama wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt is important to upgrade your VerusCoin daemon and/or Agama wallet to avoid disconnecting from the network. This is because the approximate release height was set too low on the last release, and upgrading will ensure that you can continue to use the network without any issues.",
