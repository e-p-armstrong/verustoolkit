    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand some concepts related to Verus signatures. Can you help me out? When the result of a signature validation is `true`, what does that mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the result of a signature validation is! `true`, it means that the signature is valid. That's a pretty straightforward answer, but let me know if you have any follow-up questions about signature validation or anything else!\n\n**User:**\nI do have another question, actually. I saw that there was an update for the Verus daemon, v0.8.0-2. What's the purpose of that update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.8.0-2 UPDATE for the Verus daemon includes a fix that simplifies some bridge transactions. It's recommended to run this update, especially when the Ethereum bridge is launched.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But why is it specifically recommended to run this update on the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRunning the v0.8.0-2 UPDATE on the testnet is recommended to ensure a good experience, particularly when the Ethereum bridge is launched. This suggests that the update is important for compatibility and smooth operation with the Ethereum bridge on the testnet. Do you have any other questions about this update or Verus in general?",
