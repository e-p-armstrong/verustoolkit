    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have a few questions about Verus. What is the expected timeline for the mainnet activation of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe mainnet activation of Verus is expected to happen at block #2549420. Before this activation, at least one more non-mandatory release is expected, which will add pool merge mining improvements. It is recommended to update to v1.0.3 or greater before the activation block. Do you have any other questions about the mainnet activation or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What are some additional capabilities of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers several additional capabilities, including on-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, on-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming, and on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles. These capabilities make Verus a powerful and versatile platform for a wide range of use cases. Do you have any questions about how these capabilities work or how they can be used?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I also had a question about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. How does that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain in a completely decentralized manner. Users can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed peer-to-peer without intermediaries, and users can choose to share proceeds with value-added agents or other participants. This marketplace provides a secure and transparent way to buy and sell unique digital assets. Do you have any other questions about the marketplace or how it works?\n\n**User:**\nLastly, I was wondering about Verus Vault. What is it, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows users to protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key. If a VerusID is locked with Vault, the funds cannot be spent until it is unlocked again. While locked, the funds can still be staked on the Verus network to earn rewards, and the user can still receive funds. This provides an additional layer of security and protection for users' assets. Do you have any other questions about Verus Vault or how it can be used?",
