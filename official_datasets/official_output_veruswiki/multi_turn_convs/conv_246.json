    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand some of the commands in Verus. Can you help me with `z_getoperationresult`? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getoperationresult` command in Verus is used to retrieve the results of specific operations, identified by their operation IDs. If no operation IDs are provided, it will examine all operations known to the node.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds useful. How can I actually use `z_getoperationresult` to retrieve the results of specific operations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_getoperationresult` command to retrieve the results of specific operations in Verus by providing a list of operation IDs as an argument. For example, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus z_getoperationresult '[\"operationid\",... ]'\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the JSON-RPC interface with curl:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_getoperationresult\", \"params\": ['[\"operationid\",... ]'] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about `z_getoperationstatus`? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getoperationstatus` command in Verus is used to retrieve the status of specific operations, along with any associated result or error data. The operation will remain in memory.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how can I use `z_getoperationstatus` to retrieve the status of specific operations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_getoperationstatus` command to retrieve the status of specific operations in Verus by providing a list of operation IDs as an argument. For example, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus '[\"operationid\",... ]'\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the JSON-RPC interface with curl:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_getoperationstatus\", \"params\": ['[\"operationid\",... ]'] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n**User:**\nThanks for explaining those. What about `z_gettotalbalance`? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_gettotalbalance` command in Verus is used to retrieve the total value of funds stored in the node's wallet.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how can I use `z_gettotalbalance` to retrieve the total balance of my wallet in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_gettotalbalance` command to retrieve the total balance of your wallet in Verus by specifying the minimum number of confirmations and whether to include watch-only addresses. For example:\n```\nverus z_gettotalbalance <minconf> <includeWatchonly>\n```\nNote that if the wallet contains any addresses for which it only has incoming viewing keys, the returned private balance may be larger than the actual balance, because spends cannot be detected with incoming viewing keys.",
