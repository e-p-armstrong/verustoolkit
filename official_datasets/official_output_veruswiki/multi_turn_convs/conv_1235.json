    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into the PBaaS blockchain launches on Verus. Can you tell me a bit more about them? What features do they offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome features of PBaaS blockchain launches on Verus include missed targets, automatic Ethereum ERC20 contract deployment, auto-created, MEV-resistant, liquidity baskets, and even auto-bridged, merge mineable, fully independent rent-free PBaaS blockchain launches. These features make it easy to launch and manage your own blockchain on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also been looking into DeFi AMM conversions on Verus. How are they verified?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, all DeFi AMM conversions are verified via mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol. This means that all conversions in a single liquidity basket are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block, resulting in all participants getting the same price in all directions of conversion, with a minimum conversion fee of 0.025% and a maximum of 0.05%. This ensures that all conversions are secure, transparent, and efficient.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been wondering, how are currencies and identities validated on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, all currencies and identities are primitives at L1 and are validated and verified on UTXO transactions, which check all inputs and outputs just as single currency L1, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin check the native currency inputs and outputs of transactions. This ensures that all transactions are secure and legitimate.\n\n**User:**\nCan currencies on Verus be sent to other networks, and if so, how?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, currencies on Verus can be sent to other networks. Once launched, all currencies on all independent connected chains can be sent back and forth to other multi-currency capable networks, including other independent PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s. This allows for seamless interaction and transfer of value between different networks.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of \"mapped currencies\" on Verus. Can you explain what those are and how they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, currencies can be defined as \"mapped currencies\", which map 1:1 to an existing currency on Ethereum (e.g. DAI). These mapped currencies can then be sent from Ethereum with simple transactions and received and used as the new \"mapped currency\", or sent back to Ethereum and used there as the original currency. This allows for easy and efficient transfer of value between different networks, without the need for complex conversions or bridges.",
