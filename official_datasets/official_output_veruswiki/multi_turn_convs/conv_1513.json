    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been hearing about the mainnet PBaaS activation. What's the significance of it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe mainnet PBaaS activation marks a major milestone for Verus, allowing people to use the platform's capabilities, including building faster, better, and more secure apps and services with features like provable identity, privacy, crowdfunded projects, and seamless integration into user interfaces. It's a big step forward for the platform!\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds exciting! What do I need to do to stay connected to the mainnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo stay reliably connected to the mainnet, it is mandatory to upgrade to version v1.0.0 or a later version before the mainnet PBaaS activation. This ensures that users can continue to use the mainnet without any issues. Make sure to upgrade to avoid any potential problems!\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about the testnet. What's its role in the Verus ecosystem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe testnet serves as a core development platform and staging area for the Verus PBaaS network. It allows developers to test and refine their projects before deploying them on the mainnet, and it will not be reset in the foreseeable future. It's a crucial part of the Verus ecosystem, providing a safe space for developers to experiment and innovate.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What benefits can users expect from building on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBuilding on Verus enables users to create faster, better, and more secure apps and services with features like provable identity, privacy, crowdfunded projects, and seamless integration into user interfaces. These capabilities allow for the creation of more robust and decentralized systems. By building on Verus, users can tap into the platform's powerful features and create innovative solutions that benefit from its strengths.",
