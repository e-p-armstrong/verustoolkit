    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I was trying to download the Verus software, but my antivirus software flagged it as a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's not uncommon. Antivirus software might flag the Verus software as a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, and some third-party installations might exploit your PC. These warnings are meant to alert you that you are installing mining software. Don't worry, as long as you're downloading from the official Verus website, the software is legitimate and safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! Speaking of which, how can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download to ensure it is legitimate and safe to use?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can follow these steps: \n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can also use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the file directly or using a checksum, respectively. This ensures that the download is legitimate and hasn't been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the deal with the txt file that comes with each Verus download? What's in it, and how can I use it to verify the download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe txt file is actually a crucial part of the verification process. It includes the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. You can use this information to verify the download by extracting the archive, verifying the signature using the extracted text file, and then extracting the archive to the desired directory. This ensures that the download is authentic and matches the expected checksum.",
