    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with creating currencies from IDs in Verus, but I've run into an issue. What is a limitation of creating a currency from an ID in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. This can cause problems when referring to the currency or identity, as the i-address will be interpreted as the calculated ID based on the name registration. Did you run into this issue while trying to create a currency?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I did. Thanks for clarifying that. I also had another question. What happens if I try to use a currency name that is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, as a PBaaS chain name in the GUI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the current testnet release, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This is a limitation that will be resolved before mainnet availability. It's good that you're testing the limits of the system, though!\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. I've previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current one, and I'm not sure what to do. What should I do if I've previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current one?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou should delete the VRSCTEST directories before running the new update. The directories to delete are:\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\nThis will ensure a clean start with the new version.",

            "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2.
