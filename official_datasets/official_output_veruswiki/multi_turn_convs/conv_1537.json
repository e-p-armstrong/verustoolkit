    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. Can you tell me more about it? How does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) directly on the blockchain. It allows users to advertise their offers to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post their sale publicly for anyone to see. Transactions are executed peer-to-peer, without the need for intermediaries, and can be made from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses.\n\nWould you like to know more about how it works or have any other questions about the marketplace?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. I've also heard about Verus Vault. What is it, and how does it protect my funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature that allows you to protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key. If you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. While locked, you can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. Additionally, you can still receive funds.\n\nDoes that sound like a useful feature to you?\n\n**User:**\nYes, it does. I'd like to know more about how to use it. What are the requirements to enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities, you need to have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. That's all you need to take advantage of these powerful features!\n\nDo you have any other questions about Verus Vault or any other Verus features?",
