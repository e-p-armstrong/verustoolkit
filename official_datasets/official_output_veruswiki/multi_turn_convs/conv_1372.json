    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there, I'm trying to learn more about using the Verus command-line interface. How can I get a list of unspent transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo get a list of unspent transactions, you can use the `listunspent` command in the Verus command-line interface. The command is:\n```\n> verus listunspent\n```\nThis command will return a list of unspent transactions. Do you have any other questions about using the Verus CLI?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! How can I view the details of a specific transaction using the Verus command-line interface?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo view the details of a specific transaction, you can use the `gettxout` command in the Verus command-line interface. The command is:\n```\n> verus gettxout \"txid\" 1\n```\nReplace `\"txid\"` with the transaction ID of the transaction you want to view, and `1` with the output index of the transaction. This will give you all the details about the specific transaction you're interested in. Do you have any other questions?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I get a hex-encoded proof that a transaction was included in a block using the Verus command-line interface?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo get a hex-encoded proof that a transaction was included in a block, you can use the `gettxoutproof` command in the Verus command-line interface. The command is:\n```\n> verus gettxoutproof [\"txid\",...] [blockhash]\n```\nReplace `[\"txid\",...]` with a JSON array of transaction IDs, and `[blockhash]` with the block hash of the block that contains the transaction. The command will return a hex-encoded proof that the transaction was included in the block. Do you have any questions about this command or its usage?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the purpose of the `gettxoutsetinfo` command in the Verus command-line interface?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `gettxoutsetinfo` command returns statistics about the unspent transaction output set. This command may take some time to execute, but it provides useful information about the unspent transactions in the blockchain. It's a great way to get an overview of the current state of the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nI was also wondering about the `gettxoutproof` command. What is the difference between using it with and without specifying a block hash?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using `gettxoutproof` without specifying a block hash, the command will only work if there is an unspent output in the UTXO for the transaction. However, if you specify the block hash of the block that contains the transaction, the command will always work, regardless of whether there is an unspent output in the UTXO. So, specifying the block hash makes the command more versatile and reliable. Do you have any more questions about using the Verus CLI?",
