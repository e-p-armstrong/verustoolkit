    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've been playing around with the Verus Desktop GUI and I was wondering about PBaaS chains. What's a limitation of using them in the current GUI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the current Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is expected to be resolved before mainnet availability. Just a heads up to keep that in mind while experimenting with PBaaS chains.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the warning. Speaking of warnings, I think I saw a disclaimer somewhere in the Verus documentation. What's the general warning or disclaimer associated with using the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, that's correct. The Verus software is still experimental and unfinished. As such, it's provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. Just a standard disclaimer to make sure users are aware of the risks involved with using unfinished software.",
