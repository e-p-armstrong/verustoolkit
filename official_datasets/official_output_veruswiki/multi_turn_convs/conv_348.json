    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been reading about the Verus chain and I saw something about a currency called RaceCondition. What happened with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe RaceCondition currency was created with a 5% algorithmically controlled fractional reserve of Verus, but it was launched with a very low reserve of only 10 VRSC and a high supply of 100 million. This led to a volatile situation where the creator of the currency exited with their entire pre-launch amount, leaving the currency with fewer reserves relative to supply than it had before.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So what was the impact of the creator of the RaceCondition currency converting all of their currency to VRSC?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the creator of the RaceCondition currency converted all of their currency to VRSC, they got the highest price they could get for their currency, but left the remaining currency holders with a highly volatile and under-reserved currency, effectively pulling off an \"exit scam\" for a total of 4 VRSC.\n\n**User:**\nI'm still a bit confused about fractional reserve currencies on Verus. Can you explain what that is and what are the risks associated with it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA fractional reserve currency on Verus is a currency that is backed by a fraction of the total supply of another currency, in this case, Verus. The risks associated with such a currency include volatility, as the value of the currency can fluctuate greatly depending on the reserve ratio and the actions of the currency creators. In extreme cases, as seen with the RaceCondition currency, it can lead to a situation where the currency creators exit with their funds, leaving the remaining currency holders with a devalued and under-reserved currency.\n\nI hope that helps clarify things!",
