    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm curious about the costs associated with VerusIDs. How much does it cost to acquire a Verus ID, and how can I get a discount?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAcquiring a Verus ID costs 100 Verus. However, you can get a discount of 20 Verus (bringing the cost down to 80 Verus) if you are referred by an existing Verus ID. So, if you know someone who already has a Verus ID, you can ask them to refer you and you'll get a discount!\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What happens to the cost of a Verus ID once it's purchased? Does it go to some central authority or corporation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the cost of a Verus ID goes back into the network, either as referral fees or as mining and staking fees. No one besides miners, stakers, or ID referrers take any proceeds from the cost of an identity. So, the community members who help maintain Verus benefit from the cost of creating an ID.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a fair system. How does the referral system for Verus IDs work, exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you refer someone new and they purchase an ID with your ID as a referral, they will receive a 20% discount on the ID. You will receive 20 Verus directly, and the person who referred you (if there is one) will also receive 20 Verus. The miner or staker will receive the remainder of the discounted 80 Verus cost. It's a win-win for everyone involved! Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or the referral system?",

The best thing about that is that regardless of how much the Verus blockchain rewards miners over and above the pre-determined coinbase reward, it will be as a result of the **on-chain economy**, paid for by people buying identities with **no inflation** of the money supply\\!
