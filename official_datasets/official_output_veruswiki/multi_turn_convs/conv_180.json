    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to learn more about updating IDs on Verus. Can you tell me about the `timelock` parameter? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `timelock` parameter can be used in two ways: to set the unlock height of an identity or to define a time delay for unlocking an ID when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n\nDo you have any more questions about updating IDs or the `timelock` parameter?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How do I lock an ID on Verus, and what are the implications of doing so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo lock an ID, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `flags` set to 2 and specify a `timelock` value. A locked ID cannot revoke itself, and revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any more questions about locking IDs?\n\n**User:**\nMoving on to APIs, what does the `getcurrencyconverters` API do on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the `getcurrencyconverters` API or would you like to know more about using it?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. How can I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies with specific market pairs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies with specific market pairs by specifying the desired currencies as arguments. For example, `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\nDoes that help? Do you have any more questions about using the `getcurrencyconverters` API?",
