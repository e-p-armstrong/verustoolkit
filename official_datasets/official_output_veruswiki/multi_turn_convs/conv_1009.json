    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to find where Verus stores some of its files. Do you know where the standard locations are for files like `Wallet.dat`, `Chaindata`, and `VRSC.conf` on different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, I can help you with that! The standard locations for Verus files are:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC`\n* On Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`\n* On Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`\n* OS independent through Verus Desktop: Click `help`, `Show Verus data folder (default)`\n\nYou should be able to find your files there. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! I also have a question about restoring my wallet from a backup. How do I restore my wallet from a backup of my `wallet.dat` file?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRestoring your wallet from a backup is a relatively straightforward process. To restore your wallet from a backup of your `wallet.dat` file, follow these steps:\n\n1. Stop verusd. For Windows-Desktop or Agama, just exit and wait for it to close completely. For the Linux CLI, run `./verus stop`, or for the Windows CLI, run `verus stop`.\n2. Copy the backup of your `wallet.dat` file from your backup location to the directory listed above (standard locations).\n3. Now restart your wallet by launching Verus Desktop, Agama, or running verusd for the CLI.\n\nThat should do it! Your wallet should now be restored from the backup. If you have any issues or concerns, feel free to ask.",
