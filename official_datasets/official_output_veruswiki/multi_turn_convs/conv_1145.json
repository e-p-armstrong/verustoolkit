    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there, I've got a few questions about Verus. What is the purpose of the testnet reset?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe testnet reset is intended to address and fix all reported issues related to PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID users. It's a way to ensure that the reported issues are resolved and to provide a stable and functional testnet environment. Do you have any further questions about the testnet reset?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. I've heard about a `getvdxfid` RPC call. What is it, and how is it used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getvdxfid` RPC call is a new feature that generates VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys, which are used to create self-sovereign, decentralized, and rent-free profiles. This call is used in conjunction with your ID and published names to create these profiles. Would you like to know more about VDXF keys and their significance?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please. What is the significance of VDXF keys, and how can they be used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVDXF keys are used to create self-sovereign, decentralized, and rent-free profiles. They enable users to have full control over their data and profiles, allowing for a more decentralized and autonomous online experience. The potential applications of VDXF keys are vast, and they can be used to create new, decentralized user experiences, applications, and businesses. Do you have any other questions about VDXF keys or their potential uses?\n\n**User:**\nI've also noticed that additional ERC20 currencies were added to the Verus ecosystem. Why was that done?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's correct! Additional ERC20 currencies were added in anticipation of increased usage after the release of the ETH bridge. This allows users to interact with more assets and take advantage of the features and capabilities of the Verus ecosystem. Do you have any further questions about the added ERC20 currencies or the Verus ecosystem in general?",

            "1. Testnet reset with fixes for all reported PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID user issues. If you had reported issues, please verify that the issues you reported are addressed in this release.\n2. Support for the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge, which has been testing on private networks and which we hope to launch within a day or two after first vetting it on the release testing network with community test volunteers.\n3. Support for the new `getvdxfid` RPC call, used along with your ID and published names to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys, which community members used to create the world\u2019s first self-sovereign, completely decentralized, rent-free, non-cancelable social media profiles as can be seen here: https://luckpool.net/profile/identity/mike.vrsc . Work is underway to document the VDXF keys defined and used for profiles as well as the process of setting up your own. While the capability is already extremely powerful, we should remind everyone that Verus is a platform, not a social network. The core technology is exciting, but what will be even more exciting is when businesses and entrepreneurs leverage it to enable new, self-sovereign user experiences, applications, and accompanying businesses to enable the future, truly decentralized web.\n4. Fix for the Electron certificate issue in the GUI wallet, which has been affecting prices and preventing BTC fee calculation.\n5. Support for some additional, popular ERC20 currencies, in anticipation of more usage after release of the ETH bridge.\n6. Fix in GUI for calculated balances of specific addresses sometimes showing lower than actual, even though wallet balance displayed correctly.\n7. Additional hardening, fixes and improvement focused on mainnet and the Ethereum bridge.",
