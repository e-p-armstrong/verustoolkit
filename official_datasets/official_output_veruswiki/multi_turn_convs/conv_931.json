    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been having some issues with my antivirus software. It keeps flagging the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAvast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is a mining software. This is not necessarily an indication of malicious intent, but rather a warning that the software has the potential to be used for unauthorized mining on your PC. You can rest assured that the Verus software is legitimate and safe to use.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been hearing that I should upgrade to Verus version 0.5.5 or greater. What's the significance of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUpgrading to Verus version 0.5.5 or greater is important because it includes a portability fix for a fault on some CPUs that did not support optimized mining. This allows mining on CPUs that don't support optimizations, although they will be relatively slow. It is recommended to upgrade as soon as possible to ensure compatibility and optimal performance. You don't want to miss out on the benefits of the latest version!\n\n**User:**\nGot it, I'll make sure to upgrade. One more question, what kind of warranty or liability does the Verus software come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software. It is experimental and unfinished software, and users are advised to use it at their own risk. Just something to keep in mind when using the software.",
