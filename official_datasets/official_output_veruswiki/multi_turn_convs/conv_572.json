    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about the Verus software. Why might my antivirus software flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! Your antivirus software might flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" because it contains mining software, which can be exploited by third parties to use your computer's resources without your consent. This is a false positive warning, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about these warnings. Don't worry, Verus is a legitimate and secure software.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can check the included `.txt` file, which contains the signer, standard SHA256 file checksum, and signature. The packages are signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". You can also use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the file directly or using a checksum. This ensures that you're getting the official and secure Verus software.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI are used to verify the authenticity of a Verus download by checking its digital signature. The `verifyfile` command verifies a file directly, while the `verifyhash` command verifies a checksum. If the signature is valid, the command will return `true`. This is an extra layer of security to ensure you're getting the genuine Verus software.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that there's a new version of the Verus CLI. What are some of the new features in Verus CLI v0.6.4?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, that's correct! Some of the new features in Verus CLI v0.6.4 include: estimated active staking supply displayed in output from `getmininginfo`, average block fees for last 100 blocks displayed in `getmininginfo` output, immature coins, including time-locked coins displayed in `coinsupply` output, eligible staking balance, with consideration for all disqualifying factors displayed in `getwalletinfo` output, `z_exportwallet` now accepts a boolean parameter to remove all addresses with no UTXOs or Identities in the backup, improved staking performance, and fixed rare condition of improper ID wallet synchronization of transferred or revoked IDs. These updates aim to provide a better user experience and more accurate information.",
