    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring the Verus network and I'm curious about creating new tokens. How can I create new tokens on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAt present, the only way to create new tokens on the Verus network is through a centralized issuance option. If you're interested in creating a new token, you'll need to explore this option.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been playing around with VRSCTEST and I was wondering, how can I convert VRSCTEST to a new token, like GOLD, using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command effectively parks your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned. Make sure to replace \"your_address@\" with your actual address. Did you have any other questions about token creation or conversion?",
