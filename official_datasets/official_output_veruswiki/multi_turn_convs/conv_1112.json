    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've heard about the new v0.9.6-2 release of Verus. What's special about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe v0.9.6-2 release of Verus is a critical update for the Verus daemon, and it's important to note that it only supports mainnet. Future versions will be released to support testnet. It's a significant update, and users should make sure to upgrade to take advantage of the latest features and security patches.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. What are some additional capabilities of Verus that I might not be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus has a lot of exciting features beyond what's immediately apparent. Some additional capabilities of Verus include on-chain launches of token, centralized currency, and liquidity basket AMMs, as well as on-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming. It also supports on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles. Verus is a very powerful and flexible platform!\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain. It allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, with the option to use transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses. It's a really innovative way to buy and sell unique digital assets.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about Verus Vault. How does it protect funds on a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a fantastic feature that allows users to lock their VerusID, protecting funds from theft even if the private key is compromised. While locked, users cannot spend funds from that identity, but they can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. They can also still receive funds. Once unlocked, the funds can be spent again. It's an added layer of security and peace of mind for users who want to ensure their funds are safe.",
