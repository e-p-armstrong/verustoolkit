    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how fees work in a new blockchain launched using Verus. How do fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or liquidity pool usage work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or liquidity pool usage in a new blockchain launched using Verus are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This allows for seamless connectivity between chains. This way, the new blockchain can maintain its autonomy and benefit from the fees generated within its ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about crowdfunding currency launches on Verus? What features does Verus offer for this, and how do refunds work if minimum participation is not met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers features for crowdfunding currency launches, including the ability to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in preferred currencies on-chain. If minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, minus network fees. Additionally, launch options can include maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Vesting schedules can also be included in pre-allocations using VerusIDs. This provides a flexible and secure way to launch new currencies and ensure that participants are protected in case the minimum participation is not met.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard about Verus's multichain network, but I'm not entirely sure what it means. Can you explain the concept of an interoperable, multichain network in Verus, and what are its benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in its network, allowing for unlimited scale and new use cases. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be merge-mined and staked, as well as private, internal blockchains. These private blockchains are easy to set up and can bridge public currencies into an organization's internal network, and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. This allows for a high degree of flexibility, scalability, and customization, making it ideal for a wide range of use cases.",
