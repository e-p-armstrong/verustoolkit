    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have some more questions about VerusIDs and currencies. What is a limitation of creating currencies from IDs in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Why is it not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt is not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name because it will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (in many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies.\n\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with the Verus Desktop GUI and I was wondering, are there any limitations in the Verus Desktop GUI when creating a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, in the current version of the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. However, this limitation is considered errata and will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\n**User:**\nBefore I start using Verus more extensively, I want to make sure I understand the risks involved. What is the disclaimer for using Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer states that Verus is experimental and unfinished software, and users should be aware that they use it at their own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage. However, the software is open-source and free to use, modify, and distribute, as long as the copyright notice and permission notice are included.",
