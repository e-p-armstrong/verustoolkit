    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand more about locking IDs. How do I lock an ID using a time lock, and what does the timelock parameter define in this case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo lock an ID using a time lock, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter set to the desired unlock block height. The `timelock` parameter defines the unlock height of the identity, which means that the ID will remain locked until the specified block height is reached.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, but I'm still a bit unclear. What is the difference between a time lock and a time delay when locking an ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA time lock defines the unlock height of the identity, whereas a time delay defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. So, in other words, a time lock sets a specific block height for the ID to unlock, while a time delay sets a delay in blocks before the ID can be unlocked.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a locked identity if it is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf a locked identity is revoked, its locked status will be cleared, regardless of any time delay or unlock height that was previously set. So, revoking an ID essentially cancels any locking or delay settings.\n\n**User:**\nCan a locked identity revoke itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a locked identity cannot revoke itself. That would kind of defeat the purpose of locking it, wouldn't it?\n\n**User:**\nMoving on to a different topic, what is the purpose of the `getcurrencyconverters` API, and what are the criteria for a currency to be included in the results?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. This API is useful for finding currencies that meet certain liquidity and reserve requirements.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really useful. How do I use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies that have a specific market, such as BTC/ETH?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to find currencies that have a specific market by specifying the desired currencies as arguments, like this:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
