    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about using Verus. What's the purpose of the `z_getbalance` command, and how can I use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getbalance` command is used to retrieve the total amount of KMD received by a specific address. You can use it by providing the address as an argument, and optionally, a minimum number of confirmations. For example, `verus z_getbalance \"myaddress\"` will return the total amount received by the address \"myaddress\", while `verus z_getbalance \"myaddress\" 5` will only include transactions confirmed at least 5 times.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. What happens if I only have an incoming viewing key for an address when using `z_getbalance`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you only have an incoming viewing key for an address when using `z_getbalance`, spends cannot be detected, and the returned balance may be larger than the actual balance. Just something to keep in mind when using the command.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. How can I generate a new shielded address for receiving payments in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can generate a new shielded address for receiving payments in Verus using the `z_getnewaddress` command. By default, it returns a Sapling address, but you can specify a different type of address, such as Sprout, by providing the type as an argument. For example, `verus z_getnewaddress sapling`. This will give you a new address that you can use to receive payments privately and securely.",
