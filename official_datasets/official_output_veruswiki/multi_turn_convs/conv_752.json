    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm about to update VRSCTEST on my system and I want to make sure I do it correctly. What should I do before running a new update of VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBefore running a new update of VRSCTEST, you should delete the following directories:\n- On Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest`\n- On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST` and `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest`\n- On Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` and `%APPDATA%\\VerusTest`\n\nThis will ensure a clean update process. Have you updated VRSCTEST before, or do you have any questions about the process?\n\n**User:**\nNo, I haven't updated it before, but I think I can handle it. Another question, what's the main feature of the Verus public testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main feature of the Verus public testnet is that it enables anyone to create new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. This allows for easy cross-chain currency conversion and sending currencies between different blockchains. It's a really powerful feature that sets Verus apart from other blockchain protocols.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really useful. How does the Verus protocol handle conversions between currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus protocol handles conversions between currencies in a fully decentralized manner. It requires a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network. The protocol calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread. This allows for seamless and efficient conversions between currencies. It's a key part of what makes Verus so powerful and flexible. Do you have any more questions about Verus or VRSCTEST?",
