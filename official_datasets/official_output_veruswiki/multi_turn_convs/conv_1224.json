    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been curious about how fees are handled on new blockchains created with Verus. Can you explain what happens to fees generated through cross-chain fee conversions or liquidity pool usage on a new blockchain created with Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAll fees generated through cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool on a new blockchain created with Verus are earned on the new blockchain itself, with no fees going back to the Verus blockchain. This allows for seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and the Verus network. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. I'm also interested in crowdfunding currency launches on Verus. How do they work, and what happens if the minimum participation level is not met?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches allow you to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimum participation level is not met by the start time of your blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, minus network fees. This way, you can ensure that your project has the necessary support before launching.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a great way to ensure success. What features are available for crowdfunding currency launches on Verus, and how can they be customized?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCrowdfunding currency launches on Verus offer various customization options, including:\n\n* Setting maximum participation levels in one or more currencies\n* Offering pre-launch discounts\n* Allocating a portion of proceeds to select IDs, which can increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies\n* Carving out proceeds for specific purposes\n* Offering pre-launch discounts for early participants\n* Including vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs\n\nThis allows you to tailor your crowdfunding campaign to your specific needs and goals. Do you have any other questions about crowdfunding on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that helps a lot. I've been wondering, what is the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and what are its benefits?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, enabling the development of new use cases and unlimited scale. This network enables decentralized, blockchain-specific bridge confirmation through Notary IDs, allowing for public blockchains to be merge-mined and staked, as well as private, internal blockchains with easy bridging of public currencies. The benefits of this network include seamless connectivity, unlimited scale, and the ability to develop new use cases. Does that make sense?",
