    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new currency in Verus and I'm not sure about the `proofprotocol` option. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `proofprotocol` option specifies the proof protocol used by the currency. In the example given, `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which corresponds to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID has the ability to mint new coins.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. But how does the controller of the chain ID actually mint new coins in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe controller of the chain ID can mint new coins by using the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command mints 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and sends them to the address \"mike@\".",
