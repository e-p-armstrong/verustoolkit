    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I need some help with generating a new VRSC address. How can I do that using the `getnewaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can generate a new VRSC address by running the `getnewaddress` command in the Verus CLI or by using the JSON-RPC API with a `curl` command. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```\n> verus getnewaddress\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getnewaddress\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\nThis will return a new VRSC address as a string. Do you have any other questions about generating new addresses or using the `getnewaddress` command?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. What is the purpose of the `getrawchangeaddress` command? Is it similar to `getnewaddress`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getrawchangeaddress` command returns a new VRSC address, but it's specifically designed for use with raw transactions, not normal transactions. This address is intended for receiving change from raw transactions. So, while both commands generate new addresses, `getrawchangeaddress` is meant for a specific use case with raw transactions, whereas `getnewaddress` is more general-purpose.\n\n**User:**\nI've also come across the `getreceivedbyaccount` command. What is it used for, and why is it deprecated?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getreceivedbyaccount` command is used to return the total amount received by addresses with a specific account in transactions with at least a specified number of confirmations. However, it's deprecated, which means it's no longer recommended for use. The account argument must be set to an empty string to represent the default account; passing any other string will result in an error. It's generally recommended to use other commands instead, as they provide more flexibility and functionality. Do you have any other questions about Verus commands or functionality?",
