    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how the costs of creating an ID on Verus are distributed. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen creating an ID on Verus, the costs are distributed as follows: 20 VRSC are sent to the referrer's ID, 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's ID, and 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID. Additionally, 20 VRSC are sent to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined. All remaining funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, but I'm still a bit unclear about what happens to the funds that aren't paid to referrers. Can you elaborate on that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAny funds that are not paid to referrers when creating an ID on Verus are distributed to miners or stakers of the blockchain. It's an incentive for them to maintain and secure the Verus network, ensuring that the ecosystem remains healthy and thriving.",
