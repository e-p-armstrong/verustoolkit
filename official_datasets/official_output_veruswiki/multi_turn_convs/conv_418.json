    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I want to know more about the warranty and guarantee of the Verus software. What kind of warranty or guarantee does it come with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. So, there is no explicit warranty or guarantee.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, but what if I encounter issues or damages while using the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. This means that the authors and copyright holders are not responsible for any issues or damages that may arise from using the software.\n\n**User:**\nI've noticed that some antivirus software flags Verus as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis is because Verus is mining software, and some antivirus software may warn users about installing mining software, as it can potentially be installed by a third party to exploit their PC. These warnings are known as \"false positives\". They're not necessarily indicating that Verus is malicious, but rather that it has the potential to be used maliciously.\n\n**User:**\nWhere can I learn more about these false positive warnings from antivirus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about false positive warnings from antivirus software at resources such as Malwarebytes' blog post on PUP.Optional.BitcoinMiner and Kaspersky's blog post on \"Not-a-virus\". These articles explain the concept of false positives and how they relate to mining software like Verus.",
