    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in using the PHP staking interface for coinshielding nodes. Can you tell me what it's for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe PHP staking interface for coinshielding nodes is a tool that allows users to stake Verus coins on a permanently running machine using the Verus CLI, instead of running the Agama GUI wallet. This makes it easier to stake your coins without having to constantly monitor the wallet.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! Where can I find the necessary files to set up the PHP staking interface for coinshielding nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find the necessary files to set up the PHP staking interface for coinshielding nodes by following these links:\n\n1. Download the latest Wallet from [https://verus.io/wallet](https://verus.io/wallet)\n2. Download the Bootstrap from [https://bootstrap.verus.io/](https://bootstrap.verus.io/)\n3. Go to Verus-Staking-CLI on GitHub at [https://github.com/kbs1/verus-staking-cli](https://github.com/kbs1/verus-staking-cli)\n\nJust follow the instructions on the GitHub page to set up the interface.\n\n**User:**\nWhat features does the PHP staking interface for coinshielding nodes offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe PHP staking interface for coinshielding nodes offers several features, including:\n\n* Automatic shielding and unshielding of coinbase (staking, solo mining)\n* Automatic tracking of total coins generated (also present in e-mail notifications)\n* Optional e-mail notifications on newly generated coins\n* Optional periodical wallet.dat backups, also as an encrypted ZIP archive\n* Optional periodical wallet balance e-mail notifications\n\nThese features make it easy to manage your staking setup and stay on top of your coin generation.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really cool. Is there anything I should keep in mind when staking with the PHP staking interface for coinshielding nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is one important consideration: it is crucial not to stake with the same `wallet.dat` on multiple nodes. This ensures that your staking setup remains secure and stable. Make sure to use a separate `wallet.dat` for each node to avoid any issues.",
