    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get a better understanding of the Verus system. How do I list the most recent transactions in the Verus system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can list the most recent transactions in the Verus system by using the `listtransactions` command. The basic format is:\n\n```\nverus listtransactions\n```\n\nThis will return a list of the most recent transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! But what if I want to list a specific range of transactions, for example transactions 100 to 120?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can list a specific range of transactions by using the `listtransactions` command with additional parameters. The format is:\n\n```\nverus listtransactions \"*\" <count> <skip>\n```\n\nIn this case, you would use:\n\n```\nverus listtransactions \"*\" 20 100\n```\n\nThis command will return transactions 100 to 120.\n\n**User:**\nIs it possible to make a JSON RPC call to list transactions? I'd rather use JSON if possible.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, it is possible to make a JSON RPC call to list transactions. The format is:\n\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"listtransactions\", \"params\": [\"*\", 20, 100] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\nThis will return the same information as the `listtransactions` command, but in a JSON format.\n\n**User:**\nI've also come across the `listunspent` command. What's the purpose of that command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listunspent` command in Verus returns an array of unspent transaction outputs with between a specified minimum and maximum number of confirmations (inclusive). You can also filter the results to only include txouts paid to specific addresses. The results are an array of objects, each containing information about the transaction output, including the txid, vout, scriptPubKey, amount, and confirmations.",
