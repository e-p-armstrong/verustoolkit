    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I just ran the `convertpassphrase` command and I'm not sure what to do with the output. What information do I need to store safely after running this command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter running `convertpassphrase`, you need to store the following information safely: `walletpassphrase`, `address`, `pubkey`, `privkey`, and `wif`. This information gives full control over the address, so it's essential to keep it secure. Make sure to store it in a safe and secure location, like an encrypted file or a password manager.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I'm a bit curious about the `wif` string, though. What is its purpose, and how do I use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `wif` string is a 52-character string that represents the private key of an address in Wallet Import Format (WIF). You need to import this string into your Verus wallet using the `importprivkey` command to gain control over the associated address. To do this, go to `settings` -> `Coin Settings`, select the desired chain, and run the command `run importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" true`, replacing `<wif>` with the actual WIF string you obtained from the `convertpassphrase` command.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But why is it so important to keep the WIF string secure?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe WIF string is equivalent to the private key of an address, and anyone with access to it will have full control over that address. Therefore, it's crucial to store the WIF string in a safe and secure location to prevent unauthorized access to your funds. If someone gets hold of your WIF string, they can use it to steal your assets or take control of your address. So, keep it safe and secure!",
