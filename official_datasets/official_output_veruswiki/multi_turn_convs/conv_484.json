    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about VerusIDs. How do I sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID in Verus, you need to follow these steps:\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'`.\n2. Get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency` and use it to get the raw hex transaction data with `verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using `verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>`.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>`.\n\nDo you have any questions about these steps or would you like clarification on any of them?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help. I'm also interested in learning more about the new Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet. What are some key features of it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers many features, including:\n1. Creation of new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming.\n2. Sending currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease.\n3. Converting currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.\n4. Accessibility from Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets.\n\nThese features make the testnet a powerful tool for exploring the possibilities of decentralized finance and multi-chain blockchain technology. Do you have any questions about these features or would you like to know more about the testnet?\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. What kind of flexibility does the Verus testnet provide for users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus testnet provides users with the ability to create and customize their own identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for various use cases, such as business, government, projects, or personal use. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and customization in how users interact with the Verus platform. With the testnet, users can experiment and innovate, creating new and innovative solutions that take advantage of the multi-chain, multi-currency, and DeFi capabilities of Verus. Does that make sense?",
