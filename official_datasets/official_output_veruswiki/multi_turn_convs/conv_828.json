    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to define a new currency in Verus and I'm not sure about the `proofprotocol` setting. What does it mean to set the `proofprotocol` to 2?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen setting the `proofprotocol` to 2, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID, which allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that helps. But how does the controller of the chain ID mint new coins in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe controller of the chain ID can mint new coins by using the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option set to 1. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command mints 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and sends them to the address \"mike@\". Do you have any other questions about defining a new currency in Verus or minting new coins?",
