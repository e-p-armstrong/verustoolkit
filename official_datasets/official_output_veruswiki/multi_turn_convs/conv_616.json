    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus IDs and I'm curious about some aspects. What makes Verus IDs quantum-ready friendly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs are quantum-ready friendly because they are resistant to quantum attacks using known algorithms. While Verus currently does not have quantum resistant signatures for transactions, the IDs themselves are secure against quantum attacks. Additionally, Verus is integrating a quantum secure signature scheme, which will allow for retroactive quantum resistance of funds sent to an ID when it becomes available. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. Another thing I've been thinking about is how Verus IDs handle changes to controlling addresses or multi-sig properties. How does that work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the controlling addresses or multi-sig properties of a Verus ID are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. This means that the controller of the identity can update the ID's settings, and all subsequent transactions will be affected by the changes. Do you have any more questions about how Verus IDs work?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I've seen it mentioned that Verus IDs are fully decentralized. What does that mean, exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs are fully decentralized because anyone can create one without needing permission, and they have complete, self-sovereign control over their ID. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers, rather than a central authority. This means that Verus IDs are truly decentralized and community-driven.\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand. One more thing I'm not entirely clear on is revocation authority in the context of Verus IDs. Can you explain that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the context of Verus IDs, revocation authority refers to the ability to revoke an ID, effectively freezing all of its funds. Each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity itself, and can be used to create a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered. This adds an extra layer of security and control to Verus IDs.",

            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerus IDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.
