    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in how Verus handles cross-chain bridging. Can you tell me what innovation Verus brings to this area?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus enables cryptographically provable, cross-chain bridging across Verus and all PBaaS and other connected blockchains in the network, either combined with or independent of the need for notary witnesses. This technology is referred to as \"auto-notarization\" or \"Proof of Proof of Power\". It's a game-changer for secure and trustworthy cross-chain transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds fascinating! How does Verus's cross-chain consensus technology work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus's cross-chain consensus technology, also known as \"auto-notarization\" or \"Proof of Proof of Power\", works by using cryptographic evidence to ensure that cross-chain transactions are secure and trustworthy. This technology allows for fast and secure transactions, even without the presence of notary witnesses. It's a remarkable achievement in the field of blockchain technology.\n\n**User:**\nI'm impressed! Is Verus's cross-chain consensus technology fully functional and secure?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhile Verus's cross-chain consensus technology is fully functional and believed to be sufficiently secure, it has not yet been proven to an academic standard. Therefore, it is recommended to consider the protocol unproven at this time and to use operational notary witnesses for serious PBaaS chains until further notice. We're confident in the technology, but we want to ensure that it's thoroughly vetted before declaring it fully secure.\n\n**User:**\nWhat role do notary witnesses play in Verus's cross-chain consensus technology?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary witnesses are used to ensure the security and trustworthiness of cross-chain transactions. They provide an additional layer of security, making it difficult for anyone, including notary witnesses themselves, to take actions that go against the wishes of the majority of the network. They're an important component of the system, and they help to ensure that transactions are secure and trustworthy.",

This technology is referred to as \"auto-notarization\" or \"Proof of Proof of Power\".",
            "4. **Bridging Blockchain Networks Without Witnesses**: v0.9.9 is the first release of any blockchain protocol anywhere that we know of which enables cryptographically provable, cross-chain bridging across Verus and all PBaaS and other connected blockchains in the network, either combined with or independent of the need for notary witnesses. With notary witnesses, cross-chain transactions complete faster, but they are also checked against cryptographic evidence, making it difficult to impossible for anyone, including notary witnesses to take any action, even colluding with validators that would go against the wishes of the most chain power. We have been referring to this new cross-chain consensus technology as \u201cauto-notarization\u201d, as that is what it actually is, but it would also be accurate to call it Proof of Proof of Power, as that is how it works. For purposes of ensuring everyone understands the state of the technology, it is fully functional and we have taken great care to ensure it is sufficiently secure, but we have not yet had the protocol proven to an academic standard. Because of that, while it provides a security fall-back against misbehaving notary witnesses and will be fully functional and we believe sufficiently secure without notary witnesses on release, we currently recommend toconsider the protocol unproven at this time and that any serious PBaaS chains be launched with operational notary witnesses until further notice.",
