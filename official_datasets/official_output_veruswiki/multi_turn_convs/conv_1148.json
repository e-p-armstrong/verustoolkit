    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been using Verus for a while now, and I just updated to the latest version. I had previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current one. What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current one, you should delete the following directories before running the new update:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nThis will ensure a clean start with the new version. Did you have any issues during the update process?\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help. I was also wondering, what's the disclaimer for using Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe disclaimer for using Verus software is that it is experimental and unfinished, and you use it at your own risk.
