    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been following the recent updates on Verus and I'm curious about some of the changes. What were some issues resolved in a recent Verus release related to PBaaS chain launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTwo issues were resolved: one that prevented no-reward chains with initial emission from being accepted, and another that could allow a chain launch to go forward even when a co-launched liquidity basket failed to get enough participation. These fixes should help ensure a smoother experience for users launching chains on PBaaS.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I've been experimenting with testnet and I'm wondering, what's the impact of updating to v0.9.2 on testnet data?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you have already used testnet with versions prior to v0.9.2, you need to delete and clear any existing testnet data folders. However, if you have already gone through the testnet reset process on any version since v0.9.2, you do not need to reset testnet. Just a heads up to make sure everything runs smoothly.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that v0.9.2 brings some new capabilities. Can you tell me more about what's new?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nv0.9.2 adds a complete set of new capabilities that enable branded sub-ID issuance with both decentralized and centralized options, as well as novel solutions for royalty and IP licensing business models. This opens up a lot of possibilities for users and businesses alike.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the status of the Verus network, PBaaS, VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith v0.9.2, the Verus network, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols are considered feature complete for the coming mainnet PBaaS upgrade. This is a major milestone for the project!\n\n**User:**\nWhat's next for the core developers now that the protocols are feature complete?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe core developer focus is now on protocol hardening and enabling usage, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets, as well as merge mining for pool servers. They're shifting their attention to making the protocols more robust and user-friendly.",
