    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been hearing some rumors about changes coming to the Verus Mainnet Protocol. Can you tell me what's happening and when?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Mainnet Protocol is indeed upgrading to incorporate new features and improvements. This upgrade is scheduled to take place at block 1053660. It'll bring some exciting changes, including support for season 4 Komodo notary node operators, updates to staking and mining, and refinements to the Verus Proof of Power consensus protocol.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds like a lot of changes! What are some of the new features and changes that will be introduced with the Verus Mainnet Protocol upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome of the key highlights include added support for season 4 Komodo notary node operators, removal of the requirement for coinbase shielding on unshielded coinbases from the past, and staking will now work on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds. Additionally, there's a new `sendcurrency` API for the command line, which provides more control when sending from and to multiple addresses or identities. There are also updates to the `updateidentity` command, revocation identity, and staking and hashing consensus protocol updates with VerusHash 2.2.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if I don't upgrade to the new Verus Mainnet Protocol by the deadline?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you're running in native mode and don't upgrade to the new Verus Mainnet Protocol by the deadline, you may need to resynchronize the blockchain. This is to ensure that your node is compatible with the new protocol and can continue to function properly.\n\n**User:**\nI saw something about a `sendcurrency` API. What's the purpose of that, and how does it improve the functionality of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API provides more control when sending from and to multiple addresses or identities. This allows for more flexibility and precision when transferring funds, making it easier to manage complex transactions and identities.\n\n**User:**\nHow does the Verus Mainnet Protocol upgrade affect the use of IDs for storing and staking funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith the upgrade, staking will now work on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds. This allows users to take full advantage of the benefits of using IDs, such as increased security and flexibility.",
