    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about using the `sendcurrency` command. What happens when I use it to convert VRSCTEST to a new token, like GOLD, before the token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you use the `sendcurrency` command to convert VRSCTEST to a new token before the token launches, the conversion is effectively parked until the token launches. Once the token launches, you will either find the converted amount of the new token (e.g., 0.975 GOLD) in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nSo, essentially, your conversion is put on hold until the new token is launched, and then it's either successful and you get the new token, or it's not successful and you get your original VRSCTEST back. Does that make sense? Do you have any other questions about using `sendcurrency` or converting tokens?",
