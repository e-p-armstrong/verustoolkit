    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and I'm curious about some of its features. Can you tell me about Verus Fee Pooling technology? What is it and how does it address concerns about blockchain security and fee distribution?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Fee Pooling technology is a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model that strengthens blockchain security by preserving the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time. In this model, all fees from transactions in a block are gathered and added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees. The current block miner or staker then takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.\n\nThis approach addresses concerns about blockchain security and fee distribution by providing a more stable and predictable revenue stream for miners and stakers, which in turn helps to secure the network. It also reduces the volatility of fees and incentivizes miners and stakers to prioritize transactions with higher fees, leading to a more efficient and secure network.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. Another feature I've come across is Verus Vault. Can you tell me more about it and how it enhances identity management and enables new use cases?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a capability introduced on the Verus testnet that provides advanced time locking of identities. It enables a theft-resistant workflow of identity management and unlocks various use cases such as trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, estate planning, and more. When combined with the revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID, Verus Vault has immense ramifications for secure and flexible identity management.\n\nIn essence, Verus Vault allows users to set specific time locks on their identities, which can only be accessed or modified after a certain period of time. This provides an added layer of security and control over one's identity, and enables a range of new use cases that were previously not possible.\n\nFor example, Verus Vault could be used to create a trust fund that can only be accessed by the beneficiary after a certain age, or to set up a vesting schedule for employee stock options. It's a powerful tool that enhances the flexibility and security of identity management on the Verus network.",

In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
