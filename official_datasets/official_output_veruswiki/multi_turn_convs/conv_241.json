    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm playing around with creating IDs in Verus and I had a question. What's a potential issue with creating an ID with an i-address as its name, and how can I avoid it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGood question! Creating an ID with an i-address as its name can cause problems when trying to use that ID as a currency, as the i-address will be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. To avoid this issue, it is recommended not to create IDs with i-addresses as their names. So, just be mindful of that when creating your IDs!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. I also had a question about creating a PBaaS chain in the Verus Desktop GUI. Why can't I use existing currency names, such as BTC or ETH, as a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good question. This is a limitation in the current version of the Verus Desktop GUI, but it is considered errata and will be resolved before the mainnet release. For now, you cannot use existing currency names as a PBaaS chain in the GUI. But don't worry, this will be fixed soon!\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the clarification. One last question: what should I keep in mind when using this software, and what kind of warranty or support can I expect?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nImportant question! This software is experimental and unfinished, so you should use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and you should be aware that the software is still in development and may have limitations or issues. Just be careful and keep that in mind when using it.",
