    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nYou mentioned earlier that VerusIDs are \"quantum-ready friendly\". Can you explain what makes them so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are \"quantum-ready friendly\" because they are resistant to quantum attacks using known algorithms. Although Verus currently does not have quantum-resistant signatures for transactions, the IDs themselves are secure against quantum attacks. Furthermore, Verus is integrating a quantum secure signature scheme, which will make it possible to change an ID and have all funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about changes to controlling addresses or multi-sig properties of a VerusID? How are those handled?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the controlling addresses or multi-sig properties of a VerusID are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity will follow the updated spend conditions and be subject to the updated keys. This means that the identity's controller has full control over the ID and can update its settings as needed.\n\n**User:**\nYou've mentioned a few times that VerusIDs are a fully decentralized protocol. What does that mean, exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are a fully decentralized protocol because anyone can create one without needing permission, and the creator has complete, self-sovereign control over it. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers, ensuring that the protocol is community-driven and decentralized.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. What does it mean for a VerusID to be revocable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA VerusID being revocable means that each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. This authority has the permission to revoke the identity, effectively freezing all of its funds until it is recovered. This feature is useful in cases like key theft, where the identity needs to be frozen to prevent unauthorized access.",

            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so.

VerusIDs are:- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.",
