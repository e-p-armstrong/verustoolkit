    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've downloaded Verus, but I want to make sure it's authentic. How do I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you need to follow three steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nThe text file contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, which can be used to verify the download. The packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". This ensures that the download is genuine and has not been tampered with.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great! I'd like to verify a file directly using the Verus CLI. How can I do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can verify a file directly using the Verus CLI with the following command:\n\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"signature\" \"/path/to/file\"\n```\n\nReplace \"signature\" with the actual signature from the text file, and \"/path/to/file\" with the path to the file you want to verify. This will verify the file's authenticity using the signature.\n\n**User:**\nAlternatively, can I verify a file using a checksum with the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can verify a file using a checksum with the Verus CLI with the following command:\n\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"signature\" \"checksum\"\n```\n\nReplace \"signature\" with the actual signature from the text file, and \"checksum\" with the actual checksum of the file you want to verify. If the signature is valid, the result will be \"true\".\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that there's a mandatory mainnet upgrade in Verus. What's the purpose of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA mandatory mainnet upgrade in Verus is necessary to correct errors or vulnerabilities in the network that could cause issues with cross-chain challenges. In this case, a numeric function used in cross-chain challenges was incorrect and needed to be updated to ensure the integrity of the network. The upgrade is necessary to prevent potential failures of cross-chain challenges and blockages of bridges. This upgrade ensures that the Verus network remains secure and functional.",
