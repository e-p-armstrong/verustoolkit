    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new currency with Verus, and I'm not sure about one of the settings. What does it mean to set `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency with Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new currency, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins of that currency. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about creating a new currency with Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! Now I'm wondering, how can I mint new coins of a currency that I have defined with PROOF_CHAINID as the proof protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo mint new coins of a currency that you have defined with PROOF_CHAINID as the proof protocol, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command would mint 10,000 new coins of the \"mycoin\" currency and send them to the address \"mike@\". Make sure to replace the example values with your own currency name, address, and amount. Do you have any other questions about minting new coins or using the `sendcurrency` command?",
