    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a question about creating a new currency on Verus. How can I define a new currency, like \"gold@\", on Verus, and map it to a specific, auditable store of gold?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo define a new currency like \"gold@\" on Verus, you can use the `definecurrency` command with specific options. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency called \"gold\" with specific conversion rates and pre-allocation options. Note that the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate the currency launch.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But what are the requirements for launching a new currency like \"gold@\" on Verus, and how do miners benefit from the launch process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a new currency like \"gold@\" on Verus, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST, and then send a transaction to initiate the currency launch. The launch process requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be pre-converted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD. Miners benefit from the launch process by earning 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, which are earned by mining the blocks that launch the currency.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And what if I want to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches? How can I do that, and what will happen when the token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD before the GOLD token launches by using the `sendcurrency` command with the `convertto` option. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. When the token launches, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.",
