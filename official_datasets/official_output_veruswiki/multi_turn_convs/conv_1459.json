    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about DeFi and MEV. How does the Verus DeFi protocol address the issues of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running in currency conversions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol addresses the issues of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also been looking into the bridge converter liquidity pool that's launched alongside a new blockchain on the Verus platform. What's a key feature of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA key feature of the bridge converter liquidity pool launched alongside a new blockchain on the Verus platform is that all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, while maintaining seamless connectivity.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also interested in crowdfunding currency launches on the Verus platform. How does Verus ensure minimum participation in a crowdfunding currency launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus platform ensures minimum participation in a crowdfunding currency launch by allowing users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what launch options are available for crowdfunding currency launches on the Verus platform?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe launch options available for crowdfunding currency launches on the Verus platform include setting maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, and similarly price-neutral carve-outs.",
