            "What is the purpose of a locked VerusID, and how can it be revoked and recovered?",
            "A locked VerusID provides an additional layer of security to protect your funds. It can be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which can circumvent the lock. This means that if an unauthorized unlock occurs, the revocation authority can quickly revoke and recover the ID, preventing any unauthorized access to the funds.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyoe with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.

            "How does a locked VerusID prevent the \"5-dollar wrench attack\"?",
            "A locked VerusID with a predetermined unlock time (e.g., 24 hours) provides a decentralized solution to the \"5-dollar wrench attack\". In this scenario, even if an attacker gains access to the primary keys, they would need to wait for the unlock time to pass before they can spend or access the funds. This allows the revocation authority to detect and respond to the unauthorized unlock, preventing the attack.",
