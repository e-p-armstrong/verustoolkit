            "To define a currency on Verus, you can use the `definecurrency` command. You need to provide information such as the name of the currency, options, currencies that can be converted to, conversion rates, minimum pre-conversion amounts, and pre-allocations (if any). Here's an example of how to define a currency:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\n\nIn this example, the currency is named \"gold\", and it can be converted to/from VRSCTEST at a rate of 0.01. The minimum pre-conversion amount is 1000, and 50,000,000 units are pre-allocated to the ID \"mike@\".",
