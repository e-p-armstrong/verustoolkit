            "This error message is likely due to attempting to move coinbase coins without following Verus blockchain rules. To resolve this, you need to shield your coinbase coins by moving them through a private address (zaddress) first. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a private address (starting with `zs`) in the \"Receive\" screen.\n2. Copy the new private address to your clipboard.\n3. Go to the \"Mining\" screen, select Verus, and select \"Shield Rewards\".\n4. Leave \"All unshielded funds\" as the source and paste the new zaddress into the destination.\n5. Click on \"Continue\".\n6. Wait until you have a private balance showing on the Wallet screen.\n7. Send again, this time from your private address to any normal transparent receive address that you have.",
