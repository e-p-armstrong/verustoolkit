            "How can digital signatures, specifically Verus ID signatures, be used to establish authenticity and counter the potential for deep-fakes?",
            "Verus ID signatures can be used to sign digital content such as photos, videos, and documents, allowing the creator to establish a reputation for authenticity. This prevents deep-fakes from making it harder to find the truth, as the signature serves as proof of the content's origin and integrity.",
            "For example, using Verus ID signatures, it\u2019s possible for any journalist anywhere to sign photos, videos, and content, establish a reputation for authenticity, and counter the potential for deep-fakes to make the truth harder to find. Open source projects can now create their own identities and digitally sign their binary releases, ensuring that not only can a file be verified by hash as the one downloaded from a particular server, but by signature as the actual file initially signed by the developer or release engineer. Signatures also form the basis for any attestation of one party to the validity of another. In fact, there are so many applications for digital signatures, from things listed already, to physical entry systems, to workflow applications, to new earning opportunities that a full discussion of use cases would overwhelm these release notes.\n\nIn any case, we are happy to release digital signatures for all, and we hope you enjoy using this new, simple capability, maybe even think of a new use case you\u2019d like to pursue yourself as a business opportunity on the Verus Network!",

            "Digital signatures enable open source projects to create their own identities and digitally sign their binary releases. This allows users to verify the authenticity of a file not only through its hash but also through the signature of the developer or release engineer who initially signed it.",
