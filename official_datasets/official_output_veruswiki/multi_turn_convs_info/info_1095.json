            "What is the Verus DeFi Testnet, and how does it differ from the mainnet?",
            "The Verus DeFi Testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network that allows users to test and experiment with new DeFi features and protocols before they are released on the mainnet. Unlike the mainnet, the testnet currencies and assets have no value and may be reset at any time for testing purposes.",
            "## The Verus DeFi Testnet -- THERE IS NO TESTNET RESET\nAll new 'sendcurrency' features described above now work on both mainnet and testnet. In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well.This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever released, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it\u2019s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel. You can use this link as an invite to the Verus Discord: https://discord.gg/gecZsCf",
