            "How can I lock and unlock IDs in Verus, and what are the different types of locks available?",
            "In Verus, you can lock and unlock IDs using the `updateidentity` command. There are two types of locks available: Time Lock and Time Delay. A Time Lock sets the unlock height of the identity, while a Time Delay sets a delay in blocks before the ID can be unlocked again after the flags are set back to an unlocked state. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. Additionally, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.",
