            "What does the `definecurrency` command do in Verus, and how can I use it to create a new token?",
            "The `definecurrency` command in Verus is used to create a new token with specific properties. For example, the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":96, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"conversions\":[0.01, 1.0],\"minpreconversion\":[1000,1000]}'\n```\ndefines a new token called \"mycoin\" with the following properties:\n\n* `options`: an integer value that determines the behavior of the token\n* `proofprotocol`: set to 2, which means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins\n* `currencies`: a list of currencies that \"mycoin\" can be converted to/from\n* `conversions`: a list of conversion rates between \"mycoin\" and the listed currencies\n* `minpreconversion`: a list of minimum amounts required for conversion between \"mycoin\" and the listed currencies",
            "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":96, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"conversions\":[0.01, 1.0],\"minpreconversion\":[1000,1000]}'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.

            "What does it mean when `proofprotocol` is set to 2 in a token definition?",
            "When `proofprotocol` is set to 2 in a token definition, it means that the token uses the PROOF_CHAINID proof protocol. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new tokens. For example, in the case of \"mycoin\", the controller can mint new tokens using the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command mints 10,000 new \"mycoin\" tokens and sends them to the address \"mike@\".",
