            "Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today's decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways. It provides an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.",
            "As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today\u2019s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID\n- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.\n## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)\n- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user\u2019s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be impleme",

            "The Verus testnet has several unique capabilities, including:\n\n1. Self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable identities (VerusID) that enable permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses.\n2. Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault) that enables identities to be locked, preventing funds from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds.",

            "VerusID identities are self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable, which means that users have full control over their identities and funds addresses. They can register friendly name strong identities and funds addresses without needing permission, and they can revoke and recover their identities if needed. This provides a high level of security and flexibility.",
