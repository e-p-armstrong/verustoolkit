            "If you're still experiencing issues with your wallet after following the standard procedure, you may need to completely reset your wallet. This involves editing your `VRSC.conf` file, stopping Verus, backing up your `wallet.dat` file, and then restarting your wallet.",

Open your `VRSC.conf` file for editing.\n2. Add a line to `VRSC.conf` containing\n (mac or linux)\n `exportdir=/home/<username>/`\n (or on windows)\n `exportdir=c:\\Users<username>\\Desktop\\`\n3. Save the file and stop verusd for Windows-Desktop or Agama, just exit and wait for it to close completely. For the linux cli run `./verus stop`, or for the windows cli run `verus stop`.\n4. Once your wallet is finished closing make a backup of your `wallet.dat` file somewhere safe. `wallet.dat` is located in the same directory as your configuration file (see above). To make the backup just copy it to another directory, make sure to leave the original there for the time being.\n5. Now restart your wallet by launching Verus Desktop, Agama or running verusd for the CLI.\n6. Now we'll export the wallet (this produces a different kind of file from what we did above).",
