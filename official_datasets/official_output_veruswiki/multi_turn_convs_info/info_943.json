            "How do I lock an ID in Verus, and what is the purpose of the \"timelock\" parameter?",
            "To lock an ID in Verus, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the \"timelock\" parameter. The \"timelock\" parameter defines the unlock height of the identity, which is the block height at which the ID will be unlocked.\n\nFor example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```",
