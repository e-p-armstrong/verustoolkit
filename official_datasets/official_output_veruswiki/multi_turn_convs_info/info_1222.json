            "Verus Vault's time-locking capability can be used for various purposes, such as providing time-locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structuring time-locked deal and payment terms. Additionally, it can be used to provide standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down.",
