            "To lock an ID in Verus, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter. The `timelock` parameter defines the unlock height of the identity, which means that the ID will be locked until the specified block height is reached. This can be used to restrict access to the ID until a certain condition is met.",

            "When updating an ID in Verus, a time lock defines the unlock height of the identity, while a time delay defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. In other words, a time lock sets a specific block height for the ID to unlock, while a time delay sets a delay period before the ID can be unlocked.",
