            "Why might my antivirus software flag the Verus software as a virus or malware?",
            "Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program). This is because Verus is a mining software, and some antivirus programs may warn users about installing mining software, as it could potentially be used by third parties to exploit their PC.",
