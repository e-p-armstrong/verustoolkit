            "What happens to the price of a currency when it is converted from or to reserves, and how does the reserve ratio affect this?",
            "When a currency is converted from or to reserves, its price will rise or fall based on a reversible formula. The level of volatility in this price change is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve. A currency with a lower reserve ratio, such as 0.1 or 10%, will experience more rapid price changes when converted to or from its reserve, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit.",
            "The initial price in reserve at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the early blocks that will come in as reserve currency. All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve.
