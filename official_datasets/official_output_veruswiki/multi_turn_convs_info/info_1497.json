            "What is the purpose of a revocation and recovery authority in a locked VerusID?",
            "The revocation and recovery authority in a locked VerusID allows the specified identities to revoke and recover the locked ID, even if it has been unlocked by someone with the primary keys. This provides an additional layer of security and decentralized funds recovery.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",

            "How does Verus Vault protect against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\"?",
            "Verus Vault protects against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" by allowing users to set a time lock on their IDs, which requires a predetermined unlock time before funds can be accessed. This time lock can be set to a period of time, such as 24 hours, giving the revocation and recovery authority time to detect and respond to any unauthorized unlock attempts.",
