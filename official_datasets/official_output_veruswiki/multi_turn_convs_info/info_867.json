            "How does a locked VerusID protect against unauthorized access, and what role do revocation and recovery authority identities play in this process?",
            "A locked VerusID can be protected against unauthorized access by setting a predetermined unlock time, which requires anyone with the primary keys (including multisig primary keys) to wait before they can spend or access funds. Meanwhile, the revocation and recovery authority identities can always revoke and recover the ID, circumventing the lock. This allows for decentralized funds recovery and protection against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\".",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs.
