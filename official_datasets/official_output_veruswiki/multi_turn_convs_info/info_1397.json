            "Why might my antivirus software flag the Verus software as malicious?",
            "Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because Verus is a mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, these warnings are false positives and do not indicate that the software is malicious.",
