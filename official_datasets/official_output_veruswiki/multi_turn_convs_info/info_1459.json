            "What are some limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus?",
            "There are a few limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus. One limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. It's generally not recommended to do this, as it can cause problems when using i-addresses or names. Additionally, in the GUI, you cannot use the same name as a supported currency (such as BTC or ETH) as a PBaaS chain.",
            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
