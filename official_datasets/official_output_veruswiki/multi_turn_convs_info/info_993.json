            "What is the purpose of a locked VerusID, and how does it provide protection against unauthorized access?",
            "A locked VerusID provides an additional layer of security by introducing a delay between the time the ID is unlocked and when the funds can be accessed. This delay allows the revocation and recovery authority identities to detect and respond to unauthorized unlock attempts, effectively preventing theft or loss of funds. Even with a multisig of primary keys, the unlock delay must be waited out before funds can be accessed, giving the revocation and recovery authorities time to intervene if necessary.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.

            "How does Verus Vault protect against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\"?",
            "Verus Vault protects against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" by allowing users to set a lock on their IDs with a predetermined unlock time. This means that even if an attacker gains physical access to the user's device or private keys, they will still need to wait for the unlock time to expire before they can access the funds. Meanwhile, the revocation and recovery authorities can detect the unauthorized unlock attempt and recover the funds, preventing the attacker from stealing them.",
