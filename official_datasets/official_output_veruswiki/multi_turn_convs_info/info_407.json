            "When launching a new blockchain, Verus allows for the simultaneous launch of a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This bridge converter liquidity pool runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This provides seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and the Verus ecosystem.",
