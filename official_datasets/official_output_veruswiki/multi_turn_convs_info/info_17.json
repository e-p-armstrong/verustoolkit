            "How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?",
            "To verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can follow these steps:\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file, which contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the signature. The `verifyfile` command takes the signer's identity, signature, and file path as arguments, while the `verifyhash` command takes the signer's identity, signature, and file checksum as arguments. If the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.",
