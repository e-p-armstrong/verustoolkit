            "Why do some antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?",
            "Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive warning, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these warnings.",
