            "What are the three authorities involved in a VerusID, and what are their roles?",
            "The three authorities involved in a VerusID are:\n\n1. **Primary Authority**: The primary authority is the identity itself, which has control over its own data and transactions.\n2. **Revocation Authority**: The revocation authority can revoke the primary identity, revoking access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it cannot spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n3. **Recovery Authority**: The recovery authority can redefine or recover a revoked identity, but it cannot change the revocation authority, nor can it modify an unrevoked identity at all.",
            "y except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.\n  - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n  - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.\n3. Identities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party\u2019s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.\n4. If an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using `z_getbalance identity@\u201d`.\n5. If later, a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure s added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well. That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.",

            "Can a VerusID be transferred to another party, and what happens to the funds and authorities associated with it?",
            "Yes, a VerusID can be transferred to another party by defining it with primary addresses with private keys, which are under the control of the new party. When an identity is transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so. Additionally, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred.",
