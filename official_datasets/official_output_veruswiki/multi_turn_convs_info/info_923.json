            "How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download?",
            "You can verify the authenticity of a Verus download by following these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command to verify the signature. These commands take three arguments: the identity of the signer, the signature, and the file or hash to verify.",
