            "During the synchronization process, your wallet balances will adjust as the chain syncs. The balance will only reflect the transactions that have happened in the blocks that have been received and scanned, so it won't show an accurate balance until you are fully synced.",
            "Depending on the number of addresses in your wallet and how far along you are on re-syncing, this may take several minutes to complete. Your balances will adjust as the chain syncs, as it only knows about the transactions that have happened in the blocks it has received and scanned. That means your balance will adjust as new blocks are scanned and won't reflect an accurate balance until you are fully synced.\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-11-11.",
