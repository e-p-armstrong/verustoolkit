            "How can I sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID in Verus?",
            "To sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID in Verus, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction using the `sendcurrency` command and get the raw transaction data.\n2. Use the `z_getoperationstatus` command to get the operation ID and raw hex transaction data.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n4. Use the `signrawtransaction` command to sign the raw hex transaction data in each wallet.\n5. After all necessary signatures are applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command.",
