            "To sign transactions from a multi-signature ID, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency`.\n2. Get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency` and use it with `verus z_getoperationstatus` to retrieve the raw hex transaction data.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using `verus signrawtransaction`.\n4. Once the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.",
