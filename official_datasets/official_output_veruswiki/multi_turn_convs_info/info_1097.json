            "How do I sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID on the Verus testnet or mainnet?",
            "To sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction using `verus sendcurrency` and get the raw transaction data.\n2. Use `verus z_getoperationstatus` to get the operation ID and raw hex transaction data.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n4. Use `verus signrawtransaction` to sign the raw hex transaction data in each wallet.\n5. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.",
