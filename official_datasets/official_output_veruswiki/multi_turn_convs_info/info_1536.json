            "What is unique about the launch of a new blockchain on the Verus network?",
            "When launching a new blockchain on the Verus network, it is possible to simultaneously launch a fully decentralized or centralized bridge converter liquidity pool. This liquidity pool is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain.",
            "ols.\n### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as",
