            "How can I sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID using the Verus command line?",
            "To sign a transaction from a multi-signature ID, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using `verus sendcurrency` and `verus z_getoperationstatus`.\n2. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n3. Use `verus signrawtransaction` to sign the raw hex transaction data in each wallet.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction`.",
