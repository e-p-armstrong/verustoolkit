            "When launching a currency on Verus, some key features include:\n\n* Kickstarter-like minimums to activate a currency, with automatic refunds if the minimum is not met\n* Dynamic pricing based on participation\n* Pre-launch participation price discounts\n* Pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts\n* Price-neutral launch pre-allocations\n\nAll of these features can be specified using easy-to-understand commands and parameters, without requiring any programming knowledge.",
