            "What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does it enable transactions?",
            "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly with each other, without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are executed peer-to-peer, allowing users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post their sale on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Payments can be made from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, and owners can still select and share proceeds with value-added agents or other participants in the digital ownership economy.",
