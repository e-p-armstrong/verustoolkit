            "Why might some antivirus software (like Avast and Kaspersky) flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?",
            "Some antivirus software may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC. This is a false positive warning, and the software itself is not malicious. The warnings are simply informing the user that the software is capable of mining, which could be used maliciously if installed by a third party without the user's knowledge or consent.",
