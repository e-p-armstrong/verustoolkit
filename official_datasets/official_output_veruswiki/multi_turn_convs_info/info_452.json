            "The Verus network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, each with its own notary IDs for decentralized bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be merge-mined and staked, as well as private, internal blockchains that can easily bridge public currencies into an organization's internal network. The Verus network has a fractal model, allowing for an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains with some overhead for cross-notarization.",

Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access.

            "You can lock and unlock IDs on the Verus network using the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter. The `timelock` parameter defines the unlock height of the identity for time locks, or the number of blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state for time delays. Additionally, revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height, and a locked identity cannot revoke itself.",
