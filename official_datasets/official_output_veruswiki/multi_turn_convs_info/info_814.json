            "How can I register a name commitment in Verus using the command line?",
            "You can register a name commitment in Verus using the `registernamecommitment` command. The syntax for this command is:\n\n`registernamecommitment \"name\" \"controladdress\" (\"referralidentity\") (\"parentnameorid\") (\"sourceoffunds\")`\n\nThis command registers a name commitment, which is a required step before registering an identity. The name commitment hides the actual name while ensuring that miners cannot front-run the name registration unless they have also registered a name commitment for the same name.",

            "Why is registering a name commitment necessary in Verus?",
            "Registering a name commitment is necessary in Verus because it prevents miners from front-running the name registration. By registering a name commitment, you ensure that miners cannot register the same name unless they have also registered a name commitment for that name or are willing to forfeit the offer of payment for the chance to register the name in the future. This adds an extra layer of security and fairness to the name registration process.",
