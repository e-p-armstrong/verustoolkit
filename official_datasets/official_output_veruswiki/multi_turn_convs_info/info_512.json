            "How can I optimize my mining setup to prioritize other system processes while still mining Verus?",
            "To optimize your mining setup, you can use the `nice` command to prioritize other system processes. Add `nice -n 19` before your mining command, for example:\n```\nnice -n 19./ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -t 6\n```\nThis will allow your system to prioritize other processes over mining.",
