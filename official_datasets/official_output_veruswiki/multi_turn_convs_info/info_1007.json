            "Verus allows any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can interact with the Verus chain. This blockchain can be 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant, and can send and receive from the Verus chain.",

All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon.

The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain.
