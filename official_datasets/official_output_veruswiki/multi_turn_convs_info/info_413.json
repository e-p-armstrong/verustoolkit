            "How do I sign transactions from a multi-signature ID on Verus, and what are the steps involved?",
            "To sign transactions from a multi-signature ID on Verus, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using the `sendcurrency` command, specifying the multi-signature ID and the destination address and amount.\n2. Use the `z_getoperationstatus` command to get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data and share it with each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n4. Use the `signrawtransaction` command to sign the raw hex transaction data with each additional wallet.\n5. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command.",
