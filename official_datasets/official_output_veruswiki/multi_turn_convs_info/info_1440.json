            "What is the purpose of a locked VerusID, and how can it be recovered in case of unauthorized access?",
            "A locked VerusID provides an additional layer of security by introducing a delay before funds can be spent or accessed. This delay allows the revocation and recovery authority identities to detect and respond to unauthorized unlocks, effectively preventing theft. In the event of unauthorized access, the revocation and recovery authority identities can revoke and recover the locked ID, circumventing the lock.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.
