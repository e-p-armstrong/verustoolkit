            "What kind of blockchains can be set up using Verus, and how do they interact with each other?",
            "Verus allows for the setup of both public and private, internal blockchains. These private blockchains are easy to set up and can be bridged with public currencies, allowing for the transfer of assets between the public and private networks. The Verus network can support an unlimited number of simultaneously operating and interoperable blockchains, with some overhead for cross-notarization.",
            " well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n#### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g.

            "How can I lock an ID in Verus, and what are the different types of locks available?",
            "In Verus, you can lock an ID using the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter. There are two types of locks available: Time Lock and Time Delay. Time Lock sets the unlock height of the identity, while Time Delay sets a delay in blocks before the ID can be unlocked after its flags are set back to an unlocked state. Additionally, revoking an identity will clear its locked status, and a locked identity cannot revoke itself.",

You can use this API to find currencies that have markets with specific pairs, such as BTC/ETH, at or above the liquidity threshold.
