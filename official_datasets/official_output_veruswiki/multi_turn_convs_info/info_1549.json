            "What is the purpose of a locked VerusID, and how can it be protected from unauthorized access?",
            "A locked VerusID is a secure way to store funds and assets on the blockchain. It can be protected from unauthorized access by setting a predetermined unlock time, during which the funds cannot be spent or accessed. This allows the owner to have time to react in case of an unauthorized unlock attempt. Additionally, the revocation and recovery authority identities can always revoke and recover the locked VerusID, circumventing the lock.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.

            "How does Verus Vault provide protection against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\"?",
            "Verus Vault provides protection against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\" by allowing users to set a unlock delay on their locked IDs. This means that even if an attacker gains access to the primary keys, they will have to wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access the funds. This gives the owner or a designated revocation authority time to react and prevent the unauthorized access.",
