            "What is the purpose of a revocation and recovery authority identity in a locked VerusID?",
            "The revocation and recovery authority identities in a locked VerusID allow the owner to circumvent the lock and recover the ID in case of unauthorized access or loss. This provides an added layer of security and decentralized fund recovery.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.

            "How does a locked VerusID protect against the 5-dollar wrench attack?",
            "A locked VerusID can be set up with a predetermined unlock delay, such as 24 hours, which prevents unauthorized access even if the primary keys are compromised. This allows the owner or a designated revocation authority to detect and respond to unauthorized unlock attempts, effectively preventing the 5-dollar wrench attack.",
