            "The mainnet PBaaS activation marks a major milestone for Verus, allowing people to use the platform's capabilities, including building faster, better, and more secure apps and services with features like provable identity, privacy, crowdfunded projects, and seamless integration into user interfaces.",
            "Once we are live on mainnet and people can actually use all of this themselves, along with every project, chain and currency on the PBaaS network and EVERY ERC20 or ERC721 on Ethereum or even bridged to Ethereum, the truth of Verus will be self-evident, and those who build on Verus will more easily build faster, better, more secure apps and services with the possibility of provable identity + privacy, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts all seamlessly integrated into UIs that do not need business deals, permission, or any centralized infrastructure to connect services and users, enabling everyone to communicate in provable, private, or public ways that always include bidirectional, secure commerce of all kinds.This core capabilities of this release include (lots to learn to understand it all, but here\u2019s a partial list):1) **Mainnet PBaaS Activation MAY 21, 2023, EXPECTED BLOCK #2546600**: v1.0.0 is MANDATORY, meaning that you will need to upgrade to this release or a later version v1.0.0-x, before MAY 21, 2023 to stay reliably connected to mainnet. Testnet will also be reset within the next day, and this release will allow you to connect to the new testnet, which we see as a core development platform and staging area for the Verus PBaaS network and have no plans to reset in any foreseeable future.",
