            "What is the current limitation when creating a PBaaS chain using the Verus Desktop, and how will this limitation change in the future?",
            "Currently, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop (e.g., BTC or ETH), you cannot use the same currency name for a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for the current testnet release. However, this limitation will be removed before the mainnet availability, allowing for more flexibility in naming PBaaS chains.",
            "2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.### DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
