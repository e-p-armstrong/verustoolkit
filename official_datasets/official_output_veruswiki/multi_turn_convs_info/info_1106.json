Some essential parameters include:\n\n* `name`: the name of the new currency\n* `options`: an integer that configures the currency's properties\n* `currencies`: an array of currencies that the new currency can be converted to\n* `conversions`: an array of conversion ratios between the new currency and each currency in the `currencies` array\n* `minpreconversion`: the minimum amount of the new currency required to launch\n* `preallocations`: an object that specifies the initial allocation of the new currency to specific VerusIDs",
