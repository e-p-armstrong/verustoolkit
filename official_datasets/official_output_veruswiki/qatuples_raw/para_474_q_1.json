    "How can I mint new coins in a currency that I've defined with `proofprotocol` set to 2?",
    "You can mint new coins in a currency with `proofprotocol` set to 2 using the `sendcurrency` command. The format of the command is as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=<chain_name> sendcurrency \"<currency_id>@\" '[{\"address\":\"<recipient_address>@\",\"currency\":\"<currency_name>\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":<amount_to_mint>]'\n```\nReplace `<chain_name>` with the name of the chain, `<currency_id>` with the ID of the currency, `<recipient_address>` with the address of the recipient, `<currency_name>` with the name of the currency, and `<amount_to_mint>` with the amount of coins to mint.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
