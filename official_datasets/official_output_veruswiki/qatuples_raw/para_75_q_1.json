Only do so when instructed by our support community members.\n\n## Deamons\n\nThe daemons are located in the `komodod`, `verusd` and `zcashd` folders that can be found in the\n`resources\\app\\assets\\bin\\win64\\` subfolder of your installation folder.\n\n## Program settings\n\nVerus Desktop saves it program settings on a different folder:\n`%AppData%\\Verus-Desktop`\nThe users settings are stored in `appdata\\config.json` in the program settings folder.\n\n## Standard chain data and wallet locations\n\n#### KMD\n\n`%AppData%\\Komodo`\n\n### Verus\n\n`%AppData%\\Komodo\\VRSC`\n\n#### Komodo asset chains\nAny Komodo asset chain will create a subfolder in the KMD chain data and wallet folder, which is standard named.
