    "How can I verify the authenticity of a downloaded Verus package?",
    "To verify the authenticity of a downloaded Verus package, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the signature. The `verifyfile` command takes the signer's identity, signature, and file path as arguments, while the `verifyhash` command takes the signer's identity, signature, and file hash as arguments.",
