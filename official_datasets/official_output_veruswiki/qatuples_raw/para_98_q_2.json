    "How can I send funds from a z-addr to a transparent address using Verus?",
    "You can send funds from a z-addr to a transparent address using the `z_sendmany` command. The format for this command is:\n\n`verus z_sendmany <YOUR zs-ADDRESS> '[{\"amount\":<AMOUNT>,\"address\":\"<RECIPIENT ADDRESS>\"}]'`\n\nReplace `<YOUR zs-ADDRESS>` with the private z-addr you want to send from, `<AMOUNT>` with the amount of Verus you want to send, and `<RECIPIENT ADDRESS>` with the transparent address or ID-name you want to send to.",
    "To just shield a single address, specify that as the first argument:\n\n`verus z_shieldcoinbase <YOUR R-ADDRESS> <YOUR zs-ADDRESS>`\n\nOnce the funds have moved to the zaddr and are confirmed, you can freely send them to any address, They will be eligble for staking id sent to a transpartent address (R-address).\n\nTo send from a certain zaddr to a transparent address, use z_sendmany. The following command sends 10 Verus to a given transparent address, ID address or ID-name.\nExample: `verus z_sendmany zcZpfuzzJqmNJ3fUJekvbnyuxuJe9eAURAHrMCvN2Nr7VuWjakb1LEw6j2etPcCnr45BRot7MaMbipuS5da162BfuUkFGxx '[{\"amount\":10,\"address\":\"Verus Coin Foundation@\"}]'`\n\nNote: revision date 2020-02-12.",
