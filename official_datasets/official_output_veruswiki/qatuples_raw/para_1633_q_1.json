    "What is required to use Sapling compatible, transparent mobile transactions on the Verus Coin or Zcash networks?",
    "To use Sapling compatible, transparent mobile transactions on the Verus Coin or Zcash networks, you need Verus Enhanced Agama v 0.4.0c.",
    "- All versions of the Verus Coin wallet from **0.4.0** and later have support for **Sapling high performance zero knowledge transactions**, which will activate on the Verus Coin Network at block **227520**. In addition to basic Sapling support, 0.4.0c includes support for Sapling compatible, transparent mobile transactions. **For lite mode usage on the Verus Coin or Zcash networks, you will need Verus Enhanced Agama v 0.4.0c.**- In addition to Sapling and support for Stake Guard transactions, which all versions **0.4.0** or later have, 0.4.0c also includes a powerful *\u201cCheat Catcher\u201d* that can earn money as miners and stakers who use it protect the Verus Coin network by catching stakers who are staking for rewards in a selfish way that does not contribute to converging the network on one blockchain. **The new \u201cCheat Catcher\u201d support requires a Sapling z-address, either passed in to the CLI wallet with the \u201c-cheatcatcher=zaddress\u201d option, or added in the Settings->App config of the enhanced Agama GUI.**",
