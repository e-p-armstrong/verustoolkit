    "What happened to the Verus testnet with the release of v0.7.2-2, and what should users do if they launched VRSCTEST from a previous version?",
    "The Verus testnet was deleted and relaunched on v0.7.2-2. If you have launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to v0.7.2-2, you should follow the instructions at the bottom of the release notes before running this update.",
    "Verus v0.7.2-2 is a mandatory for pools and notaries, but not generally mandatory Verus node and wallet upgrade, with support for the new Verus testnet (VRSCTEST) with fully decentralized finance, advanced ID capabilities, and DeFi liquidity system integrated into the new network protocol. While most of the changes in this release are focused on testnet, the mainnet support does include some improvements and a fix for the getblocktemplate API used by pools## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on v0.7.2-2. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO v0.7.2-2, PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RELEASE NOTES BEFORE RUNNING THIS UPDATE**## The New Verus DeFi Testnet\nThis is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever announced, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it\u2019s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel.
