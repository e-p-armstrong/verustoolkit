    "What are \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" warnings, and why do I see them when installing Verus?",
    "\"Not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" warnings are notifications from antivirus software that a program may be installed on your computer without your knowledge or consent, potentially allowing a third party to exploit your computer's resources. These warnings are not necessarily indicating that the software is malicious, but rather that it may be used for unintended purposes. In the case of Verus, these warnings are likely due to its mining capabilities, which can be exploited by third parties if not used properly.",
