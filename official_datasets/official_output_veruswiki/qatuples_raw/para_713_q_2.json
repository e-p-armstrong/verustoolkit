    "What are the implications of setting `proofprotocol` to PROOF_CHAINID when defining a new currency?",
    "Setting `proofprotocol` to PROOF_CHAINID gives the controller of the chain ID the authority to mint new coins, allowing them to control the supply of the currency. This can be useful for certain use cases, such as creating a centralized currency or token with a controlled supply.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
