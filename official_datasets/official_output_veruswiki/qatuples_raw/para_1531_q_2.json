    "What is the benefit of using a VerusID for receiving transactions?",
    "One of the benefits of using a VerusID for receiving transactions is that it allows you to easily upgrade to a quantum secure address in the future, which will retroactively secure all existing transactions sent to that address. This provides an additional layer of security and protection against potential quantum attacks.",
    "subject to its spend conditions as well. That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.",
