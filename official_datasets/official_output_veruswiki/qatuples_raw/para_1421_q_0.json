    "How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download using the command line?",
    "To verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands with the `verus` CLI. The `verifyfile` command takes the signer's identity, the signature, and the file path as arguments, while the `verifyhash` command takes the signer's identity, the signature, and the file hash as arguments. The result will be `true` if the signature is valid.\n\nFor example, to verify a file directly:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <file_path>\n```\nOr, to verify using a checksum:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <file_hash>\n```",
    "## Verifying Downloads\nA txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, is included for each download. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\".\n1) Extract downloaded archive\n2) Verify signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3) Extract archive to desired directory\n### CLI examples\n**Verifying file directly**\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AR1XEAABQR8XbEix6eohYN9m6BbLjcdUkCZH/NYw1/mfBq/mIT6SewPg4PvaJHsUIO8FLB8kQDpa9eKglWJN9DTfvpWlMH9Z /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.0-4-amd64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.0-4-amd64.tar.gz\n```\n**Verifying using a checksum**\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AR1XEAABQR8XbEix6eohYN9m6BbLjcdUkCZH/NYw1/mfBq/mIT6SewPg4PvaJHsUIO8FLB8kQDpa9eKglWJN9DTfvpWlMH9Z 3c8134361c965ab87751f817a097c1825ca61e2a521bfd1ed9382fbc44638920\n```**The result will be true if the signature is valid.**\n```\ntrue\n```At block 1053660, the Verus Mainnet Protocol upgraded to the new Komodo Notary Nodes for Komodo dPoW notarization, season 4, and a number of new capabilities, as well as a change to the Verus Proof of Power staking and mining hash that is now live on Verus mainnet.Although the network is running smoothly after the upgrade, an issue was identified and resolved in this release. In addition, a couple of user features, including restoring \"-pubkey=hexpubkey\" as a parameter for redirecting staking and mining rewards are included.## The network upgrade activated the following features:\n- Added support for season 4 Komodo notary node operators- Coinbase shielding will no longer be required on any coinbases from the past that have not yet been shielded.- Staking will now work on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds.",
