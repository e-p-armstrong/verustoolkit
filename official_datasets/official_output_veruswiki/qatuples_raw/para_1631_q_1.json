    "During an audit, a potential security issue was recently identified and fixed. This version both fixes the security issue in question immediately, and also uses this as an opportunity to include some early PBaaS functionality that while not fully enabled, will allow us to test future PBaaS functionality on the main Verus chain in the near future. There is no activation date for these fixes. They are important and immediate. There has been no exploitation of this issue yet, and to our knowledge, details are not known outside of core developers.
