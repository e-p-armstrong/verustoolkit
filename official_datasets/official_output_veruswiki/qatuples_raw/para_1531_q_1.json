    "How does Verus protect my transactions against potential quantum attacks?",
    "Verus is designed to be quantum-ready, which means that it has the ability to retroactively secure transactions sent to a VerusID once a quantum secure address is available. This ensures that even if a quantum computer is developed in the future, your transactions will still be secure.",
    "subject to its spend conditions as well. That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.",
