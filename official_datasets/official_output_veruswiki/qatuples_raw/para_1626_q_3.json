    "**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:**\n```\n./komodod -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\nOn first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
