    "What is a premine in the context of Verus chain definition?",
    "In the context of Verus chain definition, a premine refers to an initial allocation of coins to a specific address before the chain is launched. This allocation is defined in the chain definition and is typically used to reward early contributors or stakeholders.",
    "**Sample chain definition:**\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{\"name\":\"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\",\"premine\":50000000000000,\"initialcontribution\":5000000000000,\"conversion\":100000000,\"minpreconvert\":45000000000000,\"maxpreconvert\":100000000000000,\"launchfee\":0,\"billingperiod\":14400,\"notarizationreward\":100000000000,\"eras\":[{\"reward\":5000000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0,\"eraoptions\":1}],\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"ipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"},\n{\"networkaddress\":\"2ndipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"}]}'\n```The example above defines a chain that emits a premine to the indicated address and also converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.",
