    "What is the purpose of the \"startblock\" and \"endblock\" fields when defining a chain on Verus?",
    "The \"startblock\" field specifies the block height at which a VRSC block must be notarized into block 1 of a PBaaS chain. The \"endblock\" field specifies the block height at which the chain or currency is intended to end its life. If set to 0, the chain or currency will not have an end date.",
