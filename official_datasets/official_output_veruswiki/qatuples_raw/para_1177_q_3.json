    "How do I sign a transaction from a multisig ID, and what are the steps to broadcast it on the network?",
    "To sign a transaction from a multisig ID, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the transaction using `verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'`.\n2. Get the raw transaction data using `verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>`.\n3. Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs, and sign it using `verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>`.\n4. After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using `verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>`.\n\nThis process allows you to sign a transaction from a multisig ID, even if you don't have all the keys present in your wallet.",
    "While this release does include network robustness and a multisig fix, we were also able to upgrade Verus multisig capabilities to an ease of use and level of capability beyond other networks we are aware of today. In this release, it is now possible, on both mainnet and testnet, to issue any \u201csendcurrency\u201d command with the source being a multisig ID, for which you do not have all the keys present in your wallet. If you do, there will be a return error in operation status, from both GUI or CLI, and in that error will be the partially signed transaction, which can be used by applications or with copy and paste to send to other signers with partial authority over the source ID. On mainnet, destinations for such a transaction can include IDs, private addresses with memos to a z-address or ID:private, and transparent addresses. On testnet, such transactions can include all that is possible on mainnet as well as multiple currencies, currency conversions, and cross-chain sends.To our knowledge, this release raises the industry standard for multisig capability and its support on public blockchain protocols to a new level, even before considering the multisig revocation and recovery capabilities.## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)\nCreate transaction, get raw transaction data:\n  ```\n  verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n  verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n  ```\nTake the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:\n  ```\n  verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n  ```\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:\n  ```\n  verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n  ```",
