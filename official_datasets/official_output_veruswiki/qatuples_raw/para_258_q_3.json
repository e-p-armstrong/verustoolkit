    "How can I use JSON RPC to send multiple amounts to different addresses using Verus?",
    "You can use the `sendmany` method in a JSON RPC call to send multiple amounts to different addresses. The format is as follows:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"sendmany\", \"params\": [\"\", \"{\\\"address1\\\":amount1,\\\"address2\\\":amount2}\", confirmation, \"comment\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nReplace `myusername` with your actual username, `address1` and `address2` with the actual addresses you want to send to, `amount1` and `amount2` with the amounts you want to send, `confirmation` with the number of confirmations you want to wait for, and `comment` with the comment you want to add to the transaction.",
