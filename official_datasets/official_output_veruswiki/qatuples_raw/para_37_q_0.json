    "How can I optimize my mining setup to prioritize other system processes while still mining Verus?",
    "To optimize your mining setup, you can use the `nice` command to prioritize other system processes. Add `nice -n 19` before your mining command, for example:\n```\nnice -n 19./ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -t 6\n```\nThis will allow your system to prioritize other processes over mining.",
    "- Run your miner as you normally would, with `nice -n 19 ` placed in front of the command you normally use,\n  for example:\n   `nice -n 19 ./ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -t 6`\n - make sure you replace the pool (`stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999`) with your prefered pool and the address\n  (`RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ`) with your own address. The address shown in this line is the veruscoin\n  foundation donation address. If desired change the identifier (`Donator`) to a name that easily identifies the\n  miner to you.\n\nCreated by Oink.vrsc@.\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-11-11.",
