    "What happens when I connect to a chain for the first time?",
    "When you connect to a chain for the first time, a local config file is created. This means that you won't need to run VRSCTEST to connect to the chain again in the future. However, you will still need to run VRSCTEST to merge mine.",
    "**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:**\n```\n./komodod -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\nOn first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
