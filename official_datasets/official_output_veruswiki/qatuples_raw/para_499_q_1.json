    "What has been the significance of the testnet experience for the development of PBaaS?",
    "The testnet experience has been significant for the development of PBaaS, as it has allowed for the implementation of necessary changes and fixes, which have contributed to increased confidence in the technology. Additionally, it has led to the development of the Verus Oracle Notification technology, a fast, decentralized network response capability.",
    "### What\u2019s New for TestNet\nThis release includes an activation that allows a major upgrade to the testnet Ethereum bridge contracts that is both not expected to be needed again on testnet and not ever needed on mainnet with the new contract upgrade model. This upgrade should clear all known issues on the bridge to Goerli, meaning any remaining bridge transactions will be delivered, and the ETH bridge should then be fully functional.### The Path for PBaaS to Mainnet\nThis testnet has actually been through a lot already, more than we expected before mainnet, and this last experience, along with its full restoration of cross-chain and all function has been very useful and was the impetus for the Verus Oracle Notification technology. In the process of getting here, we implemented the necessary changes and fixes to get everything back on track, but we also have remnants of these events in the daemon, and on the final protocol, these are there to enable compatibility with the history of testnet, not because we need these upgrades on mainnet PBaaS. It gave us experience, increased confidence, and pushed us to develop a fast, decentralized network response capability. At the same time, it would be best for our code base, both on the Verus side and in the ETH contracts if that testnet history is removed from the code before mainnet activation. Doing so would make the next upgrade incompatible with today\u2019s testnet and its earlier history.As a result, we have decided that we will create one final testnet, but this time, we would do it a little differently than in the past. We will extend the pre-PBaaS upgrade on the existing testnet to a future date via the oracles. If you have started a chain and control the default oracle on any chain, please check the #pbaas-development channel for instructions on setting your oracle to extend the upgrade.",
