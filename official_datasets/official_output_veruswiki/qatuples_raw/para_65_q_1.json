    "How can I check if my Verus wallet is synchronized with the blockchain?",
    "You can check if your wallet is synchronized by comparing your wallet's block height with the current block height shown on the Verus explorer. If the numbers are equal or close, your wallet is likely synchronized. If the block height on the explorer is significantly higher (more than 10 blocks), your wallet may not be synchronized.",
    "# My wallet is stuck on block number XXXX. It does not synchronize properly anymore.note: Read it completely before use.### Verus `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata & `VRSC.conf` standard locations\n * Linux:\t\t`~/.komodo/VRSC`\n * Mac OS: \t`~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`\n * Windows 10: \t`%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`\n * OS independent through Verus Desktop: Click `help`, `Show Verus data folder (default)`#### Usefull links:\nLink 1: [Download latest Wallet](https://verus.io/wallet.html)\nLink 2: [Show current blockheight](https://explorer.verus.io/api/getblockcount)## Procedure:\nIn case your wallet is not synchronized with the blockchain and restarting doesn't connect to any peers:Compare your blockheight with the one Link 2 above is showing to make sure you are\nnot synchronized anymore. If the blockheight of the link above is significantly higher (more than 10) than\nthe blockheight your wallet is showing, follow the rest of the procedure.\nIf the numbers are equal or close, your wallet is synchronized and the procedure below will not solve any problems.Close your wallet.\nGo to the appropriate location for your OS as mentioned above.Add a similar list to the bottom of your `VRSC.conf`, just below `rpcallowip=127.0.0.1`:\n```\n addnode=157.90.113.198:27485\n addnode=95.217.1.76:27485\n```\nSave and exit the file.\nAn up-to-date list of working nodes can be found in Verus Discord in the #tipbot channel, by messaging `/peerinfo` in that channel.After you added nodes, remove `peers.dat` that is in the VRSC folder.\n(At least rename or move to a different location).\nMake sure you don't remove any other files/folders, or you'll have to [bootstrap](http://blacksquare/#!how-to/how-to_bootstrap.md) your wallet.\nThen start your wallet as you're used to.",
