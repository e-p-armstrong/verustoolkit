    "What is the significance of a transaction with no fee, sent from and to the same address, and the coinbase being sent to the same address in Verus?",
    "In Verus, a transaction with no fee, sent from and to the same address, and the coinbase being sent to the same address is an indication that a block was minted and a staking reward was received. This is a characteristic that can be used to easily confirm that a block was minted.",
    "# Question: How do you know a block was minted (staking reward)?\n\nYou can see the following characteristics:\n1. a block hash without a lot of leading zeros\n2. a last transaction that in your wallet has no fee, is from the same address that it is to, which is also the address the coinbase is to (easiest confirmation) and\n3. The POS difficulty is encoded in the low 32 bits of the nonce with 96 of the next nonce bits as zero/reserved, then a random hash at the top half\n\n(submitted by @keda666)",
