    "How can I determine when an immature block will mature (unlock) in Verus?",
    "To determine when an immature block will mature, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Get the current block height (\"blocks\") and the \"blockstomaturity\" value, which represents the distance to maturity of the transaction in question.\n2. Apply the formula: blockstomaturity / 1440 = days to maturity (unlocking).\n\nFor example, if blockstomaturity is 925558, you would calculate 925558 / 1440 = 643 days.",
    "# Question: How do I know when an immature block will \"unlock\" (mature)?\n\n## Procedure:\n1. Get the values of the current block height (\"blocks\") and the \"blockstomaturity\" the distance to maturity of the transaction in question. (i.e. the number of blocks between current block height and where it unlocks. You can see the number is decreasing all the time, and if you add it to the current block height you'll see a constant.)\n2. Apply this formula: blockstomaturity / 1440 = days to maturity (unlocking)\n  e.g. 925558/1440=643 days\n\n(submitted by @J Oliver Westbrook, edited by @elvinsophus )",
