    "What should I do if my Verus node is not synchronized with the rest of the network?",
    "If your Verus node is not synchronized with the rest of the network, you can try to identify the earliest block that is different from the rest of the network. To do this, use the `getblockhash` command to get the blockhash for a suspected block number, and compare it to the blockhash shown on the Verus explorer. Repeat this process until you find the earliest block that is different. Then, invalidate the incorrect block using the `invalidateblock` command, and reconsider the correct block using the `reconsiderblock` command.",
    "### CLI\n1. Search for the **earliest** block that not matches the blockchain:\n  `./verus getblockhash <suspected blocknumber>` will show you the blockhash for the blocknumber you filled in\n  The response will be similar to this:\n  `5cc7844973fb95ef17f1772ea4aba579f0d8273fb0ee6064cd8e707d1056c646`\n2. Check the blockhash your command gave you against the blockhash the [explorer](https://explorer.verus.io) shows.\n3. If the blockhash from the explorer is different than yours, repeat steps 1 & 2 until you find the earliest block that is different.\n4. Use the **earliest incorrect blockhash** from your system to invalidate that block:\n  `./verus invalidateblock <earliest incorrect blockhash>`\n  The deamon will not give feedback on this command.\n5. Now use the **correct blockhash** that the explorer gave you for the block you just locally invalidated:\n  `./verus reconsiderblock <correct blockhash>`\n  Again the daemon will not give feedback on this command.\n6. Once your daemon connects to a node that is on the correct chain, it will quicly synchronize.\n  If needed you can either restart your daemon to force new connections or manually disconnect bad nodes.\n\n(submitted by @jimboscott, Edited by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-11-11.",
