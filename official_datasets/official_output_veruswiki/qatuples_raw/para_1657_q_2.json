    "What should I do if my Verus wallet.dat, Chaindata, and VRSC.conf files are stored in a non-standard location, such as an external hard drive?",
    "If your Verus files are stored in a non-standard location, you may have a `datadir` specified in your VRSC.conf file. After updating Verus, navigate to the directory where your files are stored and check that the `datadir` is still correct. If it's not, edit the VRSC.conf file to append the correct `datadir` path.",
    "7. STOP the Verus daemon\n    ./verus stop\n  Check whether it has stopped running with this command. (To be doubly sure you can also look in the debug file in the )\n    top\n  (This time `verusd` should **NOT** appear in this list.)\n8. Rename the old versions of the binaries (replace the version numbers with the version being replaced)\n  (This ensures you can easily revert to the old version by renaming these files.)\n    mv verus verus-v0.7.3-9\n    mv verusd verusd-v0.7.2-9\n9. Check they have been renamed\n    ls-la\n10. Unpack/unzip the binaries for the latest version\n    tar -xvf Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tar.gz\n11. Check if they have unpacked/unzipped in the directory\n    ls -la\n12. If the directory where your Verus wallet.dat, Chaindata & VRSC.conf files are stored is in a non standard place - eg on a mounted external hard drive - you may have a datadir specified in your VRSC.conf file.\n  Navigate to that directory to check your datadir is still correct. The VRSC.conf file may have been overidden in the update. This ensures the Verus daemon knows where to find the blockchain you have currently saved on your system.\n    cat VRSC.conf\n  If it requires editing, use nano to edit this file\n    nano VRSC.conf\n  & append this to the VRSC.conf file :  \n    datadir=[your custom file path for your mounted hard drive]\n13. Start the Verus daemon again on the new version (add any other start options from https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-01_verusd_options.md)\n    ./verusd\n14. Check the version\n    ./ verus getwalletinfo\n15. Once you are satisfied the new version is working, clean up the older binares (from step 8) by deleting them (or just move them to another directory using the same mv command as step 8)\n    rm verus verus-v0.7.3-9\n    rm verus verusd-v0.7.3-9",
