    "What happens to existing transactions sent to my VerusID if I upgrade to a quantum secure address?",
    "When you upgrade to a quantum secure address, all existing transactions sent to your VerusID will be retroactively secured under the control of that address. This means that even if you have a large number of transactions (e.g. 1000) sent to your identity name/address, they will all be secured by the quantum secure address once it's available.",
    "subject to its spend conditions as well. That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.",
