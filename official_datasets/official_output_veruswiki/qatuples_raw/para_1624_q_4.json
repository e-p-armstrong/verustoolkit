    "How do I connect to a defined chain once it's created?",
    "To connect to a defined chain, you can use the following command:\n\n```\n./komodod -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\n\nThis will create a local config file, which allows you to connect to the chain without needing to run VRSCTEST. However, VRSCTEST is still needed to merge mine.",
    "Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". These are warnings that you are installing mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC.\nTo find out more about the false positives, review the following resources:\nhttps://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/\nhttps://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/\nPlease note that this is a test release intended to use with test chains. We do not advise using it for main net.\nDo not use as main wallet**Sample chain definition**:\n```\n./komodo-cli -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [{\"reward\" : 10000000000}], \"notarizationreward\" : 1440000000, \"billingperiod\" : 1440, \"nodes\" : [{\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2500\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"\"}, {\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2501\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"RDyDzC5JB66Y29fzBkamywqEn1PJXTzj8B\"}]}'\n```\nMaximum of 3 eras\nMinimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations.\nMinimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.\nVRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:**\n```\n./komodod -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\nOn first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.# Disclaimer",
