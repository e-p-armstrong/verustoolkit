    "How can I use the `sendcurrency` API to convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC, through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC?",
    "You can use the `sendcurrency` API to convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC, through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC, by running the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST to BTC through the fractional currency VRSC-BTC and sends it to the address `bob@`.",
    "The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.\n- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n  ```\n- **Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n  ```\n- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n  ```\n- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n  ```\n- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n  ```## Defining a CurrencyTo create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n",
