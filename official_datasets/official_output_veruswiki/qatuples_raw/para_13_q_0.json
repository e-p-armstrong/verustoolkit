    "How do I enter Verus CLI commands correctly on different operating systems?",
    "When entering Verus CLI commands, it's essential to format them correctly depending on your operating system. Here are some guidelines to follow:\n\n* On Linux and MacOS, enter the commands as shown in the CLI help, using single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`\"`) as indicated.\n* On Windows, using the native command prompt (`cmd.com`), substitute single quotes (`'`) with double quotes (`\"`), and double quotes (`\"`) with escaped double quotes (`\\\"`). Also, omit the preceding `./` from the command.\n\nFor example, the Linux command `./verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> '[{\"address\":\"<my_transparent_address>\",\"amount\":<95.9998>}]'` would become `verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> \"[{\\\"address\\\":\\\"<my_transparent_address>\\\",\\\"amount\\\":<95.9998>}]\"` on Windows.",
    "# Question: How do I unshield my coin rewards and get them staking on CLI?### Important General Information`verus command \"<userinput>\"` needs to be entered literally, with `<userinput>` replaced by your specific userdata. So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address,\nso it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`.#### Remarks on Windows command line formatting:The CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS. On the native windows command prompt (`cmd.com`) the formatting is different.\n* In windows command prompt, substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character.\n* In windows command prompt, substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters.\n* In windows command prompt, omit the preceding `./`.Note: As an example, in Linux the command:\n`./verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> '[{\"address\":\"<my_transparent_address>\",\"amount\":<95.9998>}]'`\nshould be entered on the Windows command prompt as:\n`verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> \"[{\\\"address\\\":\\\"<my_transparent_address>\\\",\\\"amount\\\":<95.9998>}]\"`",
