    "What is the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does it work?",
    "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain. It allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized and peer-to-peer manner, without the need for intermediaries. Users can pay or offer to pay from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, and accept payment to either type of address as well. The platform also allows owners to select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership.",
    "As always, we do not promise, we describe a vision and welcome contributors from everywhere. Now that we, as a community, have delivered on the original phases of the vision together, it is time for all of us to consider what we might want to build over this incredible, geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform. Our next efforts across the community should be to realize the promise of this network in the use cases we create, use cases that we will have an advantage creating on Verus over any other platform because it really is that much better.### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see.
