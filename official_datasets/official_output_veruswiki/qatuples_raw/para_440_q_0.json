    "What is the Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP), and how does it compare to other cross-chain protocols?",
    "The Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP) is a fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology that uses cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state. It is considered superior to and more decentralized than other cross-chain protocols, such as LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, and Thorchain.",
    "2) **Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP) - Layer 0 Multichain and Inter-chain Protocol**: To our knowledge, the VIP protocol is the only fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology available on any network that is based on cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state. From what we\u2019ve been able to learn about LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, Thorchain or others, VIP is different from (though closest in some ways to LayerZero), superior to, and more decentralized than all other cross-chain protocols we have seen. We can of course get into any level of discussion on the topic, but expect more descriptions and educational material to follow, now that the protocol was originally conceived of 5 years ago, and has been developed and tested/hardened for years.3) **VerusID Content Multimaps - Unlimited Provable Data for Every VerusID**: With the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs gain a powerful new capability that can be used for social networking, voting, oracles, publishing any information, various forms of provable attestations, ratings, and much, much more. With the scalability of PBaaS and VerusID content multimaps together, the Verus PBaaS network becomes the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world. We don\u2019t believe anything else even comes close, and with the recent rise of AI, it feels great to have this come together as a core original goal at a very appropriate and important time in history.",
