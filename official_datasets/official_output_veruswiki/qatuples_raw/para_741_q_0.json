    "What is the purpose of a locked VerusID, and how does it provide protection against unauthorized access?",
    "A locked VerusID provides an additional layer of security by introducing a delay between the time the ID is unlocked and when the funds can be accessed. This delay allows the revocation and recovery authority identities to detect and respond to unauthorized unlock attempts, effectively preventing theft or loss of funds. Even with a multisig of primary keys, the unlock delay must be waited out before funds can be accessed, giving the revocation and recovery authorities time to intervene if necessary.",
    "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
