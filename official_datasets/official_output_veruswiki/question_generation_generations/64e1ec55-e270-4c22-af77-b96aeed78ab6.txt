- content: "You are creating a logically-consistent series of questions about the\
    \ Verus multi-chain and multi-currency blockchain protocol. Given some text from\
    \ an informational website about Verus, the Verus coin, or other related Verus\
    \ community projects, you will create a comprehensive list of questions based\
    \ on the given information, and *only* based on the given information. The questions\
    \ will test comprehension of real information that would be worthy to teach in\
    \ order for people to understand more about the Verus protocol and community.\
    \ After each question, you will also write its answer.\n\nThe sequence of the\
    \ questions matters. They should build on each other. While questions should build\
    \ on each other, they still MUST make sense if read by themselves, without any\
    \ reference materials on hand.\n\nThe questions must ask about information that\
    \ a user of Verus might ask about. So they may ask about facts, explanations,\
    \ how to solve problems, or other things that may naturally come up; but more\
    \ \"educational test\"-type questions that are somewhat arbitrary, like \"what\
    \ is the error message that happens under these circumstances\" which a human\
    \ would never need to ask, that kind of stuff is banned.\n\n**Useful general background\
    \ information that comes up a lot:**\n\nVerus is an open-source, fairly launched,\
    \ decentralized blockchain protocol with proof-of-work and proof-of-stake as its\
    \ consensus mechanism. It offers rent-free blockchain tools for creators and organizations\
    \ to build products, services and systems.\n\nVerus is a multichain protocol with\
    \ strong focus on scalability, security and decentralization. It can scale to\
    \ world demand, is proven 51% hash attack resistant and is community built - all\
    \ coins in circulation are fairly mined and staked.\n\n* Any string resembling\
    \ \"Name@\" is likely a VerusID, which is essentially a crypto-address.\n* Verus\
    \ has been launched for a number of years by this point, and the mainnet and testnet\
    \ are both fully functional. Anything alluding to \"upcoming launches\" of features\
    \ could likely be out of date. So be ambiguous.\n\n**You Must:**\n\n* Create detailed\
    \ educational questions based on the snippet of a website.\n* Do not mention the\
    \ website, or the text, or any other reference. Just ask about the facts or information.\n\
    * Create as many or as few questions as are needed to adequately cover the material\
    \ in the snippet of the site.\n* Ensure a logical sequence of questions that build\
    \ on each other.\n* Keep in mind the timestamp of any solution. The current year\
    \ is: 2024.\n* Use markdown formatting (such as code blocks and snippets) in your\
    \ questions if applicable.\n* Focus on important information that is relevant\
    \ to understanding Verus. So you may ignore arbitrary metadata such as authors\
    \ or timestamps -- do not make those the subjects of questions.\n* Keep in mind\
    \ that the provided text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around this.\n* Include\
    \ the information from the given paragraph alongside a simpler explanation of\
    \ some underlying concepts, if possible.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* Documents may be out\
    \ of date, and technology described as being in development has likely been released\
    \ already. THEREFORE, BE AMBIGUOUS ABOUT RELEASES, using language like \"This\
    \ technology will do XYZ\" or by focusing on what the tech \"can\" do, rather\
    \ than what it \"does\" or \"will\" do.\n* You will always take a positive opinion\
    \ of Verus and try to promote it through the education.\n* Do NOT provide anchor\
    \ links to content in your answers; since the provided text to make questions\
    \ from is from a website, those links will be broken when used outside of said\
    \ website. So you should NEVER have any content like [some text](#!/some/path)\
    \ in your answer! External links are fine though.\n\nYou will create however many\
    \ questions make are needed to adequately cover the information in the paragraph.\n\
    \nDo not explicitly mention the provided text or the context in the questions\
    \ themselves \u2014 just ask about the concepts related to the questions.\n\n\
    If the text allows for an open-ended question, consider starting with an open-ended\
    \ question that gets at some broader information and helps teach high-level understanding,\
    \ before you start working your way down the paragraph making questions from the\
    \ top to the bottom. If the paragraph does not really allow for an open-ended\
    \ question, and is rather constrained (like a how-to) then consider just starting\
    \ with a \"normal\" question, from the perspective of a user of Verus, which asks\
    \ about information that's important to know."

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    \ functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation\
    \ involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs**\
    \ provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID**\
    \ provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus\
    \ network\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled\
    \ by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these\
    \ controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which\
    \ can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent\
    \ to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the\
    \ updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures\
    \ for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known\
    \ algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature\
    \ scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is\
    \ available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent\
    \ to it made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs can also be used to publish\
    \ ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem\
    \ has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n###\
    \ Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self\
    \ sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an\
    \ ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. VerusIDs are:\n\n* Revocable --\
    \ each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self.\
    \ If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke\
    \ the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block,\
    \ prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered,\
    \ effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft\
    \ or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable -- each ID also includes a\
    \ separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified\
    \ as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked\
    \ state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.\n\
    \n* Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which\
    \ can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains\
    \ a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications\
    \ and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively\
    \ provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong\
    \ identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\
    \n* Powerful - Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses,\
    \ and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity\
    \ (N of M). The revocation authority may only be altered by the revocation authority,\
    \ and the same applies to the recovery authority, either of which may be another\
    \ identity with its own N of M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\n----------------\nReminder\

  role: user
- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. Being more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve\
    \ corporations in the protocol, and provide benefits such as (but not limited\
    \ to): revocability, recoverability, privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto addresses on the Verus worldwide network.\n\nThey are a form\
    \ of crypto-address, a unique identifier that serves as a destination for sending\
    \ and receiving digital assets. \n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready friendly\
    \ crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    The phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context of Verus\
    \ and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum\
    \ computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure signature\
    \ scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have all the\
    \ funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may also\
    \ be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    VerusIDs can be created by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority,\
    \ and give their creator complete, self-sovereign control over their ID. The costs\
    \ incurred creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially,\
    \ the community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity\
    \ like a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nHow can I park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token\
    \ (like GOLD) before that token launches, using the command line?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    To park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before the token launches, you\
    \ can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```\n./verus\
    \ -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"convertto\"\
    :\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis will effectively park\
    \ your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After the launch, you will either\
    \ find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original\
    \ VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow can I create a new token called\
    \ \"mycoin\" using the command line, which can be converted to with either GOLD\
    \ or VRSCTEST? Assume that GOLD is a new token that just launched.\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    In order to create a new token called \"mycoin\" using the command line, you must\
    \ run a command to define the currency's properties. Here's an example of such\
    \ a command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\"\
    ,\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"\
    minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\n\nThis command\
    \ defines a new token named \"mycoin\". Some important notes about this configuration:\n\
    \n1. `proofprotocol` being set to 2 means that it's set to PROOF_CHAINID. This\
    \ means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.\n2. `options`\
    \ is a configurable integer, in this case set to 33.\n3. `currencies` lists which\
    \ tokens can be converted to mycoin.\n4. `\"minpreconversion\": [10000,5.1298]`\
    \ defines the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin,\
    \ respectively.\n5. `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of mycoin to 20,000\
    \ units.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does it mean if `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when\
    \ defining a new token?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nWhen `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when\
    \ defining a new token, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID,\
    \ which means that the controller of the chain ID may mint new tokens. This can\
    \ be done with a command like the following example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST\
    \ sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"\
    mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow can I define a PBaaS\
    \ blockchain using Verus?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nYou can define a PBaaS blockchain using\
    \ a single command line command with Verus. You need to pass two JSON objects,\
    \ one for the PBaaS blockchain, and another for the overridable defaults of the\
    \ bridge. Here's an example of how to define a PBaaS blockchain:\n\n```shell\n\
    ./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"options\":264,\"\
    currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\"],\"conversions\":[1],\"eras\":[{\"reward\":1200000000,\"\
    decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0}],\"notaries\":[\"Notary1@\",\"Notary2@\"\
    ,\"Notary3@\"],\"minnotariesconfirm\":2,\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.111:10000\"\
    ,\"nodeidentity\":\"Node1@\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.112:10000\",\"\
    nodeidentity\":\"Node2@\"}],\"gatewayconvertername\":\"Bridge\",\"gatewayconverterissuance\"\
    :1000000}' '{\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\",\"PBaaSChain\",\"USD\"],\"initialcontributions\"\
    :[371747.20398827,0,1000000],\"initialsupply\":3000000}'\n```\n\nNote the following\
    \ important information used when defining the PBaaS blockchain:\n\n1. The \"\
    name\" field defines the name of the chain.\n2. The \"options\" property is an\
    \ integer, in this case it's set to 264.\n2. You can define an array of currencies\
    \ that the chain's native currency can be converted into using the \"currencies\"\
    \ property.\n3. You may define the conversion ratios between the chain's native\
    \ currency, and each currency on the chain, using the \"conversions\" property.\n\
    4. The \"eras\" property defines the block reward, reward decay, halving, and\
    \ end of each \"era\" in the chain's lifecycle\n5. \"notaries\" is a list of the\
    \ VerusIDs that will serve as notaries on the chain.\n6. \"minnotariesconfirm\"\
    \ is an integer for the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block.\n\
    7. The \"nodes\" property is an array describing the network addresses of the\
    \ nodes on the chain, as well as their IDs.\n\nNote that the bridge definition\
    \ default overrides are a separate string from the currency definition properties.\
    \ The bridge can be used to move funds on and off the PBaaS chain. The bridge's\
    \ JSON object has some of its own properties:\n1. `currencies` defines the currency\
    \ tickers that the bridge supports (including the native coins of the chains being\
    \ bridged).\n2. `initialcontributions` specifies the initial liquidity for each\
    \ currency in the bridge.\n3. `initialsupply` gives the initial supply for the\
    \ bridge's native token.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow can I export an ID to a PBaaS chain\
    \ using the command line and Verus?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nYou can accomplish this with\
    \ a single command on the command line \u2014 the sendcurrency command. Here's\
    \ an example, where the ID \"IDNAME@\" is exported to \"PBaaSChainName.\"\n\n\
    ```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\"\
    :\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"\
    }]'\n```\n\nSome parts of this command you should be aware of:\n1. The `sendcurrency`\
    \ command takes two arguments when exporting an ID: a string `\"*\"` and another\
    \ string containing the options.\n2. `address` is the ID being exported.\n3. `exportto`\

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    What does the `definechain` command do in Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    The `definechain` command in Verus is used to define a new chain with specific
    properties, such as its name, payment address, premine amount, conversion ratio,
    and node configuration. This command allows users to create a custom chain with
    tailored settings.


    **QUESTION:**

    What is the purpose of the "premine" property in a chain definition?


    **ANSWER:**

    The "premine" property in a chain definition specifies the amount of currency
    that will be emitted to the indicated address at the launch of the chain. This
    is often used to provide an initial supply of currency for the chain.


    **QUESTION:**

    How does the "conversion" property in a chain definition work?


    **ANSWER:**

    The "conversion" property in a chain definition specifies the conversion rate
    at which contributions will be converted to the native chain currency at launch.
    In the example provided, the conversion rate is 100%, meaning that all contributions
    will be converted to the native currency at a 1:1 ratio.


    **QUESTION:**

    What happens if the minimum contributions are not met when defining a new chain?


    **ANSWER:**

    If the minimum contributions are not met when defining a new chain, the chain
    will fail to start, and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.
    This ensures that the chain only launches if it has sufficient support and funding.


    **QUESTION:**

    What is the purpose of the "nodes" property in a chain definition?


    **ANSWER:**

    The "nodes" property in a chain definition specifies the configuration of the
    nodes that will make up the chain. This includes their network addresses and payment
    addresses. These nodes will be responsible for validating transactions and maintaining
    the integrity of the chain.'
