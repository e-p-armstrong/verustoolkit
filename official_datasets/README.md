NOTE: These datasets were generated using Meta's Llama 3 70b Instruct model. While the project is MIT licensed, these datasets, as outputs of that model, may not (per the license of Llama 3) be used to improve LLMs other than derivatives of Llama 3. If you wish to (legally) finetune a model that is not Llama 3, you will have to use a different architecture of model to generate the datasets.

The datasets included are simply each of the folders in `text_inputs`, generated with each of the prompt overrides as well as the default. The names should be descriptive enough to recreate the settings used.
