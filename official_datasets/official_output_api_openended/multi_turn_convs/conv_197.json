    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how to interact with the Verus network. Could you explain the purpose of the `submitblock` command in Verus, and how I can use it to submit a new block to the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `submitblock` command in Verus is a crucial tool for interacting with the network. It's used to attempt to submit a new block to the network. This command takes two arguments: `hexdata` and `jsonparametersobject`.\n\nLet me break it down for you. `hexdata` is a required string parameter that represents the hex-encoded block data to be submitted. On the other hand, `jsonparametersobject` is an optional string parameter that contains an object of optional parameters. Currently, the only optional parameter is `workid`, which is a string that must be included with submissions if the server provided a workid.\n\nWhen you use the `submitblock` command, the node will attempt to validate the block and add it to the network. The command returns a result that indicates the status of the block submission. You might see one of the following results:\n\n* \"duplicate\" - the node already has a valid copy of the block\n* \"duplicate-invalid\" - the node already has the block, but it is invalid\n* \"duplicate-inconclusive\" - the node already has the block, but has not validated it\n* \"inconclusive\" - the node has not validated the block, and it may not be on the node's current best chain\n* \"rejected\" - the block was rejected as invalid\n\nYou can use the `submitblock` command in two ways: through the Verus command-line interface or by making an HTTP request using a tool like `curl`. The examples provided in the documentation demonstrate both methods.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the `submitblock` command or how to use it to submit a new block to the network?",
