    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the `fundrawtransaction` command in Verus. Can you explain its purpose and how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `fundrawtransaction` command is a crucial tool in Verus that helps you create and manage transactions. I'd be happy to explain its purpose and step-by-step process.\n\nThe `fundrawtransaction` command in Verus is used to add inputs to a transaction until it has enough value to meet its output value. This command takes four arguments: a hex string of the raw transaction, an optional UTXO list to select from for funding, an optional address to send change to if there is any, and an optional explicit fee to offer instead of the default fee.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how `fundrawtransaction` works:\n\n1. **Initial Transaction**: You start with a raw transaction that has no inputs or not enough inputs to meet its output value. You can create such a transaction using the `createrawtransaction` command.\n2. **Add Inputs**: The `fundrawtransaction` command adds unsigned inputs to the transaction until it has enough value to meet its output value. It will not modify existing inputs and will add one change output to the outputs.\n3. **Change Output**: If there is any change left over after adding inputs, it will be sent to the address specified in the `changeaddress` argument.\n4. **Fee**: The command will add a fee to the transaction, which can be specified explicitly using the `explicitfee` argument.\n5. **Result**: The command returns a JSON object with three properties: `hex`, `fee`, and `changepos`. The `hex` property contains the resulting raw transaction as a hex-encoded string, the `fee` property contains the fee added to the transaction, and the `changepos` property contains the position of the added change output, or -1 if no change output was added.\n6. **Signing and Sending**: After funding the transaction, you need to sign it using the `signrawtransaction` command and then send it using the `sendrawtransaction` command.\n\nIn summary, the `fundrawtransaction` command is a critical step in the process of creating and sending a transaction in Verus. It helps to add sufficient inputs to a transaction to meet its output value and ensures that the transaction is properly funded and ready for signing and sending.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the `fundrawtransaction` command or the process of creating and sending transactions in Verus?",
