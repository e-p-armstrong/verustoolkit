    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there! I'm trying to figure out how to get a list of all banned IPs and subnets in Verus. Can you help me with that? And are there different ways to do so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that. In Verus, you can retrieve a list of all banned IPs and subnets using the `listbanned` command. This command is useful for checking which IPs or subnets have been banned from accessing the Verus network.\n\nThere are two ways to use the `listbanned` command:\n\n**Method 1: Using the Verus Command Line Interface (CLI)**\nYou can use the Verus CLI to run the `listbanned` command directly. To do so, open a terminal and type:\n```\nverus listbanned\n```\nThis will display a list of all banned IPs and subnets.\n\n**Method 2: Using the JSON-RPC API**\nAlternatively, you can use the Verus JSON-RPC API to retrieve the list of banned IPs and subnets. To do so, you can use a tool like `curl` to send a JSON-RPC request to the Verus server. Here's an example:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"listbanned\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nReplace `myusername` with your actual username, and `http://127.0.0.1:27486/` with the URL and port of your Verus server.\n\nIn both cases, the `listbanned` command will return a list of all banned IPs and subnets, which can be useful for troubleshooting connection issues or identifying potential security threats.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `listbanned` command or managing banned IPs and subnets in Verus?",
