    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to get more information about specific blocks and their transactions on the Verus network, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you tell me what the `getblockdeltas` command is, and how I can enable it to return information about a specific block and its transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblockdeltas` command is a powerful feature in Verus that allows users to retrieve information about a specific block and its transactions. This command takes a single argument, which is the hash of the block for which you want to retrieve information.\n\nHowever, by default, the `getblockdeltas` command is disabled for security reasons. To enable it, you need to configure your Verus node to allow experimental features and insight explorer. There are two ways to do this:\n\n1. **Command-line options:** When starting your Verus node, you can use the following command-line options: `-experimentalfeatures` and `-insightexplorer`. This will enable the `getblockdeltas` command for the current session.\n2. **zcash.conf file:** Alternatively, you can add the following lines to your `zcash.conf` file: `experimentalfeatures=1` and `insightexplorer=1`. This will enable the `getblockdeltas` command permanently.\n\nOnce you have enabled the `getblockdeltas` command, you can use it to retrieve information about a specific block and its transactions. The command takes a single argument, which is the hash of the block for which you want to retrieve information. For example:\n```\ngetblockdeltas \"blockhash\"\n```\nReplace `blockhash` with the actual hash of the block you're interested in. The `getblockdeltas` command will then return detailed information about the block and its transactions.\n\nHave you tried enabling the `getblockdeltas` command using one of these methods? Do you have any further questions about how to use it or what kind of information it returns?",
