    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with the `getnotarizationproofs` command in Verus. Can you explain how to use it and what are the different ways to access this functionality?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getnotarizationproofs` command in Verus is used to retrieve notarization proofs, which are essential for verifying the integrity of transactions and blocks on the Verus network. There are two ways to access this functionality: through the command line using the `verus` executable, and through a JSON-RPC interface using the `curl` command.\n\nLet's break down both methods:\n\n**Using the Command Line:**\nTo use the `getnotarizationproofs` command through the command line, you can execute the following command:\n```\nverus getnotarizationproofs '[{\"type\":\"iCwxpRL6h3YeCRtGjgQSsqoKdZCuM4Dxaf\", \"evidence\":{CNotaryEvidence}, \"proveheight\":n, \"atheight\":n},...]'\n```\nHere, you need to replace the placeholders with the actual values:\n* `type`: the type of notarization proof you want to retrieve\n* `evidence`: the evidence data for the notarization proof\n* `proveheight`: the height at which the notarization proof is proved\n* `atheight`: the height at which the notarization proof is requested\n\n**Using JSON-RPC:**\nAlternatively, you can access the `getnotarizationproofs` functionality through a JSON-RPC interface using the `curl` command:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getnotarizationproofs\", \"params\": [[{\"type\":\"iCwxpRL6h3YeCRtGjgQSsqoKdZCuM4Dxaf\", \"evidence\":{CNotaryEvidence}, \"proveheight\":n, \"atheight\":n},...]] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nHere, you need to replace the placeholders with the actual values:\n* `myusername`: your username for authentication\n* `type`, `evidence`, `proveheight`, and `atheight`: the same as above\n\nIn both cases, the `getnotarizationproofs` command will return the requested notarization proofs, which can be used to verify the integrity of transactions and blocks on the Verus network.\n\nDo you have any further questions about using the `getnotarizationproofs` command, or would you like more information on notarization proofs in general?",
