    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the `rescanfromheight` command in Verus. Can you explain its purpose and how to use it to rescan the current wallet from a specified height?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `rescanfromheight` command in Verus is a powerful tool that's used to rescan the current wallet from a specified height. This command is useful when you need to synchronize your wallet with the blockchain from a specific point in time.\n\nThe command takes one optional argument, `height`, which specifies the block height from which to start the rescan. If you don't provide a height, the command will default to 0, which means it will rescan the entire blockchain from the beginning.\n\nTo use the `rescanfromheight` command, you can simply type `verus rescanfromheight` in your terminal to initiate a rescan of the entire chain. If you want to rescan from a specific block height, you can specify the height as an argument, for example, `verus rescanfromheight 1000000` to rescan from block 1000000.\n\nJust a heads up, this command can take a significant amount of time to complete, especially for very large wallets or rescans. This is because the command needs to re-download and re-process all transactions from the specified height to the current block height, which can be a resource-intensive operation.\n\nIn summary, the `rescanfromheight` command is a useful tool in Verus that allows you to resynchronize your wallet with the blockchain from a specific point in time. It can be used to recover from wallet corruption, to re-download missing transactions, or to simply ensure that your wallet is up-to-date with the latest blockchain state.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the `rescanfromheight` command or its usage?",
