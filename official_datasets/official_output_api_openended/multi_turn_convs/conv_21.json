    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to manage my wallet and I'm having trouble keeping track of my balances. Is there a command in Verus that can help me with this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is a command that can help you with that! The `listreceivedbyaddress` command in Verus is used to list the balances of all receiving addresses in your Verus wallet. This command is useful for tracking the balances of different addresses and accounts in your wallet.\n\nThe command takes three optional arguments:\n\n1. `minconf`: This specifies the minimum number of confirmations required before a payment is included in the balance. The default value is 1.\n2. `includeempty`: This is a boolean value that determines whether to include addresses that haven't received any payments in the balance list. The default value is false.\n3. `includeWatchonly`: This is a boolean value that determines whether to include watch-only addresses in the balance list. Watch-only addresses are addresses that have been imported into your wallet but are not controlled by your wallet. The default value is false.\n\nThe `listreceivedbyaddress` command returns a list of objects, each representing a receiving address and its corresponding balance. The objects contain the following properties:\n\n1. `involvesWatchonly`: A boolean value indicating whether the address is a watch-only address.\n2. `address`: The receiving address.\n3. `account`: The account associated with the receiving address (deprecated).\n4. `amount`: The total amount of VRSC received by the address.\n5. `confirmations`: The number of confirmations of the most recent transaction included in the balance.\n\nYou can use the `listreceivedbyaddress` command in various ways, such as:\n\n* `verus listreceivedbyaddress`: This lists the balances of all receiving addresses with at least one confirmation.\n* `verus listreceivedbyaddress 6 true`: This lists the balances of all receiving addresses with at least 6 confirmations, including empty addresses.\n* `verus listreceivedbyaddress 6 true true`: This lists the balances of all receiving addresses with at least 6 confirmations, including empty addresses and watch-only addresses.\n\nYou can also use the `curl` command to access the Verus RPC API and execute the `listreceivedbyaddress` command remotely.\n\nDoes that help? Do you have any more questions about using the `listreceivedbyaddress` command?",
