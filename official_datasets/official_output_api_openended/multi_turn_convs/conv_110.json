    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get a better understanding of shielded transactions in my wallet. Can you tell me what information I can get about a shielded transaction using the `z_viewtransaction` command, and what do the different parts of the result mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_viewtransaction` command is a powerful tool for exploring shielded transactions in your wallet. When you run the command with a transaction ID (txid), it returns a JSON object containing detailed information about the transaction. Let me break down the different parts of the result for you.\n\nThe result will contain several key-value pairs, including:\n\n* `txid`: This is the transaction ID, which is a string.\n* `spends`: This is an array of objects, each representing a spend in the transaction. Each object will contain:\n\t+ `type`: This indicates the type of address involved in the spend, either \"sprout\" or \"sapling\".\n\t+ `js` and `jsSpend`: These are indices of the JSDescription and spend within the JSDescription, respectively, for sprout addresses.\n\t+ `spend`: This is the index of the spend within the vShieldedSpend for sapling addresses.\n\t+ `txidPrev`: This is the transaction ID of the transaction that created the note being spent.\n\t+ `jsPrev` and `jsOutputPrev`: These are indices of the JSDescription and output within the JSDescription, respectively, for sprout addresses.\n\t+ `outputPrev`: This is the index of the output within the vShieldedOutput for sapling addresses.\n\t+ `address`: This is the z-address involved in the transaction.\n\t+ `value`: This is the amount of VRSC involved in the transaction.\n\t+ `valueZat`: This is the amount in zatoshis (a smaller unit of VRSC).\n* `outputs`: This is an array of objects, each representing an output in the transaction. Each object will contain:\n\t+ `type`: This indicates the type of address involved in the output, either \"sprout\" or \"sapling\".\n\t+ `js` and `jsOutput`: These are indices of the JSDescription and output within the JSDescription, respectively, for sprout addresses.\n\t+ `output`: This is the index of the output within the vShieldedOutput for sapling addresses.\n\t+ `address`: This is the Verus private address involved in the transaction.\n\t+ `recovered`: This is a boolean indicating whether the output is not for an address in the wallet (only applicable for sapling addresses).\n\nBy using `z_viewtransaction`, you can gain a better understanding of the details of a shielded transaction in your wallet. Do you have any more questions about this command or the information it provides?",
