    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how to retrieve the result and status of an operation in Verus. What is the purpose of the `z_getoperationresult` command, and how do you use it to achieve this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getoperationresult` command in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to retrieve the result and status of an operation that has finished, and then remove the operation from memory. This command takes an optional argument, which is a list of operation IDs that you are interested in. If no operation IDs are provided, the command will examine all operations known to the node.\n\nThe result of the command is a list of JSON objects, each containing information about the operation, such as its result and status.\n\nTo use the `z_getoperationresult` command, you can use the Verus command-line interface or make a JSON-RPC request to the Verus node. Here are some examples of how to use the command:\n\nUsing the Verus command-line interface:\n```\nverus z_getoperationresult '[\"operationid\",... ]'\n```\nMaking a JSON-RPC request to the Verus node:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_getoperationresult\", \"params\": ['[\"operationid\",... ]'] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nIn both cases, you need to replace `\"operationid\"` with the actual ID of the operation you want to retrieve the result for. If you want to retrieve the results for multiple operations, you can provide a list of operation IDs.\n\nBy using the `z_getoperationresult` command, you can programmatically retrieve the results of operations that have finished, and then remove them from memory to free up resources. This can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as when you need to automate the processing of operations or when you want to build a custom application on top of Verus.\n\nDo you have any other questions about using the `z_getoperationresult` command, or would you like more information on how to integrate it into your workflow?",
