    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand how to manage IP/Subnet bans in Verus. Can you explain how to add and remove them from the banned list, and how to specify the duration of the ban?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nManaging IP/Subnet bans in Verus is a crucial task for maintaining the security and integrity of your network. You can do this using the `setban` command. This command allows you to add or remove a specific IP/Subnet from the banned list, and also specify the duration of the ban.\n\nThe `setban` command takes four arguments: the IP/Subnet, the command (either \"add\" or \"remove\"), the ban time, and an optional absolute timestamp.\n\nThe IP/Subnet argument is a string that specifies the IP address or Subnet you want to ban. You can specify a netmask along with the IP address to ban a range of IP addresses. If you don't specify a netmask, it defaults to /32, which means a single IP address.\n\nThe command argument is a string that specifies whether you want to add or remove the IP/Subnet from the banned list. You can use either \"add\" to ban the IP/Subnet or \"remove\" to unban it.\n\nThe ban time argument is an optional numeric value that specifies how long the IP/Subnet should be banned. If you don't specify a ban time, it defaults to 24 hours. You can also specify an absolute timestamp in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, GMT) by setting the absolute argument to true.\n\nHere are some examples of using the `setban` command:\n\n* To ban a single IP address for 24 hours, you can use the command `verus setban \"192.168.0.6\" \"add\" 86400`.\n* To ban a range of IP addresses (in this case, the entire 192.168.0.0/24 subnet), you can use the command `verus setban \"192.168.0.0/24\" \"add\"`.\n* You can also use the `setban` command with the JSON-RPC API, as shown in the example `curl` command.\n\nDo you have any further questions about managing IP/Subnet bans in Verus, or would you like some more examples of using the `setban` command?",
