    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to figure out how to send VRSC from one account to another using the Verus CLI. Can you explain how the `sendfrom` command works, and what are its arguments and optional parameters?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendfrom` command in Verus is used to send a specific amount of VRSC from a designated account to a VRSC address. Although it is deprecated and has been replaced by `sendtoaddress`, it is still important to understand how it works.\n\nThe `sendfrom` command takes six arguments. Let me break them down for you:\n\n1. **\"fromaccount\"**: This is a required string argument that specifies the account from which the funds will be sent. If you want to use the default account, you must set this argument to an empty string (`\"\"`).\n2. **\"toVRSCaddress\"**: This is a required string argument that specifies the VRSC address to which the funds will be sent.\n3. **amount**: This is a required numeric argument that specifies the amount of VRSC to be sent. Note that the transaction fee is added on top of this amount.\n4. **minconf**: This is an optional numeric argument that specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for the funds to be used. If not specified, it defaults to 1.\n5. **\"comment\"**: This is an optional string argument that allows you to add a comment to the transaction, which is stored in your wallet but not part of the transaction itself.\n6. **\"comment-to\"**: This is an optional string argument that allows you to add a comment to specify the name of the person or organization to which you're sending the transaction, which is stored in your wallet but not part of the transaction itself.\n\nWhen you run the `sendfrom` command, it returns a string result, which is the transaction ID.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `sendfrom` command:\n\n* Send 0.01 VRSC from the default account to a specific address, with a minimum of 1 confirmation:\n```\nverus sendfrom \"\" \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 0.01\n```\n* Send 0.01 VRSC from the \"tabby\" account to a specific address, with a minimum of 6 confirmations, and add comments:\n```\nverus sendfrom \"tabby\" \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 0.01 6 \"donation\" \"seans outpost\"\n```\nYou can also use the `sendfrom` command as a JSON RPC call, as shown in the example:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"sendfrom\", \"params\": [\"tabby\", \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\", 0.01, 6, \"donation\", \"seans outpost\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nIt's important to note that the `sendfrom` command is deprecated and should be replaced with `sendtoaddress` in your code.\n\nDo you have any questions about using the `sendfrom` command, or would you like more information on how to use `sendtoaddress` instead?",
