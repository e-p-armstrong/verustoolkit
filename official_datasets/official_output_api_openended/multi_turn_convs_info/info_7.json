            "How do I list transactions in Verus, and what are the different ways to do so?",
            "In Verus, you can list transactions using the `listtransactions` command. This command allows you to view a list of transactions that have taken place on the Verus network. There are several ways to use this command, depending on the specific information you want to retrieve.\n\n**Listing the Most Recent Transactions:**\nTo list the most recent 10 transactions in the system, you can simply run the command `verus listtransactions`. This will return a list of the 10 most recent transactions that have taken place on the network.\n\n**Listing Specific Transactions:**\nIf you want to list a specific range of transactions, you can do so by specifying the range in the command. For example, to list transactions 100 to 120, you would run the command `verus listtransactions \"*\" 20 100`. This will return a list of transactions 100 to 120, inclusive.\n\n**Using JSON RPC:**\nYou can also use JSON RPC (Remote Procedure Call) to list transactions. To do so, you would use a command like `curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"listtransactions\", \"params\": [\"*\", 20, 100] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`. This command sends a JSON RPC request to the Verus daemon, which will then return a list of transactions 100 to 120.\n\nIn general, the `listtransactions` command is a useful tool for viewing and tracking transactions on the Verus network. By using the different options and parameters available, you can customize the command to retrieve the specific information you need.",
