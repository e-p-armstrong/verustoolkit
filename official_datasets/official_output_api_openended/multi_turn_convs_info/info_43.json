            "The `getreceivedbyaccount` command in Verus is used to retrieve the total amount of VRSC received by a specific account. This command is deprecated, which means it is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions of Verus.\n\nThe command takes two arguments:\n\n1. \"account\" (string, required): This must be set to an empty string (`\"\"`)) to represent the default account. Passing any other string will result in an error.\n2. minconf (numeric, optional, default=1): This specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for transactions to be included in the calculation.\n\nThe result of the command is the total amount of VRSC received by the specified account, with the specified minimum number of confirmations.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `getreceivedbyaccount` command:\n\n* To get the amount received by the default account with at least 1 confirmation: `verus getreceivedbyaccount \"\"`\n* To get the amount received by the \"tabby\" account, including unconfirmed amounts with zero confirmations: `verus getreceivedbyaccount \"tabby\" 0`\n* To get the amount received by the \"tabby\" account with at least 6 confirmations: `verus getreceivedbyaccount \"tabby\" 6`\n\nThe command can also be used as a JSON RPC call, as shown in the example:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getreceivedbyaccount\", \"params\": [\"tabby\", 6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nNote that the `getreceivedbyaccount` command is deprecated and may be removed in future versions of Verus. It is recommended to use alternative commands or methods to achieve the same result.",
