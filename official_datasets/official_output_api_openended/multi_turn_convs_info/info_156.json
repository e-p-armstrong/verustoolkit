            "How can I view all open offers in my wallet using the `listopenoffers` command, and what are the optional arguments I can use to filter the results?",
            "The `listopenoffers` command is a useful tool for viewing all open offers in your wallet. This command allows you to see all outstanding offers in your wallet, which can be helpful for managing your transactions and keeping track of your offers.\n\nWhen you use the `listopenoffers` command, you can optionally specify two arguments: `unexpired` and `expired`. These arguments allow you to filter the results to show only open offers that are either still valid (unexpired) or have already expired.\n\nBy default, the `unexpired` argument is set to `true`, which means that the command will show all open offers in your wallet that have not yet expired. Similarly, the `expired` argument is also set to `true` by default, which means that the command will also show all open offers in your wallet that have already expired.\n\nIf you want to see only open offers that are still valid, you can set the `expired` argument to `false`. Conversely, if you want to see only open offers that have already expired, you can set the `unexpired` argument to `false`.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use the `listopenoffers` command:\n```\nlistopenoffers unexpired=true expired=false\n```\nThis command would show only the open offers in your wallet that are still valid and have not yet expired.\n\nOverall, the `listopenoffers` command is a useful tool for managing your offers and transactions in Verus. By using the optional `unexpired` and `expired` arguments, you can customize the results to show only the open offers that are relevant to your needs.",
