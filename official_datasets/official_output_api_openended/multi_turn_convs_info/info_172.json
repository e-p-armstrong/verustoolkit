            "What is the purpose of the `listaccounts` command in Verus, and how can it be used to retrieve account balances with different confirmation requirements?",
            "The `listaccounts` command in Verus is used to retrieve a list of account balances. This command is deprecated, but it still allows you to get a summary of the balances of all your accounts. The command returns a JSON object where the keys are the account names and the values are the total balances for each account.\n\nYou can customize the output of the `listaccounts` command by specifying two optional arguments: `minconf` and `includeWatchonly`. The `minconf` argument allows you to set a minimum number of confirmations required for a transaction to be included in the balance calculation. For example, if you set `minconf` to 6, only transactions with at least 6 confirmations will be included in the balance calculation.\n\nThe `includeWatchonly` argument is a boolean value that determines whether to include balances in watchonly addresses. Watchonly addresses are addresses that are not spendable by the wallet, but are still monitored by the wallet.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `listaccounts` command:\n\n* To list account balances with at least 1 confirmation, you can simply use the command `verus listaccounts`.\n* To list account balances including zero confirmation transactions, you can use the command `verus listaccounts 0`.\n* To list account balances for 6 or more confirmations, you can use the command `verus listaccounts 6`.\n\nYou can also use the `listaccounts` command as a JSON RPC call. For example:\n```bash\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"listaccounts\", \"params\": [6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nThis will retrieve the account balances with at least 6 confirmations using a JSON RPC call.",

Returns Object that has account names as keys, account balances as values.\n\nArguments:\n1. minconf     (numeric, optional, default=1) Only include transactions with at least this many confirmations\n2. includeWatchonly (bool, optional, default=false) Include balances in watchonly addresses (see 'importaddress')\n\nResult:\n{           (json object where keys are account names, and values are numeric balances\n \"account\": x.xxx, (numeric) The property name is the account name, and the value is the total balance for the account.\n ...\n}\n\nExamples:\n\nList account balances where there at least 1 confirmation\n> verus listaccounts\n\nList account balances including zero confirmation transactions\n> verus listaccounts 0\n\nList account balances for 6 or more confirmations\n> verus listaccounts 6\n\nAs json rpc call\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"listaccounts\", \"params\": [6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
