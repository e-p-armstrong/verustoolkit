            "When defining a currency or chain on the Verus platform, there are several properties and settings that can be configured to control various aspects of the currency or chain's behavior. These properties and settings can be categorized into several groups, including:\n\n**Block Settings:** \n* `startblock`: This property specifies the block number on the current chain that must be notarized into block one of the new chain.\n* `endblock`: This property specifies the block number after which the useful life of the chain is considered to be over.\n\n**Currency Conversion Settings:** \n* `currencies`: This property specifies an array of currencies that can be converted to the new currency at launch or that make up a liquidity basket.\n* `weights`: This property specifies an array of relative currency weights, which is only returned for a liquidity basket.\n* `conversions`: This property specifies an array of pre-launch conversion rates for non-fractional currencies.\n* `minpreconversion`: This property specifies an array of minimum amounts required in pre-conversions for the currency to launch.\n\n**Currency Information:** \n* `currencynames`: This property specifies an object that maps i-addresses to fully qualified names of all sub-currencies.\n\n**Supply and Allocation Settings:** \n* `initialsupply`: This property specifies the initial currency supply for fractional currencies before preallocation or issuance.\n* `pre!aunchcarveout`: This property specifies the pre-launch percentage of proceeds for fractional currency sent to the launching ID.\n* `preallocations`: This property specifies an array of objects that contain VerusIDs and amounts for pre-allocation at launch.\n* `initialcontributions`: This property specifies an array of amounts of pre-conversions reserved for the launching ID.\n\n**ID Registration and Referral Settings:** \n* `idregistrationfees`: This property specifies the base cost of IDs for this currency namespace in this currency.\n* `idreferrallevels`: This property specifies the levels of ID referrals, which is only applicable for native PBaaS chains and IDs.\n* `idimportfees`: This property specifies the fees required to import an ID to this system, which is only applicable for native PBaaS chains.\n\nThese properties and settings provide a high degree of customization and control over the behavior of currencies and chains on the Verus platform, allowing developers to create complex and tailored cryptocurrency ecosystems.",
