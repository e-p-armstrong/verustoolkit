            "The `getbalance` command in Verus is used to retrieve the total available balance in a Verus wallet. It returns the server's total available balance, which is the total amount of VRSC received for a specific account.\n\nThe `getbalance` command takes three optional arguments:\n\n1. \"account\" (string, optional): This argument is deprecated and should be set to the empty string \"\" or to the string \"*\", which will give the total available balance.\n2. minconf (numeric, optional, default=1): This argument specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for a transaction to be included in the balance calculation.\n3. includeWatchonly (bool, optional, default=false): This argument specifies whether to include balance in watch-only addresses (i.e., addresses that are being monitored but not controlled by the wallet).\n\nThe result of the `getbalance` command is the total amount in VRSC received for the specified account, which is returned as a numeric value.\n\nThe `getbalance` command can be used in various ways, such as:\n\n* To retrieve the total amount in the wallet: `verus getbalance`\n* To retrieve the total amount in the wallet with at least 5 blocks confirmed: `verus getbalance \"*\" 6`\n* As a JSON RPC call: `curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getbalance\", \"params\": [\"*\", 6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`\n\nOverall, the `getbalance` command provides a convenient way to retrieve the total available balance in a Verus wallet, allowing users to easily monitor their VRSC balance.",
