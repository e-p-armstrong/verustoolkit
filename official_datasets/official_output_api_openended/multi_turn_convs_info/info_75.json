            "What does the `getlaunchinfo` command do, and what information does it return about a specified currency in Verus?",
            "The `getlaunchinfo` command in Verus is used to retrieve information about the launch notarization of a specific currency. This command takes one argument, `currencyid`, which is a string that can be either a hex-encoded ID or a string name used to search for notarizations.\n\nWhen you run `getlaunchinfo` with a valid `currencyid`, it returns a JSON object containing several key pieces of information about the launch notarization of that currency. These include:\n\n1. **Currency Definition**: The full definition of the currency, represented as a JSON object.\n2. **Transaction ID (txid)**: The hexadecimal string representing the transaction ID of the launch notarization.\n3. **Vout Index (voutnum)**: The numerical index of the output in the launch notarization transaction.\n4. **Partial Transaction Proof**: A JSON object containing a partial proof of the launch transaction and output.\n5. **Launch Notarization**: A JSON object containing the final CPBaaSNotarization that cleared the launch or refund.\n6. **Notary Notarization**: A JSON object containing the current notarization of the chain.\n\nThe `getlaunchinfo` command can be used via the Verus command-line interface or by sending a JSON-RPC request to the Verus daemon. This command provides a way to access and verify the launch notarization data for a specific currency in Verus.",
