            "How can I list the balances of my accounts in Verus, and what options do I have to customize the results?",
            "You can list the balances of your accounts in Verus using the `listreceivedbyaccount` command. This command allows you to view the total amount received by each account, along with the number of confirmations for the most recent transaction.\n\nThe `listreceivedbyaccount` command takes three optional arguments:\n\n1. `minconf`: This is the minimum number of confirmations required for a payment to be included in the results. The default value is 1.\n2. `includeempty`: This is a boolean value that determines whether to include accounts that haven't received any payments. The default value is `false`.\n3. `includeWatchonly`: This is a boolean value that determines whether to include watchonly addresses (i.e., addresses that have been imported using the `importaddress` command) in the results. The default value is `false`.\n\nThe command returns a list of objects, each representing an account. The objects contain the following properties:\n\n* `involvesWatchonly`: A boolean value indicating whether any imported addresses were involved in the transaction.\n* `account`: The name of the account.\n* `amount`: The total amount received by addresses with this account.\n* `confirmations`: The number of confirmations for the most recent transaction included.\n\nYou can customize the results by specifying the `minconf`, `includeempty`, and `includeWatchonly` arguments. For example, to include accounts with at least 6 confirmations and include empty accounts, you can use the command `listreceivedbyaccount 6 true`.",
