            "What is the purpose of the `dumpwallet` command in Verus, and how can it be used to export wallet keys in a human-readable format?",
            "The `dumpwallet` command in Verus is used to export wallet keys in a human-readable format to a file. This command is useful for backing up or transferring wallet keys. The command requires two arguments: the filename to save the exported keys to, and an optional boolean flag to only include addresses with indexed UTXOs or that control IDs in the wallet.\n\nThe filename argument specifies the name of the file where the exported keys will be saved. This file will be saved in the folder specified by the `verusd -exportdir` option. The command will not overwrite an existing file, so you must ensure that the file does not already exist.\n\nThe optional `omitemptytaddresses` flag defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the command will only export addresses that have indexed UTXOs or control IDs in the wallet. This can be useful for reducing the size of the exported file, but you must be sure that all addresses of interest are included.\n\nThe result of the command is the full path of the destination file where the exported keys were saved.\n\nYou can use the `dumpwallet` command in two ways: either by running it directly in the Verus command line interface, or by using the JSON-RPC API with a tool like `curl`. The examples provided show how to use both methods to export wallet keys to a file named \"test\".",
