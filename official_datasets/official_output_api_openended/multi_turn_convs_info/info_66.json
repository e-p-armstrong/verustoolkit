            "What is the purpose of the `getNotarisationsForBlock` command in Verus, and how does it relate to the notarization process in the Verus blockchain?",
            "The `getNotarisationsForBlock` command in Verus is a utility that allows users to retrieve information about notarization transactions within a specific block on the Verus blockchain. This command takes a block hash as an input parameter and returns a list of notarization transactions that are contained within that block.\n\nIn the context of the Verus blockchain, notarization is a critical process that ensures the integrity and security of the network. Notarization involves the validation of transactions by a group of trusted nodes, known as notaries, who verify the transactions and ensure that they are legitimate and conform to the rules of the blockchain.\n\nThe `getNotarisationsForBlock` command provides a way for users to inspect the notarization process and gain insight into the transactions that have been validated by the notaries. By retrieving the notarization transactions for a specific block, users can verify the integrity of the block and ensure that the transactions within it have been properly validated.\n\nThis command is an important tool for developers, auditors, and other stakeholders who need to verify the integrity of the Verus blockchain and ensure that it is operating correctly. By providing transparent access to notarization information, the `getNotarisationsForBlock` command helps to build trust and confidence in the Verus network.",
