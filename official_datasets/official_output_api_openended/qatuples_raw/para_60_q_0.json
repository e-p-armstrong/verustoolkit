    "How can I use the `z_listreceivedbyaddress` command to get a list of amounts received by a zaddr belonging to the node's wallet, and what information does it provide about each transaction?",
    "The `z_listreceivedbyaddress` command is used to retrieve a list of amounts received by a specific private zaddr (zk-SNARKs address) belonging to the node's wallet. It requires two arguments: the private address and an optional minimum confirmation number.\n\nThe command returns a JSON object containing information about each transaction that has been received by the specified zaddr. This information includes:\n\n1. `txid`: the transaction ID\n2. `amount`: the amount of value in the note (i.e., the transaction amount)\n3. `memo`: a hexadecimal string representation of the memo field (if present)\n4. `jsindex` and `jsoutindex`: the joinsplit index and output index of the joinsplit (for Sprout transactions)\n5. `outindex`: the output index (for Sapling transactions)\n6. `confirmations`: the number of block confirmations of the transaction\n7. `change`: a boolean indicating whether the address that received the note is also one of the sending addresses\n\nBy default, the command includes transactions with at least one confirmation. However, you can specify a higher minimum confirmation number using the `minconf` argument.\n\nThe `z_listreceivedbyaddress` command can be used in the Verus command-line interface or through RPC calls using tools like `curl`. This allows you to programmatically access and process transaction data for a specific zaddr.",
