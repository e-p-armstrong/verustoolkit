    "What is the purpose of the `submitacceptednotarization` command in Verus, and how does it work?",
    "The `submitacceptednotarization` command in Verus is used to complete a nearly finished notarization transaction based on the notary chain and the current wallet or pubkey. This command is essential for finalizing a notarization process.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nTo use `submitacceptednotarization`, you need to provide two required arguments: `earnednotarization` and `notaryevidence`. \n\n1. `earnednotarization` is an object that represents the notarization earned on another system, which serves as the basis for this transaction.\n2. `notaryevidence` is an object that contains the evidence and notary signatures that validate the notarization.\n\nWhen you run the command with these arguments, it will attempt to submit the transaction based on all the rules and regulations of the notary chain and the current wallet or pubkey. If the submission is successful, the command will return a transaction ID (txid) in hexadecimal format. If the submission is unsuccessful, it will return NULL.\n\nYou can use this command in two ways: either by running `verus submitacceptednotarization \"{earnednotarization}\" \"{notaryevidence}\"` directly in the command line, or by using a curl request with the necessary parameters, as shown in the example.\n\nIn summary, `submitacceptednotarization` is a crucial command in Verus that helps finalize notarization transactions by submitting evidence and notary signatures to the notary chain, and it returns a transaction ID if the submission is successful.",
