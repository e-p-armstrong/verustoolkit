    "How do I export a private key from a z-addr in Verus, and what are the parameters involved in this process?",
    "In Verus, you can export a private key from a z-addr using the `z_exportkey` command. This command takes two parameters: the z-addr for which you want to export the private key, and an optional boolean flag to output the key data as hex bytes.\n\nThe general syntax for this command is:\n```\nz_exportkey \"zaddr\" (outputashex)\n```\nHere, `\"zaddr\"` is the z-addr for which you want to export the private key, and `outputashex` is a boolean flag that defaults to `false`. If `outputashex` is set to `true`, the private key data will be output as hex bytes.\n\nWhen you run this command, Verus will output the private key corresponding to the specified z-addr. You can then use this private key with the `z_importkey` command.\n\nFor example, if you want to export the private key for a z-addr called \"myaddress\", you can run the following command:\n```\nverus z_exportkey \"myaddress\"\n```\nThis will output the private key for \"myaddress\". You can then use this private key with `z_importkey`.\n\nIt's also possible to use this command with a JSON-RPC interface, such as with the `curl` command. For example:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_exportkey\", \"params\": [\"myaddress\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nThis will also output the private key for \"myaddress\".",
    "z_exportkey \"zaddr\" (outputashex)\n\nReveals the zkey corresponding to 'zaddr'.\nThen the z_importkey can be used with this output\n\nArguments:\n1. \"zaddr\"  (string, required) The zaddr for the private key\n2. \"outputashex\" (boolean, optional, default=false) If true, output key data as hex bytes\n\nResult:\n\"key\"         (string) The private key\n\nExamples:\n> verus z_exportkey \"myaddress\"\n> verus z_importkey \"mykey\"\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_exportkey\", \"params\": [\"myaddress\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
