    "What is the purpose of the `zcrawkeygen` command, and what output can I expect from it?",
    "The `zcrawkeygen` command is used to generate a Zero-Knowledge Address (zcaddr) that can send and receive confidential values. This command is deprecated, meaning it's no longer recommended for use, but it's still important to understand its purpose.\n\nWhen you run the `zcrawkeygen` command, it generates a set of keys that are used to manage and interact with confidential values on the Verus network. The output of this command consists of three main components:\n\n1. **zcaddress**: This is the Zero-Knowledge Address that can send and receive confidential values. This address is used to identify the recipient of confidential transactions.\n\n2. **zcsecretkey**: This is the secret key associated with the zcaddress. It's used to control and manage the zcaddress, and it's essential for sending and receiving confidential values.\n\n3. **zcviewingkey**: This is the viewing key associated with the zcaddress. It's used to view the confidential values received by the zcaddress, allowing the owner to see the contents of confidential transactions.\n\nIn summary, the `zcrawkeygen` command generates a set of keys that enable the creation and management of confidential transactions on the Verus network. While it's deprecated, understanding its purpose and output is essential for working with confidential values on the Verus platform.",
