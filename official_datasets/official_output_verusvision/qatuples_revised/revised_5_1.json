    "What are the core beliefs that underpin the Verus team's vision for creating a better digital system?",
    "The Verus team's vision is based on three core beliefs:\n\n1. Every human has valuable ideas, knowledge, and contributions to make to society, and technology can be used to reward and amplify these contributions.\n2. Those who contribute positively to the system over time should be rewarded and incentivized to continue doing so.\n3. A world-scale, peer-to-peer system that enables confidential, verifiable, and transparent communication can provide valuable tools for individuals and populations to build a better world together.",
    "thrust at us in daily life. We are told to give up on the notion of privacy and to\ntrust networks of companies with our most private data, our identity, our credit histories, our\nlocation, our habits. We are also told that our voices are lost in the digital sea of information.\nYet how is this the same sea through which we are laser-targeted based on correlating our\nbehaviors to learn so much about us, individually? What if these technologies could be\nturned towards the benefit of society, first \u2013 and then allowed to support businesses, in that\ncontext?\nWe on the Verus team believe it is possible to support businesses and governments\nrequirements with digital systems that: 1) respect your privacy, 2) give you control over\nyour data, and 3) enable you to speak your mind with the anonymous authority of an\nauthorized voter or member of a community, in a way that can directly be heard and affect\nactual change.\nBefore we explain how, it would help to understand the shared beliefs behind our vision\nfor Verus. These beliefs underpin everything we build into the Verus network:\n1. We believe that every human has ideas, knowledge, and value to contribute to our\nsociety. By using technology to reward people for their contributions, we can enable\neach of our verifiable, yet anonymous voices to be heard as a collective truth.\n2. We believe that those who contribute positively over time to the system should be\nrewarded for that contribution and provided with ongoing incentive.\n3. We believe that a world-scale, peer-to-peer system that can enable humans to be\nqueried directly, confidentially, verifiably \u2013 and in a transparent manner \u2013 can directly\nprovide populations of people and the world with valuable, transformative tools.\nWith Verus, we will introduce digital tools to enable us all to build a better world\ntogether. We will monetarily incentivize \u2013 with our technologies \u2013 behavio",
