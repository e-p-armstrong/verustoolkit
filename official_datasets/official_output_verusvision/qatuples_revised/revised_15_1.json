    "What is the focus of phase four of Verus's development?",
    "In phase four, Verus will focus on leveraging the foundation built in the previous phases to develop broad content classification capabilities for off-chain content. Additionally, it will improve storage management support in its distributed hash table implementations, support storage monetization, and provide open-source, public implementations of machine learning systems that can learn from data on the Verus network to solve real-world challenges.",
    "In phase three, we plan to further improve the mobile experiences, implement the identity system, including support for strong, decentralized identity and attestations, separating\nphoto IDs and other photo content into components that can be separately verified in unbiased human polls. At this point, we intend to support optional KYC strong identities, via\nboth notarization of identities as well as poll-based identity verification. This will also be\nthe first phase that supports Verus chain validation PoV enhanced PoS.4.4Phase Four \u2013 Integrated Machine Learning, Content, StorageIn phase four, Verus will begin to truly leverage the foundation built in phases one, two, and\nthree by focusing on broad content classification capabilities for off-chain content, improving storage management support in its distributed hash table implementations, supporting\nstorage monetization in some way, and providing open source, public implementations of\nmachine learning systems that can learn from data on the Verus network to solve real world\nchallenges of today and tomorrow.225Forward Looking Statements",
