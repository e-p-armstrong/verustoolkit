    "The Verus Project's approach to identity management reflects real-life identity expression by allowing users to create multiple personas, each representing a different facet of their identity. This mirrors how people express their identity in different situations, such as requiring provable credibility in some cases and revealing limited information in others, like when encountering a casual stranger.",
    "r that strengthens\ncommunities and institutions. This is the thing that\u2019s missing in the online world today:\nFiscal incentive for communal behavior built into the very fabric of its function.\nThe Verus Project\u2019s tools will make it easy to create an identity \u2013 or multiple identities\n\u2013 on the Verus multi-blockchain system, which can accumulate value and even have multiple\npersonas, each to represent a facet of your identity as a whole. This reflects how we might\nexpress identity in our personal or professional lives, where some situations call for provable credibility, yet others require no more information than what you might reveal when\nencountering a casual stranger.\n3",
