            "The Bitcoin protocol rewards miners in statistical proportion to the computing power they employ to \"mine\" for Bitcoin, as compared to the total computing power of all miners. The winner of each competition earns the right to accurately process the next block of pending Bitcoin transactions and to claim a specific measure of Bitcoin, called the \"block reward\" (plus fees of all transactions in the block that was processed).",
