            "almost completely parallel and isolated from the main Verus chain, except for the capability\nof posting transactions and proofs to Verus, for results and coordination across applications\nor people.\nBy combining privacy, polls at scale, and identity, Verus can be used to post polls and\nask almost any question of a population or subpopulation of people, receive an honest \u2013 and,\nimportantly \u2013 verifiable answer, and still respect the privacy of the respondents. When even\nthe first support for polling is active on the Verus network, the Verus community will be\nable to vote on the long term direction of the Verus Project, itself.\nOver time, Verus polls \u2013 used for purposes such as determining the accuracy of news\nonline, for research, or even for political polling, will be combined with machine learning\nto enable all of us, as a society, to benefit directly from our collective intelligence without\ntoday\u2019s risks to our individual privacy. Verus will combine auditability and verifiability of\ntransactions with the option of verified, confidential participation \u2013 meaning societies and\norganizations can directly understand what people think, feel, and believe, as populations \u2013\nwithout taking control of their personal data or targeting some individuals, based on their\nanswers or beliefs.\nUltimately, our vision for the Verus Project is to enable us all to directly participate\nin our own worldwide economy. Verus applications will enable any individual to speak up\nwith the power of an authorized participant \u2013 and with the confidence of anonymity \u2013 to\nproduce a verifiable, transparent, and honest flow of information throughout the globe. It\nwill transform the way that anonymity functions in our current technological environment \u2013\nprioritizing cooperation and providing the financial incentive for that cooperation to occur.3Important Verus Concepts",
