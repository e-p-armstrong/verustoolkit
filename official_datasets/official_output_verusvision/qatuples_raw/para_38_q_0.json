    "How does Verus's proof of stake lottery system work?",
    "Verus's proof of stake lottery system is a mechanism that allows users to claim the right to validate a block and its associated reward based on proof-of-stake (for autochains) or 50/50 PoW/PoS (for the main chain). To participate in the lottery, a user must have a qualifying UTXO (unspent transaction output) that meets certain conditions. Specifically, the prior block hash 100 blocks past combined with the qualifying UTXO of the destination public key hashed with the staking block height and then divided by the UTXO value must be under the current proof of stake validation difficulty. This system weights proof-of-stake or proof-of-virtue in proportion to the amount of stake or virtue in the UTXO.",
    "Proof of Stake LotteryA block validation lottery is a somewhat different form of lottery which allows you to claim\nthe right to validate a block and its associated reward based on proof-of-stake (for autochains)\nor 50/50 PoW/PoS (for the main chain). The lottery requires that a prior block hash 100\nblocks past combined with a qualifying UTXO of the destination public key hashed with the\nstaking block height and then divided by the UTXO value must be under the current proof\nof stake validation difficulty. By dividing by the UTXO value, Verus weights proof-of-stake\nor proof-of-virtue in proportion to the amount of stake or virtue in the UTXO. If no one who\nqualifies to validate a block is online or no one responds with a submitted block validation\nin a certain amount of time, the blockchain will wait until someone mines a block using\nproof-of-work.\n3.4.3Ticket Harvesting LotteriesThere will be multiple ways to acquire tickets to participate in any particular poll. The\nmanual ways emphasized so far may include receiving a poll with QR code in post or email\nor perhaps directly from someone taking a poll. In addition to these direct ways to receive a\nvoting ticket, Verus will enable polls to be posted on the poll blockchain as transactions, the\ntickets for which are distributed from its outputs by lottery. This will work when the Verus\nID functionality is available, and will enable polls to require presence of specific claims or\nattestations on an ID, as well as the number of participants to select in the poll by creating\none transaction output for each, which is spendable by a cryptocondition [17] that defines\nthe lottery conditions and random difficulty. The difficulty determines how often a particular\nblock will match any attempt to harvest a ticket from that block.3.5Machine Learning Integration",
