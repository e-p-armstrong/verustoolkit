    "Verus ensures the privacy and security of identities on its platform by assigning each identity a unique address. This makes it cryptographically hard, or virtually impossible, to correlate one identity to another without the owner revealing information that links them.",
    "Each identity will have its own, unique address. Unless its owner reveals information\nto link two or more identities, it is cryptographically hard \u2013 meaning virtually impossible\n\u2013 to correlate one identity to another. At the same time, the owner of an identity can still\ncryptographically verify statements made about identities under their control, attesting to\nidentity properties (such as passport, age, height, citizenship, photo, etc.) as strongly as\nis possible with today\u2019s digital technology.
