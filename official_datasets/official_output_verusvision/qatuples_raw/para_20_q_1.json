    "What alternative consensus mechanisms are being researched and developed to address the limitations of PoW?",
    "Many alternative consensus mechanisms are being researched and developed, with a primary focus on Proof of Stake (PoS). PoS is based on the idea that validators will choose good behavior within the ecosystem because they have a stake commensurate with the value being transacted, and they do not want to lose their stake.",
    " addition to enabling secure management of large sums of money, PoW has also sparked\na mining arms race and significant investment in computing power to claim Bitcoins and other\ncryptocurrencies, creating the equivalent of the world\u2019s largest distributed supercomputer\ndoing nothing but the same calculations, albeit on different data, over and over again. As\na result, one side effect of the public blockchains\u2019 PoW security system is massive power\nconsumption and significant ecological cost.\nDue to this, a great deal of research and development has gone into alternative consensus\nmechanisms [11][12][13]. Most serious PoW alternatives center around the concept of proofof-stake (PoS) \u2013 the idea, that by putting something at stake commensurate with the value\nbeing transacted in the transaction flow, a rational staking person, known as a \u201cvalidator,\u201d\nwill choose good behavior within the ecosystem, so as not to lose their \u201cstake.\u201d\nEven though large systems are being built that depend on 100% PoS, there remains\ncontroversy over its robustness when users have incompatible interests, or when an attacker\u2019s\nstake is not valued as highly as the perceived value to be gained by corrupting the system.\nMost modern PoS and PoW systems make a fundamental assumption about all miners; that they are either \u2018byzantine\u2019, and intend to compromise the system as a whole, or",
