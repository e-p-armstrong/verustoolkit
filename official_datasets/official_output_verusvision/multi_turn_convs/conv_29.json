    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about Verus's features. What are Autochains in the context of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAutochains are automatically instantiated blockchains that are validated initially by Verus miners and later by their users. They can be used indefinitely or have a finite lifetime for a specific purpose. Autochains inherit their security from the main Verus chain, eliminating the disadvantage of weak defense against attacks in their early stages.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds cool. What are the benefits of using Autochains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAutochains offer several benefits, including: inherited security from the main Verus chain, making them more secure than traditional distributed ledger applications; versatility in their use cases, with unlimited possibilities for implementation; ability to place a value on the data generated by the autochain's operation, which can be released to the public or paid out as rewards to participants; and incentivizing the release of learning and information to the public, making applications that do so less expensive to run.\n\n**User:**\nHow will Autochain provisioning and voting protocols work in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus will define an autochain provisioning protocol and specific voting protocols based on blockchain transactions. These protocols will utilize zero-knowledge proofs, Crypto Conditions, and Interledger Protocol technologies to provide proper incentives for all participants to engage in the automatic creation and use of on-demand, isolated, or public blockchains.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also interested in how validation will work for Verus poll applications. Can you explain that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFor Verus poll applications, validation will default to a form of proof-of-stake (PoS), where all members of the chain are stakers. This security model is chosen because it matches the requirements of these applications.",
