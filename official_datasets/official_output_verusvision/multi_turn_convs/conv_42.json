    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the intrinsic polls on the Verus network. What's their purpose, and how do they benefit the participants?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe intrinsic polls on the Verus network are designed to classify and rate content across Verus applications, enabling a rating system rather than censorship. By participating in these polls, identities with Virtue can help the system classify and rate content, and in return, they can set preferences for the ratings of polls they wish to see. This creates a more personalized user experience for poll services. It's a great way for participants to contribute to the network and shape their own experience.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How are the content and rewards for intrinsic polls determined on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe content for intrinsic polls is taken from other polls and is used to classify and rate those polls for easier discoverability. Miners who provision autochains for these intrinsic polls receive the same rewards as miners setting up autochains for commissioned polls. It's a win-win for everyone involved!\n\n**User:**\nI've heard of Virtue in the context of Verus, but I'm not entirely sure what it means. Can you explain the role of Virtue in the Verus network, and how it relates to participating in intrinsic polls?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVirtue is a measure that determines an identity's eligibility to participate in intrinsic polls on the Verus network. Identities with Virtue are regularly available to participate in these polls, which are based on a statistical lottery and weighted by their actual measure of Virtue. It's a way to ensure that participants are contributing to the network in a meaningful way, and it helps to maintain the integrity of the poll system.",
