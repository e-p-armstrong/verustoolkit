    "The possible values for the `status` field are:\n\n1. \"invalid\": This branch contains at least one invalid block.\n2. \"headers-only\": Not all blocks for this branch are available, but the headers are valid.\n3. \"valid-headers\": All blocks are available for this branch, but they were never fully validated.\n4. \"valid-fork\": This branch is not part of the active chain, but is fully validated.\n5. \"active\": This is the tip of the active main chain, which is certainly valid.",
