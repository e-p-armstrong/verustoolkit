    "The expected output of the `zcrawjoinsplit` command is a JSON object containing three fields: `\"encryptednote1\": enc1`, `\"encryptednote2\": enc2`, and `\"rawtxn\": rawtxout`.",

Splices a joinsplit into rawtx. Inputs are unilaterally confidential.\nOutputs are confidential between sender/receiver. The vpub_old and\nvpub_new values are globally public and move transparent value into\nor out of the confidential value store, respectively.\n\nNote: The caller is responsible for delivering the output enc1 and\nenc2 to the appropriate recipients, as well as signing rawtxout and\nensuring it is mined. (A future RPC call will deliver the confidential\npayments in-band on the blockchain.)\n\nOutput: {\n \"encryptednote1\": enc1,\n \"encryptednote2\": enc2,\n \"rawtxn\": rawtxout\n}",
