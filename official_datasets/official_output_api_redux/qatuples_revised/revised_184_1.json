    "What is the purpose of the `eras` component in a currency definition in Verus?",
    "The `eras` component in a currency definition in Verus represents different chain phases of rewards and convertibility. Each era is defined by an object with four properties:\n\n* `reward`: the reward start for each era in native coin\n* `decay`: the exponential or linear decay of rewards during each era\n* `halving`: the blocks between halvings during each era\n* `eraend`: the block marking the end of each era\n\nThe `eras` component allows for the definition of multiple phases of a currency's lifecycle, with varying reward structures and convertibility rules.",
