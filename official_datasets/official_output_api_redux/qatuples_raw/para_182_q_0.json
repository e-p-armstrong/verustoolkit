    "What is the purpose of the `addmergedblock` command in Verus?",
    "The `addmergedblock` command adds a fully prepared block and its header to the current merge mining queue of the Verus daemon. This allows you to add a new block to the merge mining process, which can be useful for various use cases such as adding a new block to a specific chain or replacing an existing block with a more profitable one.",
    "addmergedblock \"hexdata\" ( \"jsonparametersobject\" )\n\nAdds a fully prepared block and its header to the current merge mining queue of this daemon.\nParameters determine the action to take if adding this block would exceed the available merge mining slots.\nDefault action to take if adding would exceed available space is to replace the choice with the least ROI if this block provides more.\n\nArguments\n1. \"hexdata\"           (string, required) the hex-encoded, complete, unsolved block data to add. nTime, and nSolution are replaced.\n2. \"name\"            (string, required) chain name symbol\n3. \"rpchost\"           (string, required) host address for RPC connection\n4. \"rpcport\"           (int,  required) port address for RPC connection\n5. \"userpass\"          (string, required) credentials for login to RPC\n\nResult:\n\"deserialize-invalid\" - block could not be deserialized and was rejected as invalid\n\"blocksfull\"     - block did not exceed others in estimated ROI, and there was no room for an additional merge mined block\n{\"nextblocktime\": n} - block has invalid time and must be remade with time returned\n\nExamples:\n> verus addmergedblock \"hexdata\" '{\"currencyid\" : \"hexstring\", \"rpchost\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"rpcport\" : portnum}'\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"addmergedblock\", \"params\": [\"hexdata\" '{\"currencyid\" : \"hexstring\", \"rpchost\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"rpcport\" : portnum, \"estimatedroi\" : (verusreward/hashrate)}'] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
