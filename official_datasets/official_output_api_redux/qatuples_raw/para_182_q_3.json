    "The possible results of the `addmergedblock` command are:\n\n1. \"deserialize-invalid\" - the block could not be deserialized and was rejected as invalid.\n2. \"blocksfull\" - the block did not exceed others in estimated ROI, and there was no room for an additional merge mined block.\n3. {\"nextblocktime\": n} - the block has an invalid time and must be remade with the returned time.",
