    "What are the optional arguments for the `z_shieldcoinbase` API call?",
    "The optional arguments for the `z_shieldcoinbase` API call are:\n\n1. fee - a numeric value, which is the fee amount to attach to this transaction (default is 0.0001).\n2. limit - a numeric value, which is the limit on the maximum number of utxos to shield (default is 50).",
    "z_shieldcoinbase \"fromaddress\" \"tozaddress\" ( fee ) ( limit )THIS API IS DEPRECATED AND NON NECESSARY TO USE ON VERUS OR STANDARD PBAAS NETWORKS\nShield transparent coinbase funds by sending to a shielded zaddr. This is an asynchronous operation and utxos\nselected for shielding will be locked. If there is an error, they are unlocked. The RPC call `listlockunspent`\ncan be used to return a list of locked utxos. The number of coinbase utxos selected for shielding can be limited\nby the caller. If the limit parameter is set to zero, and Overwinter is not yet active, the -mempooltxinputlimit\noption will determine the number of uxtos. Any limit is constrained by the consensus rule defining a maximum\ntransaction size of 100000 bytes before Sapling, and 2000000 bytes once Sapling activates.Arguments:\n1. \"fromaddress\"     (string, required) The address is a taddr or \"*\" for all taddrs belonging to the wallet.\n2. \"toaddress\"      (string, required) The address is a zaddr.\n3. fee          (numeric, optional, default=0.0001) The fee amount to attach to this transaction.\n4. limit         (numeric, optional, default=50) Limit on the maximum number of utxos to shield. Set to 0 to use node option -mempooltxinputlimit (before Overwinter), or as many as will fit in the transaction (after Overwinter).Result:\n{\n \"remainingUTXOs\": xxx    (numeric) Number of coinbase utxos still available for shielding.\n \"remainingValue\": xxx    (numeric) Value of coinbase utxos still available for shielding.\n \"shieldingUTXOs\": xxx    (numeric) Number of coinbase utxos being shielded.\n \"shieldingValue\": xxx    (numeric) Value of coinbase utxos being shielded.\n \"opid\": xxx     (string) An operationid to pass to z_getoperationstatus to get the result of the operation.\n}",
