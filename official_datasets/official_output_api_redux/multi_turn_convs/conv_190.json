    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand Verus blockchain definitions a bit better. What's the purpose of the \"eras\" property in a Verus blockchain definition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"eras\" property in a Verus blockchain definition is used to define different phases of rewards and convertibility on the chain. Each era has its own settings for reward start, decay, halving, and end block. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and customization in designing the reward structure and evolution of the blockchain over time.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the \"reward\" property within an era definition? What does that do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"reward\" property in an era definition specifies the starting reward in native coins for each era. This sets the initial reward amount for miners or validators on the blockchain, which can then decay or change according to the era's settings. Does that clarify things?",
