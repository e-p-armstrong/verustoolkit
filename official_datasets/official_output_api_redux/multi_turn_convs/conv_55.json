    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to explore my Verus wallet and I came across the `z_listaddresses` command. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_listaddresses` command returns a list of all Sprout and Sapling shielded addresses belonging to the wallet. It can also include watchonly addresses if the `includeWatchonly` argument is set to `true`.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds useful. How do I use the `z_listaddresses` command to get a list of shielded addresses in my Verus wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_listaddresses` command by simply running `verus z_listaddresses` in your terminal. If you want to include watchonly addresses, you can add the `includeWatchonly` argument, like this: `verus z_listaddresses true`. You can also use the command with a JSON-RPC call, as shown in the example: `curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_listaddresses\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I've run the command. What format is the result returned in?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `z_listaddresses` command is a JSON array of strings, where each string represents a shielded address belonging to the wallet.",
