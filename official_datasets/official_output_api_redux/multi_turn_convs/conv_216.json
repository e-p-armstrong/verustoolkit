    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `verifysignature` method in Verus, but I'm not sure what parameters I need to pass to it. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `verifysignature` method in Verus requires three parameters. You'll need to provide:\n1. `identity`: The Verus ID of the entity that signed the message.\n2. `message`: The original message that was signed.\n3. `signature`: The base64-encoded digital signature of the message.\n\nThese parameters are necessary to verify the authenticity of the signature and ensure that it was generated by the specified identity for the given message. Make sure you have all three of these parameters correct, and the `verifysignature` method should work as expected. Do you have any other questions about using this method or Verus in general?",
