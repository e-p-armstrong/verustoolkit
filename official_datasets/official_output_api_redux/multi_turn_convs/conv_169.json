    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the `listreceivedbyaccount` command in Verus. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listreceivedbyaccount` command is used to list balances by account in Verus. It returns a list of accounts with their corresponding total received amounts and the number of confirmations of the most recent transaction included. Is that what you were looking for?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! What are the arguments that can be passed to the `listreceivedbyaccount` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listreceivedbyaccount` command takes three optional arguments:\n\n1. `minconf`: The minimum number of confirmations before payments are included. The default value is 1.\n2. `includeempty`: A boolean indicating whether to include accounts that haven't received any payments. The default value is false.\n3. `includeWatchonly`: A boolean indicating whether to include watchonly addresses (see 'importaddress'). The default value is false.\n\nDo you have any other questions about these arguments or the command in general?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. What is the format of the result returned by the `listreceivedbyaccount` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `listreceivedbyaccount` command is a JSON array of objects, each containing the following properties:\n\n1. `involvesWatchonly`: A boolean indicating whether imported addresses were involved in the transaction. Only returned if imported addresses were involved.\n2. `account`: The account name of the receiving account.\n3. `amount`: The total amount received by addresses with this account.\n4. `confirmations`: The number of confirmations of the most recent transaction included.\n\nIs that what you were expecting?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks! How can I use the `listreceivedbyaccount` command to list balances by account with a minimum of 6 confirmations and including empty accounts?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `listreceivedbyaccount` command with the following syntax:\n\n```\nverus listreceivedbyaccount 6 true\n```\n\nThis will list the balances by account with a minimum of 6 confirmations and include accounts that haven't received any payments. Give it a try!",
