    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to figure out the `importaddress` command in Verus. Can you tell me what it's for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `importaddress` command allows you to add an address or script (in hex) to your wallet that can be watched, but not used to spend. This means you can track transactions related to the imported address without having control over the funds. Do you have any other questions about it?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What are the required and optional arguments for the `importaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `importaddress` command takes three arguments:\n\n1. `\"address\"` (string, required): The address to be imported.\n2. `\"label\"` (string, optional, default=\"\"): An optional label for the imported address.\n3. `rescan` (boolean, optional, default=true): A flag indicating whether to rescan the wallet for transactions.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens if I set `rescan` to `true` when using the `importaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you set `rescan` to `true`, the wallet will be rescanned for transactions related to the imported address. This can take minutes to complete, depending on the size of the wallet and the number of transactions. Are you planning on importing an address and wondering about the implications?\n\n**User:**\nYes, exactly. How can I import an address with a label and without rescanning the wallet using the `importaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can import an address with a label and without rescanning the wallet by using the following command:\n```\nverus importaddress \"myaddress\" \"testing\" false\n```\nThis command imports the address `\"myaddress\"` with the label `\"testing\"` and sets `rescan` to `false`, which means the wallet will not be rescanned for transactions.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's helpful. How can I use the `importaddress` command as a JSON-RPC call?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `importaddress` command as a JSON-RPC call by sending a POST request to the Verus server with the following JSON data:\n```\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\",\n  \"id\": \"curltest\",\n  \"method\": \"importaddress\",\n  \"params\": [\"myaddress\", \"testing\", false]\n}\n```\nThis will import the address `\"myaddress\"` with the label `\"testing\"` and without rescanning the wallet. Do you have any more questions about using `importaddress` or Verus in general?",
