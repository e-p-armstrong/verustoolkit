    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to learn more about Verus commands. Can you help me understand what the `z_getoperationresult` command does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getoperationresult` command retrieves the result and status of an operation that has finished, and then removes the operation from memory. This command is useful for checking the outcome of a specific operation.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. What arguments does the `z_getoperationresult` command take?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_getoperationresult` command takes an optional argument, an array of operation IDs, specifying which operations to retrieve results for. If no operation IDs are provided, the command will examine all operations known to the node. So, you can specify a specific operation or get results for all operations.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What is the format of the result returned by the `z_getoperationresult` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `z_getoperationresult` command is an array of JSON objects, each containing the result and status of an operation. This makes it easy to parse and understand the outcome of the operation.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `z_getoperationresult` command to retrieve the result of a specific operation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_getoperationresult` command to retrieve the result of a specific operation by providing the operation ID as an argument. For example, you can use the command `verus z_getoperationresult '[\"operationid\"]'` or make a JSON-RPC request using `curl` with the operation ID as a parameter. Just replace \"operationid\" with the actual ID of the operation you're interested in. Does that make sense?",
