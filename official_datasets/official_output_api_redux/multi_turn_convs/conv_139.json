    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the `getvdxfid` command in Verus. Can you explain its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getvdxfid` command is used to return the VDXF key of a URI string. It takes a URI string as input, hashes the data, and returns the VDXF key along with other related information. Would you like to know more about how to use it or its optional parameters?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What are the optional parameters that can be passed to the `getvdxfid` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getvdxfid` command accepts three optional parameters: `vdxfkey`, `uint256`, and `indexnum`. `vdxfkey` is a VDXF key or i-address to combine via hash, `uint256` is a 256-bit hash to combine with the hash, and `indexnum` is an integer to combine with the hash. Do you have any questions about how to use these parameters or what they do?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! What is the format of the result returned by the `getvdxfid` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `getvdxfid` command is an object with several properties: `vdxfid`, `hash160result`, `qualifiedname`, and `bounddata`. `vdxfid` is the base58check and hex VDXF ID values of the string and parents, `hash160result` is the 20-byte hash in hex of the URL string passed in, `qualifiedname` is an object with separate name and parent ID values, and `bounddata` is an object with additional data bound to create the value. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I think so. How can I use the `getvdxfid` command to create a signature in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo create a signature using the `getvdxfid` command, you can pass a URI string as an argument, like this: `verus getvdxfid \"system.currency.export\"`. This will return the VDXF key and other related information. From there, you can use the returned information to create a signature.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how can I use the `getvdxfid` command to verify a signature in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo verify a signature using the `getvdxfid` command, you can pass a URI string that includes the ID name and other related information, like this: `verus getvdxfid \"idname::userdefinedgroup.subgroup.publishedname\"`. This will return the VDXF key and other related information, which can be used to verify the signature.",
