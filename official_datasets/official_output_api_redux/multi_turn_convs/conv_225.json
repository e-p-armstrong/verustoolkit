    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to define a currency or chain in Verus, and I'm not sure about some of the fields. Can you help me out? Specifically, what's the purpose of the \"notarizationprotocol\" field?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"notarizationprotocol\" field determines how a currency or chain is notarized in Verus. It can take three possible values:\n\n1. 1 (PROOF_PBAASMMR): This uses Verus MMR proof and does not require notaries.\n2. 2 (PROOF_CHAINID): This uses the chain ID as the sole notary, and no evidence is required.\n3. 3 (PROOF_ETHNOTARIZATION): This uses Ethereum notarization and PATRICIA TRIE proof.\n\nDo you have any other questions about this field or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nNo, that makes sense. What about the \"expiryheight\" field? What's that used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"expiryheight\" field specifies the block height at which a transaction expires. Its default value is the current block height plus 20. This is useful for setting a time limit on transactions, so they don't remain pending indefinitely.\n\nDo you have any further questions about this field?\n\n**User:**\nI'm also defining a PBaaS chain, and I'm not sure about the \"startblock\" field. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"startblock\" field specifies the VRSC block that must be notarized into block 1 of the PBaaS chain. Its default value is the \"expiryheight\". This is crucial for establishing the connection between the VRSC blockchain and your PBaaS chain.\n\nDo you have any other questions about PBaaS chains or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand that. What about the \"currencies\" field when defining a chain? What does that represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"currencies\" field represents the reserve currencies that back a chain in equal amounts. Its purpose is to define the currencies that support the chain. This is useful for creating a stablecoin or a currency that's backed by a basket of other currencies.\n\nDo you have any further questions about this field?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What about the \"weights\" field? How does that relate to the \"currencies\" field?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"weights\" field specifies the weight of each reserve currency in a fractional currency. It is used in conjunction with the \"currencies\" field to define the relative importance of each reserve currency. This allows you to create a currency that's backed by multiple currencies with different weights or importance.\n\nDo you have any other questions about this field?\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand that. Finally, what about the \"conversions\" field? How does that relate to the \"currencies\" field?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"conversions\" field specifies the pre-launch conversion ratio overrides for each reserve currency. It must be the same size as the \"currencies\" field, and is used to define the conversion rates between the reserve currencies and the chain's native currency. This is useful for setting the initial exchange rates between the backing currencies and the new chain's currency.\n\nDo you have any other questions about Verus or chain definition?",
