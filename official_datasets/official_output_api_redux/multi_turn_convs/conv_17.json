    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with the `zcrawjoinsplit` command in Verus, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. Can you explain its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `zcrawjoinsplit` command is used to splice a joinsplit into a raw transaction. It takes inputs and outputs as JSON objects, where inputs are unilaterally confidential and outputs are confidential between the sender and receiver. Does that make sense? Do you have any questions about how it works or what it's used for?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that helps. But what exactly are the inputs and outputs of the `zcrawjoinsplit` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe inputs of the `zcrawjoinsplit` command are a JSON object mapping `{note: zcsecretkey,...}`, where each note is associated with a confidential key. The outputs are a JSON object mapping `{zcaddr: value,...}`, where each zcaddr is associated with a value. Do you have any questions about how to format these inputs and outputs?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. I've also seen `vpub_old` and `vpub_new` mentioned in the context of `zcrawjoinsplit`. What's their role?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `vpub_old` and `vpub_new` values are globally public and are used to move transparent value into or out of the confidential value store, respectively. They're an important part of how the `zcrawjoinsplit` command works, but they're not something you need to worry about directly when using the command.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. What's my responsibility when using the `zcrawjoinsplit` command? Are there any specific steps I need to take?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, as the caller, you're responsible for delivering the output `enc1` and `enc2` to the appropriate recipients, as well as signing `rawtxout` and ensuring it is mined. So, you need to make sure you're handling the output of the command correctly and taking care of the necessary steps to complete the transaction.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, what's the expected output of the `zcrawjoinsplit` command? What can I expect to see when I run it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe expected output of the `zcrawjoinsplit` command is a JSON object containing three fields: `\"encryptednote1\": enc1`, `\"encryptednote2\": enc2`, and `\"rawtxn\": rawtxout`. This output will contain the encrypted notes and the raw transaction output, which you'll need to handle as part of the transaction process.",
