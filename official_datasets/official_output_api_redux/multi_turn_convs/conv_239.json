    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've been trying to use the `sendmany` command in Verus, but I'm not really sure what it's for or how to use it. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendmany` command in Verus is used to send multiple amounts of VRSC to multiple addresses in a single transaction. It's really useful when you need to send VRSC to multiple people or accounts at once.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds useful. What's the format of the `sendmany` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe format of the `sendmany` command is: `sendmany \"fromaccount\" {\"address\":amount,...} ( minconf \"comment\" [\"address\",...] )`. It might look a bit complex, but don't worry, I can break it down for you.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the role of the \"fromaccount\" argument in the `sendmany` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"fromaccount\" argument in the `sendmany` command MUST be set to an empty string `\"\"` to represent the default account. Passing any other string will result in an error. So, just make sure to leave it empty and you'll be good to go.\n\n**User:**\nHow do I specify the amounts to be sent in the `sendmany` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe amounts to be sent are specified in a JSON object with addresses and amounts, where the VRSC address is the key and the numeric amount in VRSC is the value. It's pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it.\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the `minconf` argument in the `sendmany` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `minconf` argument in the `sendmany` command is used to specify the minimum number of confirmations required for the balance to be used. It's optional and defaults to 1, so you can usually just leave it out unless you have a specific need for a higher confirmation threshold.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I add a comment to the `sendmany` transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can add a comment to the `sendmany` transaction by specifying the \"comment\" argument, which is a string. This can be useful for keeping track of what the transaction is for or who it's from.\n\n**User:**\nHow can I specify who pays the fee in a `sendmany` transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can specify who pays the fee in a `sendmany` transaction by using the `subtractfeefromamount` argument, which is a JSON array with addresses. The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each selected address. If no addresses are specified, the sender pays the fee.",
