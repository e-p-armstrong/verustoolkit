    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand the `listunspent` command in Verus. Can you tell me what it's used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listunspent` command returns an array of unspent transaction outputs with between a specified minimum and maximum number of confirmations. It can be used to filter outputs paid to specific addresses and includes information about each output, such as the transaction ID, output index, script public key, amount, and number of confirmations. Do you have any other questions about `listunspent`?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what are the optional arguments for the `listunspent` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe optional arguments for the `listunspent` command are:\n\n1. `minconf`: the minimum number of confirmations to filter (default is 1)\n2. `maxconf`: the maximum number of confirmations to filter (default is 9999999)\n3. `\"addresses\"`: a JSON array of VRSC addresses to filter\n4. `includeshared`: a boolean indicating whether to include outputs that can also be spent by others (default is false)\n\nLet me know if you need more information!\n\n**User:**\nWhat information does the `listunspent` command return for each unspent transaction output?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listunspent` command returns an array of objects, each containing the following information about an unspent transaction output:\n\n1. `txid`: the transaction ID\n2. `vout`: the output index\n3. `generated`: a boolean indicating whether the output is a coinbase transaction output\n4. `address`: the VRSC address\n5. `account`: the associated account (DEPRECATED)\n6. `scriptPubKey`: the script public key\n7. `amount`: the transaction amount in VRSC\n8. `confirmations`: the number of confirmations\n9. `redeemScript`: the redeem script if the script public key is P2SH\n10. `spendable`: a boolean indicating whether the output can be spent by the wallet\n\nDo you have any further questions about the output of `listunspent`?\n\n**User:**\nWhat's the purpose of the `includeshared` argument when used with `listunspent`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `includeshared` argument, when set to true, includes outputs in the result that can also be spent by others.",
