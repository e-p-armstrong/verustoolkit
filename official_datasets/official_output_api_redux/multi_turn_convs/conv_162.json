    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a question about the `createrawtransaction` command in Verus. What is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `createrawtransaction` command in Verus is used to create a transaction spending given inputs and sending to specified addresses. It returns a hex-encoded raw transaction. Note that the transaction's inputs are not signed, and it is not stored in the wallet or transmitted to the network. Do you have any other questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what are the required arguments for the `createrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `createrawtransaction` command requires two arguments: \n1. \"transactions\" - a json array of json objects containing the transaction id and output number.\n2. \"addresses\" - a json object with addresses as keys and amounts as values.\n\nDo you have any questions about how to format these arguments or what they're used for?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, how do I specify the amount to be sent to an address using the `createrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can specify the amount to be sent to an address using the `createrawtransaction` command by including an object with the address as the key and the amount as the value in the \"addresses\" argument. For example: `\"{\\\"address\\\":0.01}\"`. Does that make sense? Do you have any other questions?\n\n**User:**\nIs it possible to include additional data in the transaction using the `createrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, it is possible to include additional data in the transaction using the `createrawtransaction` command by including a \"data\" field with a hex-encoded value in the \"addresses\" argument. For example: `\"{\\\"address\\\":0.01,\\\"data\\\":\\\"00010203\\\"}\"`. Do you have any other questions about including data in transactions?\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the default value of the \"expiryheight\" argument in the `createrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe default value of the \"expiryheight\" argument in the `createrawtransaction` command is the next block height plus 20 (pre-Blossom) or next block height plus 40 (post-Blossom). Do you have any other questions about the `createrawtransaction` command or Verus in general?",
