    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to learn more about the `estimatefee` command in Verus. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `estimatefee` command in Verus estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin confirmation within a specified number of blocks.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds useful. How do I actually use the `estimatefee` command, and what argument do I need to provide?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo use the `estimatefee` command, you need to provide one argument, `nblocks`, which is a numeric value representing the number of blocks within which you want the transaction to begin confirmation. The command is used as follows: `verus estimatefee nblocks`.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! What can I expect as the result of the `estimatefee` command, and what happens if not enough transactions and blocks have been observed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `estimatefee` command is an estimated fee-per-kilobyte value, `n`, which is a numeric value. If not enough transactions and blocks have been observed to make an estimate, the minimum fee is returned.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Can you give me a concrete example of how to use the `estimatefee` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nHere's an example of how to use the `estimatefee` command: `verus estimatefee 6`. In this example, the command estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin confirmation within 6 blocks.",
