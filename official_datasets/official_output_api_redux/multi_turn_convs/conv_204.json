    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about Verus. What is the `getaddressbalance` command used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getaddressbalance` command is used to retrieve the balance for one or more addresses in Verus. It requires the `addressindex` to be enabled. Do you have any other questions about this command or how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, I do. What are the arguments required for the `getaddressbalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getaddressbalance` command requires an object with two possible arguments:\n\n1. `\"addresses\"`: an array of base58check encoded addresses\n2. `\"friendlynames\"`: a boolean indicating whether to include an additional array of friendly names keyed by currency i-addresses\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any further questions?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question about the `getaddressbalance` command. What does the result of the command contain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `getaddressbalance` command contains an object with two properties:\n\n1. `\"balance\"`: the current balance in satoshis\n2. `\"received\"`: the total number of satoshis received, including change\n\nDoes that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question about the `getaddressbalance` command. How can I use it to retrieve the balance of a specific address?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getaddressbalance` command by passing a JSON object with the address(es) you want to retrieve the balance for. For example:\n\n`verus getaddressbalance '{\"addresses\": [\"RY5LccmGiX9bUHYGtSWQouNy1yFhc5rM87\"]}'`\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `curl` command to send a JSON-RPC request to the Verus node. Would you like more information about how to use the `curl` command for this?",
