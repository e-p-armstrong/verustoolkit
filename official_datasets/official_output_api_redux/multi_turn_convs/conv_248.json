    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the Verus CLI and I stumbled upon the `getidentitieswithaddress` command. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getidentitieswithaddress` command in Verus returns an array of identities that contain a specified address in their primary addresses. It can also be filtered by block height and whether the identities are active (unspent) as of the current block height.\n\nWould you like to know more about how to use this command?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that sounds useful. What arguments can I pass to the `getidentitieswithaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getidentitieswithaddress` command takes four arguments:\n\n1. `address`: a required string specifying the address to search for in the primary addresses of identities.\n2. `fromheight`: an optional number specifying the block height to start searching from (default is 0).\n3. `toheight`: an optional number specifying the block height to stop searching at (default is 0, meaning no limit).\n4. `unspent`: an optional boolean specifying whether to only return active ID UTXOs as of the current block height (default is false).\n\nDo you have any questions about these arguments or would you like to know more about the result format?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps, thanks! What's the format of the result returned by the `getidentitieswithaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `getidentitieswithaddress` command is an array of objects, where each object represents an identity that matches the search criteria. Each identity object has an additional member called `txout` that contains the transaction hash and output index.\n\nWould you like to know how to actually use this command in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please! How can I use the `getidentitieswithaddress` command in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getidentitieswithaddress` command in Verus either by running it directly in the Verus CLI or by making a JSON-RPC request to the Verus server. Here are some examples:\n\n* In the Verus CLI: `verus-cli getidentitieswithaddress <address> [<fromheight>] [<toheight>] [<unspent>]`\n* Using `curl` for a JSON-RPC request: `curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"method\": \"getidentitieswithaddress\", \"params\": [<address>, [<fromheight>], [<toheight>], [<unspent>]], \"id\": \"curltest\"}' http://localhost:1337`\n\nJust replace the placeholders with your actual values and you're good to go!",
