    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `getidentity` command in Verus, but I'm not sure how to use it. Can you help me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getidentity` command is used to retrieve information about a specific identity. You can use it by providing the identity's name followed by \"@\" or its i-address as an argument. The basic format of the command is:\n```\ngetidentity \"name@ || iid\" (height) (txproof) (txproofheight)\n```\nYou can also use the command with optional arguments to customize the result. Do you have any specific questions about how to use the `getidentity` command?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What are the optional arguments for the `getidentity` command, and what do they do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getidentity` command has three optional arguments:\n\n* `height`: This argument specifies the height at which to retrieve the identity information. If set to -1, it includes the mempool. If not provided, it defaults to the current height.\n* `txproof`: This argument is a boolean that defaults to false. If set to true, it returns a proof of the ID.\n* `txproofheight`: This argument specifies the height from which to generate the proof, and defaults to the value of `height`.\n\nThese arguments allow you to customize the result of the `getidentity` command to suit your needs.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! How can I use the `getidentity` command to retrieve a proof of an identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo retrieve a proof of an identity using the `getidentity` command, you need to set the `txproof` argument to true. For example:\n```\ngetidentity \"name@\" true\n```\nThis will return a proof of the ID as of the current height. You can also specify a specific height from which to generate the proof using the `txproofheight` argument.",
