    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with Verus, and I'm not entirely sure what the `generate` function does. Can you tell me a bit more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `generate` function in Verus is used to mine blocks immediately, before the RPC call returns. This function can only be used on the regtest network. It takes one argument, `numblocks`, which specifies the number of blocks to be generated. The result is an array of block hashes that were generated.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. So, how can I actually use the `generate` function to generate a specific number of blocks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can generate a specific number of blocks using the `generate` function by specifying the number of blocks as an argument. For example, to generate 11 blocks, you would use the command `verus generate 11`. Just replace `11` with the number of blocks you want to generate, and you're good to go!",
