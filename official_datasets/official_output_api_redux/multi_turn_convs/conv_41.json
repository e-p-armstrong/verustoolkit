    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `sendtoaddress` command in Verus. Can you tell me what it's used for?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendtoaddress` command is used to send a specified amount of VRSC to a given VRSC address. It allows you to transfer funds from your wallet to another user's wallet. Do you have any other questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I do. What are the required arguments for the `sendtoaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required arguments for the `sendtoaddress` command are:\n1. The VRSC address to send to (`\"VRSC_address\"`).\n2. The amount in VRSC to send (`\"amount\"`).\n\nThese are the minimum requirements to execute the command. Do you want to know more about the optional arguments?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What is the purpose of the `\"comment\"` and `\"comment-to\"` arguments in the `sendtoaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `\"comment\"` and `\"comment-to\"` arguments are optional and allow you to add notes to the transaction in your wallet. The `\"comment\"` is a description of the transaction, and the `\"comment-to\"` is the name of the person or organization you're sending the transaction to. These comments are not part of the transaction itself and are only stored in your wallet.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What about the `subtractfeefromamount` argument? What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `subtractfeefromamount` argument is optional and defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the transaction fee will be deducted from the amount being sent, resulting in the recipient receiving less VRSC than the amount specified in the command.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, and what happens if the `sendtoaddress` command is successful?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of a successful `sendtoaddress` command is the transaction ID (`\"transactionid\"`). This ID can be used to track the status of the transaction on the blockchain.",
