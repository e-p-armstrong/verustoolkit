    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with Verus and I came across the `migrate_completeimporttransaction` command. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `migrate_completeimporttransaction` command is used to extend a proof generated on an asset chain to a target chain proof root. This is typically used in cross-chain import transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What type of transaction does this command work with, exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `migrate_completeimporttransaction` command works with cross-chain import transactions.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So what exactly does the `migrate_completeimporttransaction` command do to the proof generated on an asset chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `migrate_completeimporttransaction` command extends the proof generated on an asset chain to a target chain proof root. Does that clarify things for you? Do you have any more questions about Verus or this command?",
