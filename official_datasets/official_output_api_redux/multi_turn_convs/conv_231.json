    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I was trying to encrypt my wallet in Verus, but I'm not really sure what the `encryptwallet` command does. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `encryptwallet` command is used to encrypt your wallet with a passphrase. This is typically done for the first time encryption of your wallet. After encryption, any calls that interact with private keys, such as sending or signing, will require the passphrase to be set prior to making these calls. Do you have any more questions about wallet encryption?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. What's the minimum length of the passphrase required for encrypting a wallet in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe passphrase must be at least 1 character long, but it is recommended to use a longer and stronger passphrase for better security. It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to securing your wallet!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So how do I set a passphrase to use my wallet after encrypting it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `walletpassphrase` command to set a passphrase to use your wallet. For example:\n\n```\nverus walletpassphrase \"my pass phrase\"\n```\n\nThis will set the passphrase for your wallet, and you'll be able to make transactions and interact with your private keys.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how do I lock my wallet again after setting a passphrase?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `walletlock` command to lock your wallet again and remove the passphrase. For example:\n\n```\nverus walletlock\n```\n\nThis will lock your wallet, and you'll need to set the passphrase again to use it.\n\n**User:**\nWhat if I want to change my wallet passphrase if it's already encrypted?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `walletpassphrasechange` command to change your wallet passphrase if it is already encrypted. Note that this will shut down the server. Just be careful when changing your passphrase, as it's an important part of securing your wallet!",
