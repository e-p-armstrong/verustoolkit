    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to figure out the `refundfailedlaunch` command in Verus. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `refundfailedlaunch` command is used to refund any funds sent to a chain if they are eligible for refund. It attempts to refund all transactions for all contributors. Do you have any experience with using this command, or is this your first time?\n\n**User:**\nNo, this is my first time. I'm not really sure how to use it. Can you walk me through how to refund contributions to a specific chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo use the `refundfailedlaunch` command, you need to provide the chain ID or full chain name as an argument. For example, you can run the command like this: `verus refundfailedlaunch \"currencyid\"`. Make sure to replace `\"currencyid\"` with the actual ID or name of the chain you want to refund.\n\n**User:**\nWhat information do I need to provide to use the `refundfailedlaunch` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo use the `refundfailedlaunch` command, you need to provide the chain ID or full chain name as a required argument. That's the only piece of information you need to provide.\n\n**User:**\nIs it possible to use the `refundfailedlaunch` command through an API call?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use the `refundfailedlaunch` command through an API call. Here is an example of how to do it using `curl`: `curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"refundfailedlaunch\", \"params\": [\"currencyid\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`. Just replace `\"myusername\"` with your actual username, and `\"currencyid\"` with the actual ID or name of the chain you want to refund.",
