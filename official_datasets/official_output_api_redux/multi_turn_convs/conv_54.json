    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring Verus transactions, and I'm curious about a few things. What is the difference between \"value\" and \"valueZat\" in a Verus transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn a Verus transaction, \"value\" represents the amount in VRSC (Verus Coin), whereas \"valueZat\" represents the amount in zatoshis, which is a smaller unit of currency (similar to satoshis in Bitcoin). Zatoshis are used to express smaller amounts of VRSC. Think of it like dollars and cents - VRSC is like the dollar unit, and zatoshis are like the cents. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks! I've also seen \"memo\" and \"memoStr\" in transactions, but I'm not entirely sure what they are. Can you explain the difference between them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn a Verus transaction, \"memo\" is a hexadecimal string representation of the memo field, which is a field that can store additional information or metadata about the transaction. \"memoStr\", on the other hand, is a string representation of the memo field, but only if the memo contains valid UTF-8 text. If the memo does not contain valid UTF-8 text, \"memoStr\" will not be returned. So, in other words, \"memo\" is the raw hexadecimal data, and \"memoStr\" is a human-readable version of that data, if it's in a format that can be read by humans.",
