    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to learn more about the commands available in Verus. Can you tell me about the `listsinceblock` command? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listsinceblock` command is used to retrieve all transactions in blocks since a specified block hash, or all transactions if the block hash is omitted. It allows you to list transactions based on a specific block or all transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful! What arguments are required for the `listsinceblock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listsinceblock` command takes three arguments:\n\n1. `blockhash`: an optional string argument specifying the block hash to list transactions since.\n2. `target-confirmations`: an optional numeric argument specifying the required confirmations, which must be 1 or more.\n3. `includeWatchonly`: an optional boolean argument, defaulting to false, to include transactions to watch-only addresses.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! What information can I expect to see in the result of the `listsinceblock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `listsinceblock` command is a JSON object containing an array of transactions, each with the following information:\n\n* `account`: the account name associated with the transaction (DEPRECATED).\n* `address`: the VRSC address of the transaction (not present for move transactions).\n* `category`: the transaction category (send, receive, or move).\n* `amount`: the amount in VRSC (negative for send, positive for receive).\n* `vout`: the vout value.\n* `fee`: the amount of the fee in VRSC (negative and only available for send transactions).\n* `confirmations`: the number of confirmations for the transaction.\n* `blockhash`: the block hash containing the transaction.\n* `blockindex`: the block index containing the transaction.\n* `blocktime`: the block time in seconds since epoch.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the `listsinceblock` command or Verus in general!",
