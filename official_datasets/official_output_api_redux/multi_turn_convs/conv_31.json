    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the `getbestproofroot` command in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getbestproofroot` command determines and returns the index of the best (most recent, valid, qualified) proof root in the list of proof roots, along with the most recent, valid proof root. Do you have any further questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What are the required arguments for the `getbestproofroot` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required arguments for the `getbestproofroot` command are:\n1. `proofroots`: an ordered array of proof roots, indexed on return.\n2. `lastconfirmed`: an integer indicating the index into the proof root array indicating the last confirmed root.\n\nDo you want to know more about the `proofroots` array or the `lastconfirmed` argument?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please tell me more about the `proofroots` array.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach proof root object in the `proofroots` array contains the following information:\n1. `version`: an integer representing the version of this proof root data structure.\n2. `type`: an integer representing the type of proof root (chain or system specific).\n3. `systemid`: a hexadecimal string representing the system the proof root is for.\n4. `height`: an unsigned 32-bit integer representing the height of this proof root.\n5. `stateroot`: a hexadecimal string representing the Merkle or merkle-style tree root for the specified block/sequence.\n6. `blockhash`: a hexadecimal string representing the hash identifier for the specified block/sequence.\n7. `power`: a hexadecimal string representing the work, stake, or combination of the two for most-work/most-power rule.\n\nIs that clear? Do you have any more questions about the `proofroots` array?\n\n**User:**\nI think so. What about the `currencies` argument? What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `currencies` argument is an optional array that specifies the currencies to query for currency states.",
