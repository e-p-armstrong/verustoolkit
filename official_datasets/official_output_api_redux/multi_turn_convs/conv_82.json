    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to clean up my wallet, and I'm not sure what the `prunespentwallettransactions` command does. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `prunespentwallettransactions` command is used to remove all spent transactions from your wallet, leaving only unspent transactions. You can also specify a transaction ID to keep, which will preserve that transaction and remove all others. Would you like to know more about how it works or what information it returns?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, that sounds useful. What information does the `prunespentwallettransactions` command return?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `prunespentwallettransactions` command returns a JSON object with three properties: `total_transactions`, which is the total number of transactions in your wallet before pruning; `remaining_transactions`, which is the number of transactions remaining in your wallet after pruning; and `removed_transactions`, which is the number of transactions removed from your wallet during pruning.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. Can I use the `prunespentwallettransactions` command to keep specific transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you can use the `prunespentwallettransactions` command with a transaction ID to keep specific transactions. If you specify a transaction ID, the command will remove all spent transactions except for the one specified. This way, you can keep certain transactions in your wallet while still cleaning up the rest.",
