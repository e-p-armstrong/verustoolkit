    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `setidentitytimelock` command in Verus, but I'm not sure about the arguments. Can you help me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `setidentitytimelock` command has several arguments. Two of them are mutually exclusive, and you can only specify one of them. These are `unlockatblock` and `setunlockdelay`. What would you like to know about these arguments?\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to know more about `unlockatblock`. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `unlockatblock` argument specifies an absolute block height at which the identity should be unlocked. The countdown to unlock starts when the transaction is mined into a block. Would you like to know more about the other argument, `setunlockdelay`?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please. What does `setunlockdelay` do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `setunlockdelay` argument specifies a delay in blocks after the unlock request is made before the identity is actually unlocked. This delay can only be circumvented by revoking and recovering the identity.\n\n**User:**\nI've also seen the `returntx` argument. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `returntx` argument is a boolean that defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the transaction is signed by the wallet and returned as a hex-serialized transaction, rather than being sent directly. In this case, the transaction must be sent manually using the `sendrawtransaction` command after any necessary signatures are applied.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the `feeoffer` argument? How does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `feeoffer` argument allows you to specify a non-standard fee amount to pay for the transaction. This can be useful in certain situations where you want to control the fee paid for the transaction.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about the `sourceoffunds` argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sourceoffunds` argument allows you to specify a transparent or private address to source all funds for fees, in order to preserve the privacy of the identity.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, what's the result of the `setidentitytimelock` command, and how does it depend on the `returntx` argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `setidentitytimelock` command is a hex string. If `returntx` is `false`, the result is the transaction ID (txid). If `returntx` is `true`, the result is the hex-serialized transaction, which must be sent manually using the `sendrawtransaction` command after any necessary signatures are applied.",
