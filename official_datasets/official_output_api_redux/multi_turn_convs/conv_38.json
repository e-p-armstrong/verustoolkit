    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand the `addmergedblock` command in Verus. Can you tell me what it does?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `addmergedblock` command adds a fully prepared block and its header to the current merge mining queue of the Verus daemon. This allows you to add a new block to the merge mining process, which can be useful for various use cases such as adding a new block to a specific chain or replacing an existing block with a more profitable one.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. What happens if adding a block would exceed the available merge mining slots?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf adding a block would exceed the available merge mining slots, the default action is to replace the block with the least ROI (Return on Investment) if the new block provides more ROI. This ensures that the most profitable blocks are prioritized in the merge mining process.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! What are the possible results of the `addmergedblock` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe possible results of the `addmergedblock` command are:\n\n1. \"deserialize-invalid\" - the block could not be deserialized and was rejected as invalid.\n2. \"blocksfull\" - the block did not exceed others in estimated ROI, and there was no room for an additional merge mined block.\n3. {\"nextblocktime\": n} - the block has an invalid time and must be remade with the returned time.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. How can I use the `addmergedblock` command with the Verus CLI?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `addmergedblock` command with the Verus CLI by running a command like this:\n```\nverus addmergedblock \"hexdata\" '{\"currencyid\" : \"hexstring\", \"rpchost\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"rpcport\" : portnum}'\n```\nReplace \"hexdata\" with the hex-encoded block data, and \"hexstring\" with the currency ID. Also, replace \"127.0.0.1\" and \"portnum\" with the actual RPC host and port.",
