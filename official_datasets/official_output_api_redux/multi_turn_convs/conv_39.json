    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand some of the commands in Verus. What is the purpose of the `zcbenchmark` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `zcbenchmark` command is used to run a benchmark of a specific type a certain number of times, and returns the running times of each sample. It's a useful tool for testing and optimizing performance in Verus.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What are the required arguments for the `zcbenchmark` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `zcbenchmark` command requires two arguments: `benchmarktype` and `samplecount`. `benchmarktype` specifies the type of benchmark to run, and `samplecount` specifies how many times to run the benchmark.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. And what is the format of the output from the `zcbenchmark` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe output from the `zcbenchmark` command is a list of objects, where each object contains a single property called `runningtime`, which represents the running time of a single sample. So, you'll get a list of running times, one for each sample you ran.",
