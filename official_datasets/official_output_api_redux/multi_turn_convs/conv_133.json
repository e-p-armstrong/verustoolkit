    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to use Verus for a cross-chain transfer, and I'm not sure what to do after calling `migrate_converttoexport`. Can you help?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter calling `migrate_converttoexport`, you need to fund the transaction using `fundrawtransaction` if necessary, and then sign the transaction using `signrawtransaction`. Finally, you need to pass the finished export transaction and payouts to the `migrate_createimporttransaction` method on a KMD node to get the corresponding import transaction. Make sure you follow these steps carefully to complete the transfer.\n\n**User:**\nThanks for the help! I think I understand what to do now. But I'm still a bit unclear on the relationship between `migrate_converttoexport` and `migrate_createimporttransaction`. Can you explain it to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `migrate_converttoexport` method is used to prepare a transaction for export from one chain, and the `migrate_createimporttransaction` method is used to create a corresponding import transaction on another chain. The output of `migrate_converttoexport` is used as input to `migrate_createimporttransaction` to complete the cross-chain transfer. Think of it as a two-step process: `migrate_converttoexport` prepares the transaction to leave one chain, and `migrate_createimporttransaction` brings it into the other chain. Does that make sense?",
