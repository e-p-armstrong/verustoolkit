Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `calc_MoM` command requires two parameters: `height` and `MoMdepth`. These parameters are necessary to calculate the Momentum (MoM) score, which is an important metric in the Verus ecosystem. Do you have any questions about what these parameters represent or how to use them?",
