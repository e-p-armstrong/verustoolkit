    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `getaddressesbyaccount` command in Verus, but I'm not entirely sure what it does. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getaddressesbyaccount` command returns a list of addresses associated with a specific account in Verus. It's a useful command for managing your Verus accounts and addresses.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But what's the required format for the \"account\" argument in the `getaddressesbyaccount` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"account\" argument must be set to an empty string (`\"\"`) to represent the default account. Passing any other string will result in an error. So, just make sure to use an empty string for the account argument.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! And what about the format of the result returned by the `getaddressesbyaccount` command? What can I expect to see?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result is a JSON array of strings, where each string is a VRSC address associated with the given account. So, you'll get a list of addresses in a JSON format, which should be easy to work with.",
