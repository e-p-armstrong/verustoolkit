    "What do the different values of the `options` parameter mean when defining a currency on Verus?",
    "The `options` parameter determines the type of currency being defined. The possible values are:\n- `1`: Default, a decentralized currency where registration fees are burned.\n- `2`: Centralized currency, where the rootID can mint and burn supply, and subID registration fees go to the rootID.\n- `3`: Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens.",
    "``1`` is default, which launches a decentralized currency (no need to include this parameter when defining such a currency). When subIDs are created with this option, the registration fees are burned.``2`` is for a centralized currency. If it\u2019s a basket currency the rootID can mint and burn supply while automatically lowering and raising the reserve ratio (also anyone can burn supply without lowering the reserve ratio). Or when it\u2019s a simple token currency they can just mint and burn supply. The subID registration fees go to the rootID.``3`` is for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens.

In the case of a simple token currency, combine it with `\"conversions\"` to determine the preconversion price.Use up to 10 currencies for this parameter.",
