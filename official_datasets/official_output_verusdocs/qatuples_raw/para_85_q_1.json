    "What is the purpose of the `timelock` setting when updating a VerusID?",
    "The `timelock` setting specifies the duration for which the VerusID will be locked. During this time, the funds associated with the ID cannot be spent. For example, if you set `timelock` to `1508994`, the ID will be locked for approximately 1 year. After that period, the funds can be spent again.",
    "- Under ``timelock`` you put ``1508994``\n- Under ``name`` you put your VerusID name without ``@``\n- Under ``primaryaddress`` you put the R-address which is the primary address of your VerusID (you can find this address in the 'VerusID'-tab, open your VerusID and click `ID Info')So in our example your VerusID is locked for approximately for 1 year. After that period of time the funds can be spent again.``` json\nrun updateidentity \n'{\n  \"name\":\"youridentityname\",\n  \"minimumsignatures\":1,\n  \"primaryaddresses\":[\"primary-address-comes-here\"],\n  \"flags\":0,\n  \"timelock\":1534360\n}'\n```You can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs. In the code snippet are the minimum requirements to update your VerusID with a lock.:::tip Revoke & Recover\nRemember: you can always revoke and recover a locked VerusID.\n:::## Vault with DelayLock\n![image-delaylock](/images/delaylock.png)\nNow let's put a DelayLock on a VerusID. This means that you lock the identity, and when you request the identity to be unlocked, a predetermined number of blocks have to pass before you can actually spend the funds again.### Set the DelayLock\nLet's say you want to put a Delaylock of 1 week. 1 week is ``10,080`` blocks (1440x7). This will lock the identity, and when you requested an unlock, it takes 1 week (or 10,080 blocks) before the funds can be spent again.- Under ``timelock`` you put ``10080``\n- Under ``name`` you put your VerusID name without ``@``\n- Under ``primaryaddress`` you put the R-address which is the primary address of your VerusID (you can find this address in the 'VerusID'-tab, open your VerusID and click `ID Info')",
