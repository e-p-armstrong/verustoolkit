    "How can I safely stake my funds using a VerusID?",
    "To safely stake your funds using a VerusID, you can use the Vault feature to lock the identity with a delay of 10,080 blocks (~1 week). This way, if someone gains access to the private keys of the locked VerusID, they will have to unlock the identity before they can spend the funds. You will be warned if someone makes an unlock request that isn't you, and the intruder will have to wait 10,080 blocks before they can spend the funds. If you have set up revocation and recovery authorities, you will have one week to safeguard your funds away from prying hands, back into your control.",
