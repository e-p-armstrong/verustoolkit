    "What is the purpose of VDXF's type specification?",
    "The purpose of VDXF's type specification is to enable applications to locate, recognize types of, parse, and decode any form of application or system-specific data.",
    "## Definition of VDXF typesVDXF is not a strongly opinionated or highly specified type description specification, and, instead, focuses on a model for recognizing an unlimited number of user defined data types, using a standard human readable format for definition and encoding of the type specifier, which is hashed, using the VDXF specification and standard methodology, to produce collision-free, 20 byte keys, which can be associated with retrieveable content hashes and location qualifiers that enable applications to locate, recognize types of, parse, and decode any form of application or system specific data. VDXF specifies some basic type formats, as necessary to enable initial applications, but leaves further specifications of applicaiton specific data formats, of which there may be an unlimited number, as an open-ended option for those needing new data type definitions for efficient application development. It is recommended that new fundamental data types not be defined unless necessary, but adherence to such recommendation is not enforced at the consensus protocol layer.## Namespace for Type Definitions - VerusIDNamespaces for type definitions are equivalent to VerusIDs, a protocol first implemented on the Verus Blockchain, and also one that can support IDs registered on any blockchain or uniquely named system that becomes recognized via a consensus-based bridge on the Verus network. Currently, to be recognized as a unique namespace, the easiest way is to base it on a VerusID, registered on the Verus blockchain network.",
