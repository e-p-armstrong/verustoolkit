    "What role do Notary IDs play in the Verus network, and how do they enable interoperability between blockchains?",
    "Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, while also allowing for the creation of private, internal blockchains that can easily bridge public currencies onto an organization's internal network.",
    "## Crowdfunding currency and blockchain launches\nSet required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees.\n\nThe launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n\n## Interoperable, multichain network\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.\n\nNotary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access.\n\nThere is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.",
