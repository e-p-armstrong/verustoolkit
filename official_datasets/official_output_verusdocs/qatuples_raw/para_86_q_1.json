    "If you lock a VerusID, you can always revoke and recover it. Additionally, you can request an unlock by updating the identity with the necessary parameters, such as setting `flags` to 0. After requesting an unlock, you need to wait for the predetermined number of blocks to pass before you can spend the funds again.",
