    "How do I specify the block height when requesting an unlock in Verus?",
    "When requesting an unlock, you can specify the block height under \"unlockatblock\" by filling in the current block height minus 1. Alternatively, you can fill in 0 to immediately request an unlock.",
    "To request an unlock you need to know the blockheight of the blockchain. Under ``unlockatblock`` you can fill in whatever the current blockheight is minus 1. So if the blockheight is at 1,000,000 you can fill in ``999999`` or just ``0`` (recommended) to immediately request an unlock.\n\n``` json\nrun setidentitytimelock \"myid@\" \n'{\n  \"unlockatblock\":0\n}'\n```\n\nYou can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs.",
