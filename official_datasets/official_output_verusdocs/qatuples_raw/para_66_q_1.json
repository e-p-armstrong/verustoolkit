    "What is the purpose of the `exportto` and `exportcurrency` parameters in the `sendcurrency` command when exporting a currency to Ethereum?",
    "The `exportto` parameter specifies that the currency should be exported to Ethereum (as \"veth\"), and the `exportcurrency` parameter indicates that the currency should be exported as an ERC-20 token.",
    "# Export currency to Ethereum (as ERC-20)\n\nAny currency on Verus can be exported to Ethereum as an ERC-20. The currency can then be used in the complete Ethereum ecosystem, and on the Verus network. Sending to and from Verus and Ethereum couldn't be easier. [More on the Verus-Ethereum Bridge.](/eth-bridge/)\n\n::: tip \u2194\ufe0f Verus-Ethereum Bridge \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd27 For Testnet!\n[\ud83d\udc49 Access the Verus-Ethereum Testnet Bridge](https://ethbridge.verustest.net/) (\u26a0\ufe0f Goerli testnet)\n:::\n\n::: tip \u2194\ufe0f Verus-Ethereum Bridge \u2705 For Mainnet!\n[\ud83d\udc49 Access the Verus-Ethereum Mainnet Bridge](https://eth.verusbridge.io)\n:::\n\n### Exporting the currency\nNow, let\u2019s export a currency from Verus to Ethereum as an ERC-20 over the non-custodial bridge. We must have enough funds to pay for the export.\n\nThe command to export a currency to Ethereum as an ERC-20:\n\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"myVerusID@\" '[{\n  \"address\":\"0x85a7dE2278E52327471e174AeeB280cdFdC6A68a\", \n  \"currency\":\"myCurrency\", \n  \"amount\":0, \n  \"exportto\":\"veth\", \n  \"exportcurrency\":true, \n  \"feecurrency\":\"veth\"\n}]'\n```\n\nLet's break the command down with what you can change.\n\n**``myVerusID@``** is the from- and change-address. Can be a VerusID, R-address or i-address. The fee to pay for the export comes from here, and if you paid too much fees the rest will be returned here.\n\n**``address``** You can fill in any ETH-address here, it is actually not important what is here.\n\n**``currency``** is the name of the currency you wish to export as an ERC-20. E.g. `MyCurrency`, `MyCurrency.vETH`.\n\n### Wait for notarization\n\nAfter the bridge has been notarized to the blockheight where you have exported the currency, you can choose it from the token dropdown on the [Bridge website mainnet](https://eth.verusbridge.io) or [Bridge website Goerli testnet](https://ethbridge.verustest.net/)",
