    "What is VerusHash, and what makes it unique?",
    "VerusHash is a hash function specifically designed for the VerusPoP consensus algorithm. It is a CPU-friendly long input hash function that uses the quantum-secure Haraka512 V2 algorithm as its core compression algorithm. VerusHash is unique in that it allows modern CPUs and GPUs to compete on an economically comparable level, making it the fastest known cryptocurrency hash algorithm available.",
    "# Verus Proof of Power\nVerusPoP is a 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.\n[More information on the Verus miner and staker ecosystem](/economy/).## Hybrid Consensus\nVerus Proof of Power, or VerusPoP, is a hybrid consensus algorithm which uses a statistical function that combines Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate each block by either PoW or PoS, while averaging to a target percentage of blocks being validated by each form of proof.In short, it a unique consensus mechanism with 50% of all blocks validated by miners, and the other 50% by stakers.## Attack Resistant\nTo successfully attack the Verus blockchain, more than 50% of the validation power is needed, called ``Chain Power``. A 51% attack would require a combined value of over 50% of both the chain\u2019s hashpower and its coin supply. [For technical information on VerusPoP read the whitepaper](https://verus.io/docs/VerusPoP.pdf).VerusPoP provides a decentralizing effect on the network, incentivizing holders to keep nodes online to support the network. Even if a change in network hashrate happens, the PoW/PoS ratio stays the same: 50/50%.## VerusHash 2.2\n[From the VerusPoP whitepaper](https://verus.io/docs/VerusPoP.pdf):\"VerusHash is specifically developed to deliver a competitive advantage for CPUs with GPUs. It is an exceedingly CPU-friendly long input hash function that uses the quantum-secure, short input Haraka512 V2 as its core compression algorithm. The result is the fastest known cryptocurrency hash algorithm available to modern CPUs and the only hash algorithm which enables today\u2019s CPUs and GPUs to compete on an economically comparable level.",
