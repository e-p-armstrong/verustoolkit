    "What is the Dai Savings Rate, and how does it benefit holders of Dai in the Verus ecosystem?",
    "The Dai Savings Rate is a 5% interest rate (subject to change by MakerDAO) that is earned automatically when holding Dai in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. This benefit is passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH, which means that holders of Dai in the Verus ecosystem, including Bridge.vETH, can earn this interest rate.",
    "| \ud83d\udcc8 Accrued fees       |     Details      |\n| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------- |\n| [**Dai Savings Rate**](https://blog.makerdao.com/an-update-on-the-dai-savings-rate-in-multi-collateral-dai/)| 5% interest (at the time of writing, the rate is subject to change by MakerDAO) is earned automatically when holding Dai in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. Dai in Bridge.vETH and in the complete Verus ecosystem get this savings rate. The DSR is being passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH.|\n| **.vETH subID registrations**| A .vETH subID costs 0.01 vETH worth of Bridge.vETH. When registering the subID the Bridge.vETH is burned, meaning the Bridge.vETH supply decreases. |\n| **Conversion fees**| 50% of the conversion fees go into the reserves of Bridge.vETH: 0.025% when it's a reserve to reserve conversion, 0.0125% when it's a reserve to Bridge.vETH conversion (or vice versa). |\n| **Cross-chain send fees**| A share of the cross-chain send fees go into the reserves of Bridge.vETH. |Bridge.vETH had an initial supply of 100,000. During the preconversion timeframe which lasted 10 days, anyone could add VRSC, ETH, DAI and MKR into its reserves. When the preconversion period ended everyone got their share of the 100,000 Bridge.vETH, distributed by the protocol.The supply of Bridge.vETH is dynamic. The currency gets minted when people convert VRSC, ETH, DAI or MKR to Bridge.vETH, and the currency gets burned when they convert from Bridge.vETH back to VRSC, ETH, DAI or MKR.Converting currencies using Bridge.vETH (or other basket currencies) has many advantages. It is MEV-resistant, has no smart contract risks due to protocol level security and has low fees (max. 0.05%).
