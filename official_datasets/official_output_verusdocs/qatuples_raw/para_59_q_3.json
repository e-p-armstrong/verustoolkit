    "How does the `initialcontributions` parameter work when defining a new currency on Verus?",
    "The `initialcontributions` parameter allows the rootID to contribute some or all of the minimum preconversions directly as part of the currency definition. This can be used to make an initial contribution to either the reserves when it's a basket currency or to the rootID when it's a simple token currency.",
    "There is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting. Take this into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.Example currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"CompanyX\",\n \"options\":32,\n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\n \"conversions\":[2],\n \"minpreconversion\":[500]\n}'\n```\n\u261d\ufe0f This simple token currency is called CompanyX. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert at least 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 250 CompanyX, or more when more is converted. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds back.### **\"maxpreconversion\"**\nUse this parameter to set a maximum amount of preconversions. During the preconversion time frame the amount set can not be exceeded. Everything above this amount will be automatically refunded after the currency is launched.Example currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"CoinCommunity\", \n \"options\":33, \n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"], \n \"maxpreconversion\":[100], \n \"initialsupply\":100\n}'\n```\n\u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called CoinCommunity. During the preconversion time frame people can convert VRSCTEST into its reserves for 100 CoinCommunity in return. During the preconversion time frame there can not be more than 100 VRSCTEST converted into its reserves. Whatever is preconverted more will be returned.### **\"initialcontributions\"**\nThe rootID can contribute some or all of the minimum preconversions directly as part of the currency definition. Use this parameter to make an initial contribution to either the reserves when it\u2019s a basket currency (`options:33`), or to the rootID when it\u2019s a simple token currency (`options:32`).",
