    "How do PBaaS chains relate to the Verus daemon?",
    "All PBaaS chains run from the same Verus daemon. Projects can join the Verus community to improve the daemon, which provides a complete, multi-currency, VerusID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.",
    "All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, VerusID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.## DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets\nAny VerusID owner may define basket currencies, with one or more reserves backing the currency, at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing.The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular basket currency, and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi basket currencies directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.## Bridge converter launches\nLaunch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain.Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other 100% asset backed or partially asset backed basket currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.",
