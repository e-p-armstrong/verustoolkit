    "What is the basic format of a currency definition on Verus, and how is it processed?",
    "A simple currency definition on Verus looks like this:\n```json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"MyBrand\", \n \"options\":32, \n \"proofprotocol\":2, \n \"preallocations\":[{\"Klaus@\":100}]\n}'\n```\nWhen you run this command, it is processed into a HEX, which is then broadcasted to the network. The fees for this transaction are taken from the rootID and distributed among the block producers. After a minimum of 20 blocks, the currency is launched and ready to be used by the worldwide network.",
    "# Launch currencies::: warning Need help setting up a currency launch? \ud83e\udd14\n[Go to the Verus Discord #pbaas-development channel. The community is happy to assist!](https://www.verus.io/discord)\n:::![image-currencies-launching](/images/launching-currencies.png)This is what a (simple) currency definition looks like:``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"MyBrand\", \n \"options\":32, \n \"proofprotocol\":2, \n \"preallocations\":[{\"Klaus@\":100}]\n}'\n```The above command is processed into a HEX, and that HEX is broadcasted to the network. Simultaneously the fees are taken from the rootID (and distributed among the block producers) and after waiting a minimum period of 20 blocks the currency is launched and ready to be used by the worldwide network.## VerusID namespace\nTo launch a currency on Verus (and any other PBaaS-chain) a namespace is needed. That namespace is a VerusID. The namespace is the name of the currency (e.g. ``MyBrand@``). That namespace can also have subIDs (e.g. ``product.MyBrand@``, ``user.MyBrand@``). The controller of this VerusID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.On Verus a VerusID registration costs between 20 and 100 VRSC, and the launch of a currency costs 200 VRSC. These costs are always paid in the chain\u2019s native coin (to the worldwide miners and stakers). On other PBaaS-chains these costs can differ since the chain launcher can define its own costs for VerusID registrations and currency launches.## Defining options\nTo define a currency, choose options. Then combine these options to whatever the currency needs to be. Just add the numbers together in the currency definition. The currency options are listed below.",
