            "Public addresses in Verus are addresses that can be used to send and receive funds, and their transactions are visible on blockchain explorers. There are three types of public addresses: R-addresses, VerusIDs, and i-addresses. R-addresses are derived from a private key, VerusIDs are public friendly-name cryptocurrency addresses controlled by a primary address (which is a R-address), and i-addresses are derived from a VerusID.",
