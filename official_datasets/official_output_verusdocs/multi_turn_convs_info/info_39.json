            "How can I define a basket currency using the command line and Verus, and what are the implications of doing so?",
            "To define a basket currency, you can use the `definecurrency` command with the following format:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"SocialBrand\", \n \"options\":33, \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"], \n \"initialsupply\":500, \n \"preallocations\":[{\"Max@\":1000}]\n}'\n```\nThis creates a basket currency called SocialBrand, where people can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves and receive 500 SocialBrand in return. The `preallocations` parameter allows for a chosen amount of funds to be directed to a specific VerusID (in this case, Max@) after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched.",
            "Example currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"SocialBrand\", \n \"options\":33, \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"], \n \"initialsupply\":500, \n \"preallocations\":[{\"Max@\":1000}]\n}'\n```\n\u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called SocialBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves and in return they get 500 SocialBrand distributed among them. Immediately after launch Max@ receives 1000 SocialBrand, lowering the reserve ratio of the currency.### **\"preallocations\"**\nUse this parameter to receive a chosen amount of funds after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. Funds can be directed to VerusIDs and R-addresses. Works with simple token currencies and basket currencies.When using this parameter with basket currencies, after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, the reserve ratio is lowered. This is because new currency has been minted after the initial supply (`\"initialsupply\"`) is distributed, and nothing was new added into the reserves.::: danger Limit for all currency supplies (10 billion)\n10 billion (minus 1 satoshi) with 8 decimal places (9999999999.99999999) is now the recommended absolute limit for all currency supplies, including over time with conversions and extended tail emissions for blockchains.\n:::### **\"prelaunchcarveout\"**\nOnly works with basket currencies (`options:33`). Use this to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the rootID.\nAfter the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, a percentage of the reserves is taken and redirected to the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio, making the currency more volatile.",
