            "What is the Dai Savings Rate, and how does it benefit holders of Dai in the Verus ecosystem?",
            "The Dai Savings Rate is a 5% interest rate (subject to change by MakerDAO) that is earned automatically when holding Dai in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. This benefit is passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH, which means that holders of Dai in the Verus ecosystem, including Bridge.vETH, can earn this interest rate.",
