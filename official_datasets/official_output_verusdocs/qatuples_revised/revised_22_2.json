    "How does the Verus-Ethereum Bridge protect against malicious notary witnesses or stolen keys?",
    "The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is designed to be secure against malicious notary witnesses or stolen keys. To mount a successful attack on the bridge, a majority of witnesses would need to collude, fake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain would need to be created, and developers would need to create an alternate protocol for the shadow chain. This is a highly unlikely scenario, and the bridge provides a way to defend against it.",
    "Every 10 blocks the block producers create a notarization (when there is traffic over the bridge). They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum. The digital receipts, called \u201cnotarizations\", contain, among other things: the \u201cstateroot\u201d ([Merkle Mountain Range](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp) for Verus, [Merkle Patricia Trie](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/) for Ethereum), the blockheight, blockhash and the gas price for Ethereum. The notarizations have to be agreed to by the block producers (miners and stakers) and are then mined into the Verus blockchain.\ud83d\udc49 [Read more here](https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-internet-protocol-vip-provable-decentralized-cross-chain-communication-8d9414a429c5?source=rss----4869a79d7e7f---4) on how the Verus Protocol handles cross-chain communication (PBaaS-chains and more) in a decentralized and provable way.### Safeguards against bridge hacks\nThreats caused by malicious notary witnesses, or stolen keys to drain funds are not viable against the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. To successfully mount an attack on the bridge, if a majority of witnesses were colluding or got their private keys stolen the following would need to happen:- Colluding, malicious witnesses.\n- Fake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain. [\ud83d\udc49 Verus Paper: A Provable Hybrid Solution to 51% Hash Attacks](https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf)\n- Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow chain.These requirements are very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain. The bridge even provides a way to defend against such an unlikely scenario.",
