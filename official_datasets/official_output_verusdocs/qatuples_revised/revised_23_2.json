    "What happens if the minimum participation levels are not met during a crowdfund launch in Verus?",
    "If the minimum participation levels are not met by the start time of your currency or token, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their preconversions, less the network fees. This ensures that participants are not left with unwanted or unsold tokens or currencies.",
    "## Crowdfund mechanisms\nAll currencies can be launched through decentralized crowdfund mechanisms. [Set required minimum levels](/currencies/launch-currency.html#minpreconversion) of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies. If by the start time of your currency or token, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their preconversions, less the network fees.\n\nThe launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral [pre-allocations](launch-currency.html#preallocations) to select VerusIDs that increase the reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral [carve-outs of proceeds](launch-currency.html#prelaunchcarveout), and [pre-launch discounts](launch-currency.html#prelaunchdiscount) for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n\n#",
