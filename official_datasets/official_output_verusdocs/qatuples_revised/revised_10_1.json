    "How does the fee pool impact the profitability of mining and staking in Verus?",
    "The fee pool is designed to make mining and staking in Verus more profitable. By adding 1% of the fee pool to the block rewards with each new block, the protocol incentivizes miners and stakers to participate in the network, as fees are expected to outnumber block rewards.",
    "## Fee Pool\nAll the fees generated by the protocol are collected in the ``fee pool``. With each new block, ``1%`` of the fee pool is added on top of the block rewards. It is expected that fees outnumber block rewards, making mining and staking in the Verus ecosystem a profitable and competitive endeavor.",
