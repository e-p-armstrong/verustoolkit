    "What is the purpose of the `idregistrationfees` parameter in the `definecurrency` command?",
    "The `idregistrationfees` parameter specifies the fee required to register a subID. This fee is paid in the currency being defined and goes to the rootID.",
    "Example currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"InternetCommunity\", \n \"options\":41, \n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\n \"initialcontributions\":[25],\n \"initialsupply\":5000, \n \"idregistrationfees\":1\n}'\n```\n\u261d\ufe0f The is a basket currency called InternetCommunity with subID referrals enabled. The launcher of the currency wanted to make initial contributions to its reserves. There needs to be 225.0002 VRSCTEST in the rootID at the moment of broadcasting the currency to the network (currency launch fee + initial contributions + txfees). The initial supply of 5000 went to the rootID (if there weren\u2019t any more preconverters). The base fee to register a subID is 1 InternetCommunity.### **\"idreferrallevels\"**\n![image-referralsID](/images/referralsID2.png)\nUse this parameter to change the levels of referrals used when registering subIDs. The image above shows the division and distribution of subID registration fees, depending on the chosen level. Minimum is 0 levels, maximum is 5. The default is `3` levels.To enable referrals, add `\"options\":8` to the currency definition.Example currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"PremiumAccess\", \n \"options\":40, \n \"proofprotocol\":2, \n \"preallocations\":[{\"Klaus@\":2000}],\n \"idregistrationfees\":300,\n \"idreferrallevels\":1\n}'\n```\n\u261d\ufe0f This is a centralized simple token currency called PremiumAccess. The owner of the rootID can mint and burn tokens at will. It has referrals enabled. When the currency is launched 2000 PremiumAccess go to the Klaus@ VerusID. It costs a 300 PremiumAccess fee to register a subID. These fees go to the rootID because it is a centralized token currency. When someone registers a subID using a referral they pay 200 of which 100 goes to the referred subID, and 100 to the rootID.",
