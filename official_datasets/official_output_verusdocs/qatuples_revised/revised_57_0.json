The costs will then be paid in the native coin of the PBaaS-chain.## Friendly Name\nEach VerusID can have an easy to remember name, chosen by the user. It has never been easier to send and receive funds.::: tip Supporting Worldwide Adoption\nAll characters from **all character sets** (except ``/`` ``:`` ``*`` ``?`` ``\"`` ``<`` ``>`` ``|`` ``@`` ``.`` ) are available to create a VerusID.\n:::",
