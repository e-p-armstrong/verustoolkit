    "What is the purpose of notarizations in the Verus-Ethereum Bridge?",
    "The purpose of notarizations is to provide a provable and decentralized way of handling cross-chain communication between Verus and Ethereum. Notarizations serve as digital receipts that contain information about the state of the Verus and Ethereum blockchains, allowing for secure and trustless communication between the two chains.",
    "Every 10 blocks the block producers create a notarization (when there is traffic over the bridge). They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum. The digital receipts, called \u201cnotarizations\", contain, among other things: the \u201cstateroot\u201d ([Merkle Mountain Range](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp) for Verus, [Merkle Patricia Trie](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/) for Ethereum), the blockheight, blockhash and the gas price for Ethereum. The notarizations have to be agreed to by the block producers (miners and stakers) and are then mined into the Verus blockchain.\ud83d\udc49 [Read more here](https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-internet-protocol-vip-provable-decentralized-cross-chain-communication-8d9414a429c5?source=rss----4869a79d7e7f---4) on how the Verus Protocol handles cross-chain communication (PBaaS-chains and more) in a decentralized and provable way.### Safeguards against bridge hacks\nThreats caused by malicious notary witnesses, or stolen keys to drain funds are not viable against the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. To successfully mount an attack on the bridge, if a majority of witnesses were colluding or got their private keys stolen the following would need to happen:- Colluding, malicious witnesses.\n- Fake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain. [\ud83d\udc49 Verus Paper: A Provable Hybrid Solution to 51% Hash Attacks](https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf)\n- Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow chain.These requirements are very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain. The bridge even provides a way to defend against such an unlikely scenario.",
