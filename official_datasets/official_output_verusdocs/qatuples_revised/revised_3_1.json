    "What are the components of a PBaaS blockchain definition in Verus?",
    "When defining a PBaaS blockchain in Verus, the components include:\n\n1. `name`: The name of the chain.\n2. `options`: An integer value, in this case set to 264.\n3. `currencies`: An array of currencies that the chain's native currency can be converted into.\n4. `conversions`: An array defining the conversion ratios between the chain's native currency and each currency on the chain.\n5. `eras`: An array defining the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each \"era\" in the chain's lifecycle.\n6. `notaries`: An array of VerusIDs that will serve as notaries on the chain.\n7. `minnotariesconfirm`: An integer for the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block.\n8. `nodes`: An array describing the network addresses of the nodes on the chain, as well as their IDs.\n9. `gatewayconvertername`: The name of the bridge converter.\n10. `gatewayconverterissuance`: The initial issuance of the bridge converter's native token.\n\nAdditionally, the bridge definition has its own components:\n\n1. `currencies`: An array of currency tickers that the bridge supports (including the native coins of the chains being bridged).\n2. `initialcontributions`: An array specifying the initial liquidity for each currency in the bridge.\n3. `initialsupply`: The initial supply for the bridge's native token.",
