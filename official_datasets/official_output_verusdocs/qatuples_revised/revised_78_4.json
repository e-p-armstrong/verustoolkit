    "What happens during the deserialization process of a VDXF object?",
    "During the deserialization process, the byte stream is converted back into structured data according to the VDXF format specification. This involves reading the byte stream, extracting and decoding the VDXF key, version, and data components, and reconstructing the original structured data.",
    "- **VDXF Key**: A unique, 20 byte identifier for the VDXF object, that can be represented as a human readable string. This key is essential for identifying the type of data the VDXF object represents.\n- **Version**: Indicates the version of the VDXF object.\n- **Data**: The actual content stored within the VDXF object. This can be any form of data, structured or unstructured, that needs to be serialized.\n\n### Serialization Process\n\n![image-verusid-login](/images/vdxf-bytes.svg)\n\nThe serialization process involves converting the structured data within the VDXF object into a byte stream. This includes encoding the VDXF key, version, and actual data into bytes.\n\n#### Components Encoding\n\n- **VDXF Key**: 20 byte fixed length slice encoded using Base58Check\n- **Version**: Serialized using variable integer encoding to optimize space. The version ensures that the serialized data can be correctly interpreted by systems aware of different versioning.\n- **Data**: The actual data is serialized into a byte buffer. The format and encoding of this data can vary widely depending on the type of data being serialized and the intended use case.\n\n### Deserialization Process\n\nDeserialization is the reverse of serialization, where the byte stream is converted back into structured data according to the VDXF format specification. This process involves reading the byte stream, extracting and decoding the VDXF key, version, and data components, and reconstructing the original structured data.\n\n::: tip VDXF in Action\nLearn how the CHIPS project (decentralized poker) uses [VerusID](https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/blob/verus_test/docs/verus_migration/id_creation_process.md) and [VDXF](https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/blob/verus_test/docs/verus_migration/ids_keys_data.md)",
