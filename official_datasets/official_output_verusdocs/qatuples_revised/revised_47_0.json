    "What is a basket currency in Verus, and how is it created?",
    "A basket currency in Verus is a type of currency that allows people to preconvert other currencies (like VRSCTEST) into its reserves in return for the new currency. It's created using the `definecurrency` command with specific options, such as `options:33`, which specifies that it's a basket currency. The `currencies` option defines the currencies that can be preconverted, and the `initialsupply` option sets the total amount of the new currency that will be distributed.",
    "Example currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"BusinessBrand\", \n \"options\":33, \n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"], \n \"initialsupply\":100, \n \"prelaunchcarveout\":0.1\n}'\n```\n\u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called BusinessBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 BusinessBrand distributed among them. When the currency is launched, 10% VRSCTEST is taken out of the reserves, into the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio by 10%.### **\"prelaunchdiscount\"**\nOnly works with basket currencies (`options:33`). Use this to give people a discount during the preconversion time frame. After the preconversion time frame and the currency is launched, the conversion price will be higher, depending on what percentage the discount was.When using this parameter, after the currency is launched, the reserve ratio will be lowered by the discounted percentage.Example currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"DiscountBrand\", \n \"options\":33, \n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"], \n \"initialsupply\":100, \n \"prelaunchdiscount\":0.5\n}'\n```\n\u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called DiscountBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 DiscountBrand distributed among them. Immediately after the launch of the currency, when people want to convert, the price is 50% higher. Also, the reserve ratio is 50% lower because of the prelaunchdiscount.### **\"weights\"**\nOnly works with basket currencies (`options:33`). Use this to change the respective weights of the reserves in a basket currency. The total of all weights must equal 1. With a minimum of 0.1, since there can\u2019t be more than 10 reserve currencies in a basket currency.",
