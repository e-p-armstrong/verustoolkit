    "# Claim refunds on the Verus-Ethereum Bridge\nCrossing the bridge costs Ethereum gas fees. Gas fees can swing in price quite dramatically in a short period of time. It can happen that when you pay for a bridge crossing the gas fees jumped up higher than what you paid for the crossing, resulting in a refund. Learn here how you can claim your refunds back.\n\n## Ethereum to Ethereum\nWhen using the Bridge website and making a conversion that goes from Ethereum to Verus and back to Ethereum, you have signed a message that created a refund address based on your Ethereum wallet's private key.\n\nThese are the steps to claim refunds when you did an Ethereum to Ethereum transaction:\n\n### Verus Mobile\n1. Export your Ethereum private key from the wallet you did the conversion with (probably MetaMask)\n2. Import that private key into a Verus wallet. The easiest way to do that is with Verus Mobile. \n- Download Verus Mobile on the Play Store or App Store\n- Add a new profile (choose username and password)\n- Choose \"import wallet\"\n- Choose \"Enter key/seed\"\n- Enter the Ethereum private key here\n- Add the currency you want to get back (click the plus-button corner-right, \"Add PBaaS currency\" and choose the one for you)\n\n### Verus Desktop\nIf you are running native mode (full node) Verus Desktop then you can import the Ethereum's private key in this way:\n\nGo to ``Settings (gear-icon top right)``, then ``Coin Settings``, then select the Verus blockchain and type the following:\n\n```json\nrun importprivkey \"ETH_PRIVATE_KEY\" \"\" true\n```\n\n::: warning Important!\nVerus Desktop will not show any progress on the import. It will take some time for the process to finish in the background.\n:::\n\n## Verus to Ethereum\nWhen bridging with Verus Desktop from the Verus blockchain to the Ethereum blockchain you had to fill in a refund address.\n\nOn the Bridge website you can use that refund address to claim the funds back.",
