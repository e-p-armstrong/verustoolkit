    "What are SubIDs, and how do they relate to VerusIDs?",
    "SubIDs are a type of ID that can be registered under each launched currency and token. They have the same features as VerusIDs, but they cannot launch blockchains, currencies, or tokens. SubIDs provide a way to create a hierarchical structure of IDs, with VerusIDs at the top level and SubIDs beneath them.",
    "les, hashes and messages. | \n| **Multisig** | Multiple organizations or people can manage a VerusID. | \n| **Messages** | Send and receive completely private messages through VerusID private addresses. | \n| [**SSID login**](/verusid/login/) | Login to supported VerusID services without ever needing a password. |\n| **SubID** | Under each launched currency and token subIDs can be registered. SubIDs have the exact same features as VerusIDs, although they can not launch blockchains, currencies or tokens. |",
