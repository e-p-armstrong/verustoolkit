    "What are the different conversion types in Verus DeFi, and what are their respective fees?",
    "There are two conversion types in Verus DeFi: Basket currency \u2194\ufe0f reserve and Reserve \u2194\ufe0f reserve. The fees for these conversions are 0.025% and 0.05%, respectively. The fees are distributed between adding to the reserves of the basket currency and the block reward for miners and stakers.",
    "# Introduction\nVerus DeFi is incredibly simple, low-cost, MEV-resistant and without any middleman. You can convert into a currency that has reserves (you are now \"providing liquidity\"), and you can convert out of the currency again, back into its reserves. Furthermore you can convert from reserve to reserve.

Every participant gets the same, fair conversion rate in one or more blocks. | \n| \u2705 **Protocol level security** | All DeFi operations take place on the consensus layer of the protocol, and are verified by miners and stakers. There is no smart contract risk. | \n| \u2705 **Low fees** | Protocol conversion fees are as low as 0.025%, or as high as 0.05%. |Two conversion types:| Conversion type | Fee | Fee goes to |\n| :-----| :------ | :-------- |\n| Basket currency \u2194\ufe0f reserve | 0.025% | 0.0125% added to reserves of the basket currency, 0.0125% to the block reward for miners and stakers | \n| Reserve \u2194\ufe0f reserve | 0.05% | 0.025% added to reserves of the basket currency, 0.025% to the block reward for miners and stakers |## L1 DeFi\nVerus is a ``UTXO-based`` blockchain with ``smart transactions``. All smart capabilities are implemented on the protocol level. This has many advantages over blockchain projects that use layer two solutions. [Read \"Smart Transactions vs. Smart Contracts\"](https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-smart-transactions-vs-smart-contracts-f98079c00ed0)Advantages of DeFi at the protocol level:* Increased security at the application level - Verus DeFi is not implemented by having many smart contract authors creating smart contracts on top of the protocol, so there can be no exploits by searching for unintended \"cracks\" in the seams between contracts.",
