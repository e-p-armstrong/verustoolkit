    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have some questions about VerusIDs. When creating a VerusID, what is the purpose of assigning a RevokeID and a RecoveryID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen creating a VerusID, users can assign a RevokeID and a RecoveryID to their VerusID. These assigned identities are also VerusIDs and can be used to control the VerusID's funds. The RevokeID can be used to revoke the VerusID, effectively freezing its funds, while the RecoveryID can be used to recover the VerusID and restore access to its funds.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What happens when a VerusID is revoked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a VerusID is revoked, its funds can no longer be spent. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to the VerusID's funds.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about recovery? What happens when a VerusID is recovered?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a VerusID is recovered, all of its assets are restored to a new address, and the funds and UTXOs can be spent again.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about the Verus Vault. What is it, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Vault is a unique feature that allows users to add an extra layer of security to their VerusID. It allows users to set locks or timelocks on their VerusID, which prevents funds from being spent until the lock or timelock is removed. There are three stages to the Vault: locked until a predetermined number of blocks have passed, locked with a delay, and unlocked. Even when a VerusID is locked or timelocked, it can still receive, hold, and stake funds, and can still be used for signing.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really cool. But I have one more question. Can a locked or timelocked VerusID still be revoked and recovered?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, even when a VerusID is locked or timelocked, it can still be revoked and recovered. The Vault adds an extra layer of security, but it doesn't restrict the ability to revoke or recover the VerusID.",
