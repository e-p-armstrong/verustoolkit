    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey there, I've been playing around with Verus Desktop and I noticed something called Verus Vault. What is it, and what can I do with it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature in Verus Desktop that allows you to lock funds in your VerusID. When funds are locked in the Vault, they cannot be spent anymore and are restricted to the VerusID. However, you can still stake and receive coins. There are two types of locks: TimeLock and DelayLock. Would you like to know more about those?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that sounds interesting. What are the two types of locks available in Verus Vault, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe two types of locks available in Verus Vault are TimeLock and DelayLock. A TimeLock locks the funds and unlocks them until a predetermined number of blocks have passed. A DelayLock locks the funds and unlocks them with a delay, requiring an unlock request and a predetermined number of blocks to pass before the funds can be spent again. Do you have a specific use case in mind for these locks, or would you like to know more about how to set them up?\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand the concepts. How can I set up a TimeLock on a VerusID using Verus Desktop?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo set up a TimeLock on a VerusID using Verus Desktop, you need to access the command-line interface in Verus Desktop. Go to \"Settings\" (the cogwheel top right corner), then select \"Coin Settings\". Here, you can fill in the commands to set up your Vault. For a TimeLock, you need to know the block height of the blockchain and specify the number of blocks you want to lock your VerusID for. Have you tried setting up a TimeLock before, or would you like more guidance on the process?\n\n**User:**\nI think I can handle the setup. But before I do, are there any considerations I should keep in mind when locking funds for a long period of time using Verus Vault?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen locking funds for a long period of time using Verus Vault, it's best to take an average block time of 62 seconds into account. Additionally, you should be aware that there are variables that make it difficult to predict an exact time, such as leap years. Over the long term, there are an average of 1394.5484 blocks per day. It's essential to plan carefully and consider these factors to ensure you're locking your funds for the desired amount of time.",
