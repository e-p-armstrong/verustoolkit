    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to learn more about VerusID. What are some of the key features of VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusID has several key features, including multisig capabilities, private messaging, SSID login, and SubID registration. These features provide a robust and flexible digital identity system. Do you have any specific questions about these features or would you like me to explain them in more detail?\n\n**User:**\nThat's a great start! I'd love to know more about multisig. What is the purpose of multisig in VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMultisig in VerusID allows multiple organizations or people to manage a single VerusID, providing a way for multiple parties to jointly control and manage a digital identity. This feature is particularly useful for organizations or groups that require multiple sign-offs or approvals for certain actions. Would you like me to explain more about how multisig works in VerusID?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I'm also curious about SubIDs. What are SubIDs, and how do they relate to VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSubIDs are a type of ID that can be registered under each launched currency and token. They have the same features as VerusIDs, but they cannot launch blockchains, currencies, or tokens. SubIDs provide a way to create a hierarchical structure of IDs, with VerusIDs at the top level and SubIDs beneath them. This hierarchical structure allows for a more organized and scalable digital identity system. Do you have any more questions about SubIDs or their relationship with VerusIDs?",
