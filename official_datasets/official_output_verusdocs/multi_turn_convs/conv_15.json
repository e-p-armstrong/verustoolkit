    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the Verus-Ethereum Bridge, and I'm not entirely sure what a notarization is in this context. Can you explain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the context of the Verus-Ethereum Bridge, a notarization is a digital receipt created by block producers (miners and stakers) every 10 blocks when there is traffic over the bridge. This digital receipt contains information such as the stateroot, blockheight, blockhash, and gas price for Ethereum, and is agreed upon by the block producers before being mined into the Verus blockchain.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. But what is the purpose of these notarizations in the Verus-Ethereum Bridge?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe purpose of notarizations is to provide a provable and decentralized way of handling cross-chain communication between Verus and Ethereum. Notarizations serve as digital receipts that contain information about the state of the Verus and Ethereum blockchains, allowing for secure and trustless communication between the two chains.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But what about security? How does the Verus-Ethereum Bridge protect against malicious notary witnesses or stolen keys?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus-Ethereum Bridge is designed to be secure against malicious notary witnesses or stolen keys. To mount a successful attack on the bridge, a majority of witnesses would need to collude, fake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain would need to be created, and developers would need to create an alternate protocol for the shadow chain. This is a highly unlikely scenario, and the bridge provides a way to defend against it.",
