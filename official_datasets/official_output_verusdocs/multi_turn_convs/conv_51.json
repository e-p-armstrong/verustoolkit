    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to learn more about creating currencies on Verus. I came across the \"nativecurrencyid\" parameter in a currency definition. What is it used for, and what does it include?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"nativecurrencyid\" parameter is used for mapped ERC-20 tokens, and it includes the Ethereum contract address for the ERC-20 token. This allows for easy integration with existing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Do you have any more questions about creating currencies on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nBefore I start creating a currency, I want to make sure I do it right. What should I do before launching a currency or token on Verus or any other PBaaS-chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt is highly recommended to try out the currency or token on the Verus Testnet first before launching it on the mainnet. This will allow you to test and refine your currency definition without risking any real assets. It's always a good idea to test before going live!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! Now, how do I launch a currency using a currency definition with the command-line interface?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a currency, you need to use the `definecurrency` command with your currency definition, which will give you a HEX value as output. Then, you need to use the `sendrawtransaction` command with the HEX value to launch the currency. This will broadcast your currency definition to the network and start the launch process.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens after I launch a currency, and how long does it take for the currency to be fully launched?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter launching a currency, the funds from the rootID are taken, and it takes a minimum of 20 blocks (or startblock) for the currency to be fully launched, if all preconversion goals are met. This allows the network to validate and confirm the launch of your new currency.\n\n**User:**\nAfter the currency is launched, how can I lookup information about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrency` command with the currency name to lookup information about a currency after it has been launched. This will give you details about the currency, such as its current status, parameters, and other relevant information.",
