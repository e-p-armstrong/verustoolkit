    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into Verus and I'm curious about staking. What is staking, and how can I participate in it on the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nStaking is a way to secure the Verus network by using your Verus holdings. Anyone can participate in staking, regardless of the amount of Verus coins they hold. In Verus, staking is done with UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs), and a larger UTXO has a higher chance of winning a block. This is a great way to contribute to the security of the network and earn some rewards in the process. Do you have any further questions about staking on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've heard of solo staking and pool staking, what's the difference between them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSolo staking involves staking with your own wallet and node, where you either win a full block or nothing. Pool staking, on the other hand, involves joining a pool of stakeholders, where the rewards are shared among the pool members. There are two types of pool staking: non-custodial staking pools, where you keep control of your funds, and custodial staking pools, where you trust a pool operator with your funds. So, it really depends on your personal preference and risk tolerance.\n\n**User:**\nI think I'll try solo staking. What are the rules to start solo staking on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo start solo staking on Verus, you need to:\n\n1. Have your wallet running\n2. Run a full node (native mode in Verus Desktop)\n3. Enable staking\n4. Have a UTXO that is eligible for staking after 150 blocks\n5. Have a minimum of 0.00000001 VRSC in your wallet\n\nMake sure you follow these steps and you'll be set up for solo staking on Verus. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
