            "Verus envisions a future where every project, chain, and currency on the PBaaS network, as well as ERC20 and ERC721 tokens on Ethereum, can seamlessly integrate with each other, enabling the creation of faster, better, and more secure apps and services. This integration will allow for provable identity, privacy, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts, all accessible through user-friendly interfaces that don't require business deals, permission, or centralized infrastructure.",

            "The core capabilities of Verus include the Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) and VerusID Content Multimaps. The VIP protocol is a fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology that enables secure and private communication between different chains and networks.
