            "Why are decentralization and security closely related in the context of blockchain?",
            "Decentralization and security are closely related because a truly decentralized protocol, with many validators and open access, is more secure due to the difficulty of launching a 51% attack. If a blockchain is less decentralized, with fewer validators or permissioned access, it becomes more vulnerable to 51% attacks, which can compromise the integrity of transactions and undermine the goal of censorship-resistance.",
