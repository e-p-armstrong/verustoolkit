            "What is the purpose of StakeGuard in Verus, and how does it work?",
            "StakeGuard is a Crypto-Condition (CC) technology developed by Verus to solve the nothing-at-stake problem. It works in conjunction with a modified signing script when staking and spending rewards. StakeGuard processes every Staking Transaction and enables legitimate Stake Reward spends to be claimed by the staker. It also catches and penalizes cheated spends, allowing the cheat catcher to claim the reward.",
            "ies. Verus has enhanced the original Crypto-Condition (CC) technology to make integration with standard transactions easier and enable advanced blockchain-level logic.\nThe first CC Verus has developed on-chain is StakeGuard, the Verus nothing-at-stake solution. StakeGuard works in conjunction with a newly modified signing script when staking and spending a reward. StakeGuard is where every Staking Transaction is processed. Legitimate Stake Reward spends are claimed by the staker. Cheated spends, proven to be cheats, are claimed by the cheat catcher (see below).\nIn later releases, the same technology will enable PBaaS, voting, identity capabilities, and more.\nCatching Cheaters\nStakeGuard, which supports the nothing at stake solution, includes the functions of catching cheaters in this version of Verus. Stake Guard enables every miner or staker to catch and spend block rewards associated with stake cheating (when someone stakes two blocks with the same coins on two or more forks).\nWith this early version of Stake Guard, all known orphaned stake transactions are compared to successful stakes when they mature. If the orphan was trying to stake the exact same coins but on a different fork and the real fork at the same time, the miner of the block at maturity of the cheat attempt (100 blocks after the cheat was made) will spend the cheaters one valid reward from the cheat attempt (the reward on the main chain), sending it to a sapling z-addr the miner or staker has set in their wallet. In other words, if, as a miner or staker, your wallet catches and spends such a cheat transaction, the reward for that coinbase will be automatically shielded to your sapling z-address at the same time as you win the block.\nThis early version of Stake Guard does not broadcast cheating transactions and it will not catch all possible cheats on the network. Future versions will excel at catching",

            "How does StakeGuard catch cheaters in the current version of Verus?",
            "In the current version of Verus, StakeGuard catches cheaters by comparing orphaned stake transactions to successful stakes when they mature. If an orphaned transaction is found to be a cheat attempt (i.e., staking the same coins on a different fork), the miner of the block at maturity of the cheat attempt can spend the cheater's reward, sending it to a sapling z-addr set in their wallet.",
