            "Some common challenges that decentralized project creators face when launching their own blockchain include ensuring enough miners to prevent attacks, achieving double spend protection, finding suitable service providers, managing coin economics, and securing liquidity.",
            "ain? How will I make sure I get enough miners so I won\u2019t get attacked? Double spend protection? Can I use existing platforms for this? Get into business with service providers to make all this happen? How about coin economics?\nOkay, cool, I got my chain running. Now, how about liquidity? It costs huge amounts of money to get listed on decent exchanges. I\u2019d rather spend that money on developing an actual product. Maybe smaller exchanges are happy to list your coin for a modest amount, or even for free. But now I might put my userbase at risk, needing to trust small exchanges with security risks. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time less known exchanges are attacked, and it sure as hell won\u2019t be the last.\nThese are all just some examples of the many considerations one has to make before getting a crypto project started. It\u2019s a lot. How glorious would it be if there is a platform that addresses all of these questions for you in a simple, elegant way? And the most critical requirement: it is trustless.\nVerus Got You Covered\nGetting your project started through the Verus platform will be a breeze. With just a few clicks you could be on your way, saving yourself a whole lot of brain energy best spent elsewhere: on the development of your product.

All the funds from your Kickstarter-launch will go into the liquidity pool. Choose what percentage",

            "How can I ensure the liquidity of my coin without spending a lot of money on getting listed on decent exchanges?",
            "Instead of spending a lot on getting listed on major exchanges, you can consider listing on smaller exchanges for a modest amount or even for free. However, this may come with security risks, as smaller exchanges may be more vulnerable to attacks. Alternatively, you can use a platform like Verus that provides instant liquidity and a secure blockchain in a decentralized, trustless way.",
