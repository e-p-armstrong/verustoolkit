            "How do influencers benefit from creating their own social tokens using Verus?",
            "Influencers can benefit from creating their own social tokens using Verus by capturing the value created by their fans and speculators. When fans acquire the tokens by converting their currency, the value of the token increases. As fans spend the tokens on digital goods, the supply of the token decreases, driving up its value. The influencer can then sell their \"premine\" or issue new tokens, capturing the created value without crashing the token's value.",
            "e\u201d tokens to themself as part of the creation process (a \u201cpremine\u201d), or retain the right to issue new tokens at will (perhaps only after the passing of a period of time). They would also need to \u201cseed\u201d the token with a little bit of real world money to provide initial value to the token. Note that this seed money would never actually be at risk of loss, and could always be recovered; in fact, recovery (and more) would be quite easy in the case of thriving token economies. Once this is done, then fans could acquire the tokens (directly, without an AMM) by converting their currency, like USDC, into the social token. Every time a fan does this, they increase the supply of the token a little bit, and they also drive up its value. When they spend the token on digital goods (like ID creation, buying a NFT, getting a membership, etc.) the amount that they spend gets burned from the supply of the token, which reduces its supply and further drives up its value. During this process, too, the robustness of the reserves of \u201creal\u201d currency are improved, providing more depth and stability to the token\u2019s value. It will become easier and easier for the issuer to start selling down their \u201cpremine\u201d, or to issue themself new tokens, and thus capturing the created value, without crashing the value of the token.\nWith this model, further value enhancement might come from speculators who see that an influencer is growing in power. Speculators like these would be analogous to collectors who have an eye for talent, and that can spot trends. All they need to do to profit is to get in early on the right tokens by the right influencers with the right potential economic activity that would *inevitably* drive value increases. In this way, market dynamics might allow influencers to capture future value today.\nThis Exists Today \u2014 the Verus Project\nThis is not just theory, but is about to be put into",
