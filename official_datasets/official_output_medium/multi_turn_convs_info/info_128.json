            "What are Verus fractional reserve currencies, and how do they relate to Verus PBaaS chains?",
            "Verus fractional reserve currencies are the native currencies of Verus PBaaS chains that share liquidity across the Verus ecosystem. These currencies are backed by a certain amount of Verus Coin on the Verus blockchain, which serves as the reserve for the PBaaS chain. The reserves can represent a percentage of the total market cap of a PBaaS blockchain, such as 100%, 50%, or 10%.",
