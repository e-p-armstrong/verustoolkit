            "To enable staking in Verus using the mining dashboard, you can click on Verus on the left side of the dashboard, then toggle staking on in the main interface. This should get you staking, and you'll see a dashboard showing estimates for potential staking returns based on current network conditions.",

            "What does the staking returns calculator in the mining dashboard show, and how accurate is it?",
            "The staking returns calculator in the mining dashboard shows estimates for potential staking returns based on current network conditions. However, it's only an estimate, as the system is based on statistical averages over time and depends on changing network conditions.
