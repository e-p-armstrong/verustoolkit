            "What happened to the Verus Community Discord Server, and what is the current solution?",
            "The Verus Community Discord Server was hacked, and as a result, the community had to create a new Discord Server to ensure the security of its members. The new server has been hardened to prevent similar attacks in the future. The community is still open to discussing security improvements with Discord, but in the meantime, they have taken independent measures to secure their new server.",
            " we still haven\u2019t found a more suitable engagement platform for the way the community works, a number of people have worked to create and secure a new community Discord Server, and we welcome all Verus Community members and well meaning interested people to join.\nThough we are still hoping to have a conversation with Discord about the hack and how they could improve their security to prevent this for all of their user communities in the future, we have taken steps independently to harden the Verus Discord community in a way that would prevent such an attack in the future, even if the link click session hijack exploit is not resolved. We also have even better security thoughts for the future around leveraging VerusID in easy, meaningful ways.
