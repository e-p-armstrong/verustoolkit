            "What makes Verus unique in terms of its launch?",
            "Verus had a fair launch, meaning there was no Initial Coin Offering (ICO), pre-mine, or founder and developer fees. This sets it apart from other blockchain projects.",
            "On May 21st, 2018, one lucky miner in the world somewhere mined the first VerusCoin to ever exist. Since then a vastly growing number of people have discovered the Verus Project. They are forming a lively and thriving community that has been participating in the network through mining and staking the coin, and are also contributing to its growth.\nVerus has come a long way since more than two years ago. We are proud to share our achievements with you. In this article, you will reach a better understanding of some of the technology that has been built and what makes Verus unique and, in our opinion, superior:\nFair Launch: No ICO, pre-mine or founder and developer fees.\nVerusHash 2.2: The hashing algorithm that was developed to lower mining barriers for everyone and create a naturally decentralized network.\nVerus Proof of Power (VerusPoP): 50% PoS, 50% PoW, a provable hybrid solution to 51% hash attacks.\nVerusID: Arguably the most advanced self-sovereign, decentralized identities; they are revocable and recoverable identities on the blockchain, packed with features and capabilities for everyone to use.\nPublic Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS): Launch your own blockchain with customizable specifications, while using Verus infrastructure for security and continuity. PBaaS provides a roadmap for practically unlimited scalability.\nMulti-Reserve Currencies: Just one part of the Verus token/currency functionality, multi-reserve currencies are the foundation for a user-centric DeFi.\nValue for Miners & Stakers: Verus architecture provides rewards to miners and stakers, an entire economy that leads to a robust, strong and permanent infrastructure.",

            "Verus uses a provable hybrid solution called Verus Proof of Power (VerusPoP), which combines 50% Proof of Stake (PoS) and 50% Proof of Work (PoW). This hybrid approach makes Verus more resistant to 51% hash attacks.",
