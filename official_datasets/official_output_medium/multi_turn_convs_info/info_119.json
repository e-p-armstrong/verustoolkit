            "What is the difference between public and private keys in cryptocurrency?",
            "In cryptocurrency, public and private keys are used to create addresses. A public key is derived from a string of numbers and letters and is used to deposit funds. It doesn't have to be kept secret because it can't be used for withdrawals. On the other hand, a private key has the power to spend and must be kept secret, as anyone who knows a corresponding private key can withdraw the funds.",
