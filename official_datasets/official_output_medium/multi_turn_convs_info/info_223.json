            "What is Verus' technical philosophy, and how does it approach building a foundation for decentralized applications?",
            "Verus' technical philosophy is to build additional blockchain primitives into the consensus protocol to provide a robust, secure, and scalable foundation for global-scale distributed and decentralized applications. This approach is based on the idea that the decentralized internet will consist of heterogeneous systems exchanging data that they can all understand, rather than a single \"global computer\" running all applications.",

            "What is Bell's Law, and how does it relate to the current state of the computing paradigm?",
            "Bell's Law states that every decade, a new, lower-priced computer class forms based on a new programming platform, network, and interface, resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new industry. This shift often happens invisibly at first and is only widely understood and recognized five to seven years after it began. Currently, we are in the midst of such a transformation, but there is still little agreement on its specific nature.",

            "What are some of the limitations and problems with the current computing paradigm, and how does Verus aim to address them?",
            "The current computing paradigm has led to giant internet monopolies that abuse their power, stifle freedom, innovation, and wealth creation, and are plagued by constant security breaches and a lack of privacy. Verus aims to address these issues by building a more secure, decentralized, and scalable foundation for applications, allowing for a greater degree of freedom, innovation, and control over personal data.",
