            "The advantage of using fractional currencies in Verus DeFi protocols is that they do not need to be 100% backed by their underlying reserve basket. This allows for seamless liquidity to and from the basket currencies, earning fees between them, and providing investment value that may far exceed the value of the currencies held in reserve.",
