            "Verus uses three different proof models for cross-chain operations: decentralized consensus-achieved, witness-enhanced, cross-chain cryptographic proofs (auto-notarization); decentralized consensus-achieved, witness-dependent, cross-chain cryptographic proofs (notary-dependent notarization); and semi-centralized or centrally controlled gateway proofs. These proof models are configurable on a per-system/chain basis, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in different use cases.",
