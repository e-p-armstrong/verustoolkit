            "How secure is Verus's hybrid algorithm against 51% hash attacks, and what would be required to mount a successful attack?",
            "Verus's hybrid algorithm, which combines proof of work and proof of stake, is highly resistant to 51% hash attacks. To mount a successful attack, an attacker would need to control more than 51% of the network hash power and/or a significant portion of the Verus coin supply.",

The more someone knows about you, the more power they can have over you.
