            "What is the current state of social tokens in the decentralized blockchain world?",
            "The current state of social tokens is limited and inaccessible to many creators. Leading social token platforms, Roll and Rally, require a detailed application process and approval before creators can issue their own social tokens. This process can be time-consuming and favors creators with existing large communities and transaction activity. Additionally, creators who want to issue social tokens independently face a complex and limiting process that requires significant development expertise.",

In return, they take a portion of the creator's token (Roll) or attempt to create value in their own token and sidechain (Rally).",

            "Current social token platforms are limited in that they require creators to have significant development expertise, a large existing community, and transaction activity. They also offer limited flexibility and innovation, as creators are tied to the platform's rules and requirements.
