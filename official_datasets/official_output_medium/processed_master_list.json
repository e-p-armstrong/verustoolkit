Doing that meant committing to some additional development time, but we believe in the power of this system to help society, and it is more important to get it right than have it deployed a few weeks earlier.\nPersonally, I predict that ease of use won\u2019t be the only reason cross-chain conversions will be popular.\nAll buys and sells in any given block will get the exact same conversion price with no spread and all conversion fees will be a flat 0.05%, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers on the Verus and PBaaS blockchains, which of course can all be merge-mined together. This 0.05% both incentivizes miners and stakers to follow the new protocol as intended, and allows fill-or-kill order types that eliminate the risk of front-running. Even at that incredibly small rate, it also provides huge opportunity for decentralized mining and staking profit to anyone who helps validate the Verus PBaaS ecosystem. In one very powerful sense, the Verus reserve ecosystem will have no need for and no overhead imposed by money changers, a virtue that is going to be more and more important as it grows.\nTo conclude, I wanted to provide a general update on development progress that I know about and a more in-depth update on some of the exciting technologies we\u2019re planning to deploy soon on testnet, followed shortly ", "./raw_text_input_medium/Verus Public Blockchains as a Service_ Fractional Reserve Currencies-2019-07-27 01:15:09"]]], [["User:: Hi, I'm interested in learning about Verus's scalability features.

When a user wishes to convert from one token to another, they can conduct two successive transactions, first entering the \u201cpool\u201d by acquiring the multi-reserve currency, then, in the subsequent block, exiting the \u201cpool\u201d to the target currency. Or, they can elect to convert directly from reserve to reserve using a single \u201cvia\u201d transaction, through the \u201cpool\u201d. These conversion transactions are accomplished by simple \u201csending\u201d transactions, as easily as one would typically send a single cryptocurrency. Prices do not need to be selected as the user will be able to observe the price from the last block, understand the typical changes from block to block, and transact at the \u201cmarket\u201d price. The market price is the same fair, solved price for all users who transact in a block.\nReduced Costs and Risks for Liquidity Providers\nThe Verus system drives the marginal cost for provision of liquidity to zero, with the exception of the phenomenon known as \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d. There are no smart contracts to audit \u2014 no unintended scenarios for poorly written contracts that will lead to catastrophic loss. Impermanent loss is dealt with through a fee of 0.025% that is paid to the \u201cpool\u201d holders by every conversion that goes directly from \u201creserve\u201d to \u201creserve\u201d.

They would also need to \u201cseed\u201d the token with a little bit of real world money to provide initial value to the token. Note that this seed money would never actually be at risk of loss, and could always be recovered; in fact, recovery (and more) would be quite easy in the case of thriving token economies. Once this is done, then fans could acquire the tokens (directly, without an AMM) by converting their currency, like USDC, into the social token. Every time a fan does this, they increase the supply of the token a little bit, and they also drive up its value. When they spend the token on digital goods (like ID creation, buying a NFT, getting a membership, etc.) the amount that they spend gets burned from the supply of the token, which reduces its supply and further drives up its value. During this process, too, the robustness of the reserves of \u201creal\u201d currency are improved, providing more depth and stability to the token\u2019s value. It will become easier and easier for the issuer to start selling down their \u201cpremine\u201d, or to issue themself new tokens, and thus capturing the created value, without crashing the value of the token.\nWith this model, further value enhancement might come from speculators who see that an influencer is growing in power.

This means that there's no need to extract rent or payment from users to pay back investors, making it rent-free technology.

You can read more about it here.\nAnd of course, a simple token currency can be one of the reserves in a basket currency.\nWhat are SubIDs\nSubIDs are powerful objects on the blockchain. They can be registered in an unlimited amount under any created currency (basket and simple token currency). A few examples are product.MyBrand@ or user.MyBrand@. The name MyBrand@ is a VerusID (a namespace) that is converted into a currency. The subIDs are \u2018product\u2019 and \u2018user\u2019.\nSubIDs can be bound digitally to many things. They can be bound to people and products. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private.

Coupled with Verus\u2019 multi-chain capabilities and easy creation of independent blockchains, new currencies, tokens and projects can set up community liquidity, and bootstrap it to a level commensurate to their size. This opens the door to all kinds of novel uses and developments.\nUser-Centric DeFi\nThe Verus community believes that community driven liquidity does not need to be driven entirely by yield farming (and increased costs to users), but that ample liquidity will emerge under near-zero-cost conditions, and that this liquidity will provide the lowest friction, lowest cost, lowest risk, fairest conversion transactions for the crypto and wider financial communities. As discussed above, liquidity will come from investors using multi-reserves as novel investment vehicles, from system liquidity (where continuous use begets its own liquidity), and from novel probabilistic arbitrage strategies which may result in staying \u201cinvested\u201d in multi-reserves for multi-block periods. Also, coin communities, whales, and others who wish to bootstrap liquidity can do so more easily than in a VM-based system because they can do it with less risk and cost.\nWhat is Verus\u2019 DeFi Universe?\nVerus is currently in the advanced stages of implementing its decentralized bridging protocols which will allow various coins, both ETH-like and UTXO coins, and others, to be represented on the Verus system in a decentralized manner, and it will also allow all Verus-created currencies to be sent to and represented in the Ethereum network as automatically created ERC20 tokens.

Then, in the above example, if purchases of ETH exceed sales of ETH (in the block in which I transact), then the price, from my perspective will have improved from that existing immediately prior to my transaction \u2014 the direct opposite of slippage. In a robustly-used system, it should be true that overall slippage experienced by users will be significantly lower than in a serial-based system.\nImproved Benefits for Users\nA significant benefit, covered extensively already, is that users (converters) can expect to receive the fairest, best price without any needed sophistication, trading algorithms, bots, superior infrastructure investment, and the like. In a \u201cpool\u201d that is fairly large (compared to my trading size) and regularly transacted, I can simply issue a sendcurrency command, and transact at market, with a calm and confidence that is rare in other serial-based heavily-gamed markets.\nIn fact, because of parallel processing, and the fact that", "./raw_text_input_medium/Verus\u200a\u2014\u200aSuperior DeFi for Community Driven Liquidity-2020-10-16 16:08:12"]]], [["User:: I'm really interested in the vision of Verus for the future of decentralized applications and services.

What this means is that as people use the cross-chain, DeFi, or purchase/register IDs on the network, the miner or staker will put all fees into the on-chain \u201cfee pool\u201d, and then take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward.

Under these circumstances, It should be easy enough for community members to become comfortable with the value of CommCurr, as they see that it can always be acquired and disposed for USD, immediately, and at a predictable and stable price. It\u2019s important to note that if the issuing community doesn\u2019t sell/convert any of its holdings it is *impossible* that the value of CommCurr would fall below its initial value of 1:1 vis-a-vis the USD.\nIf regular use persists, there will be constant demand for the currency and a certain float will begin to remain in circulation. In our example, let\u2019s say the community reaches the point where 100,000 CommCurr is more or less always outstanding, in some form of transit circulating through, or being held by, the community. This would tend to increase the value of CommCurr some amount. But, instead of allowing the currency to appreciate, the Community could begin to draw down on some of the 1,000,000 of initial supply that it holds in its reserves. In fact, in this example, they\u2019d need to convert 100,000 of that supply into USD just to keep the price pegged 1:1 with the USD.\nSo now we would have an exact measure of Community Contributed Value \u2014 in this case it\u2019s 20% of $100,000 = $20,000.

We expect the Fee Pool rewards to exceed the coinbase rewards.\nThink about it: someone creates a PBaaS-chain, 5,000 VRSC goes to the Fee Pool, the winner of the next block gets 50 VRSC extra on top of the coinbase reward.

I've also been wondering about Verus's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. What are the benefits of it?", "AI Assistant:: The benefits of Verus's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism are numerous. For one, there's a low barrier to entry - anyone can run a node and start staking without needing a minimum amount of VRSC. Additionally, Verus has solved the \"nothing-at-stake\" problem, which means there is no slashing of funds. Funds staking are never locked, so users have full control over their funds at all times. It's also relatively low-cost, as running a node can be done with a cheap device like a Raspberry Pi 4. And finally, it contributes to the protocol's natural decentralization.", "User:: Decentralization is a key aspect of Verus, isn't it? How does Verus's decentralized protocol impact its security?", "AI Assistant:: Exactly! Verus's naturally decentralized protocol, combined with its proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms, makes it extremely secure and resistant to 51% hash attacks. This security is inherited by PBaaS-chains, which also benefit from merge-mining with up to 21 chains.", "User:: I've heard about the Fee Pool in Verus. Can you explain how it works?", "AI Assistant:: The Fee Pool is a mechanism in Verus that collects fees generated by various protocol operations, such as PBaaS-chain launches, currency launches, VerusID registrations, and transactions. For each new block, 1% of the Fee Pool is added to the block reward, incentivizing miners and stakers to secure the network. It's a clever way to keep the network secure and healthy."], "AI Assistant", "", "N/A", [["How does Verus reduce the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW mining?", "Verus reduces the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW mining by allowing users to mine with old or broken devices, significantly reducing electronic waste and the energy consumption required to power mining operations.", "that are old or with broken screens. Thus significantly reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW mining.\nThen we have the proof-of-stake part of the consensus mechanism. This one is really simple and powerful. Anyone can run a node and start staking. There is no minimum amount of VRSC needed (pretty unique in the world of PoS). Verus solved the \u201cnothing-at-stake\u201d-problem therefore there is no slashing of funds.

Let\u2019s call our nefarious clever cheater Jamie.\nJamie loads up her self-coded/modified cheat wallet with some Verus and begins staking on the Verus blockchain. Let\u2019s say to cheat she is simply trying to \u201cdouble spend\u201d by casting her votes on both the main chain and any forked or orphaned block at the time of staking.\nWhen Jamie does this and \u201cwins\u201d a block reward, that reward is immature for 100 blocks before it can be spent. At this time she sees the reward in her wallet. On the forked/orphaned chain she has a duplicate stake voted, with a matching UTXO to the main chain\u2019s stake. At maturity, she plans on pulling a fast one and double spending.\nMeanwhile, Stacy is scanning the blockchain hunting for cheat rewards. Her scan catches Jamie\u2019s cheat attempt. What does this mean?\n100 blocks passes and when the reward matures it gets spent, meaning it is \u201cshielded\u201d which is how Coinbase Rewards are spent after maturing. But, cheater Jamie didn\u2019t even get a chance to shield it\u2026it now shows as spent and in place of the funds on the blockchain is proof that she was cheating in the form of her double stake on the fork.\nStacy has taken the reward and it\u2019s now in her private address, ready to unshield and add to her wallet. A nice little bonus of \u201cfree money\u201d for finding the cheated transaction.\nHad Jamie simply staked as normal, without cheating, she would never risk losing her reward.\nAnd here\u2019s the coolest part.

To recap: before any real transactions happen, the Verus network sends proofs to the Ethereum network and vice versa. These proofs are checked and agreed upon by everyone in the network.

It also includes anti-lag measures to further ensure that the software is spending its time efficiently.\nEasier private, encrypted, notarized messages and improved GUI\nThe 0.3.11 software release enabled attaching a private encrypted memo when sending to a private z-address, but there has not been an easy way to view these messages in either the GUI or on the command line.

When a cheater is caught, the miner or staker who caught them can earn a cheat reward, and the cheater's single \"legitimate\" coinbase from the block height at which they cheated is sent to the miner or staker's zs-address before the cheater can spend it.", "User:: That sounds interesting. How does Stake Guard actually work to prevent cheating in Verus?", "AI Assistant:: Stake Guard works by allowing miners and stakers to set a \"cheatcatcher\" zs-address parameter.

This is not a creation of new coins, but rather the redistribution of the cheater's own coinbase.", "User:: I see. What's an important implication of Stake Guard for users of Verus?", "AI Assistant:: An important implication of Stake Guard is that users must ensure they are not inadvertently cheating. This can happen if a user stakes on the same wallet across multiple computers, which can result in the loss of staked rewards. To avoid this, users should only stake from one wallet per computer at any time.", "User:: Okay, got it.
