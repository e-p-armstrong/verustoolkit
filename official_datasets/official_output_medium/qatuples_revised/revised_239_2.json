    "Some potential use cases for digital goods within a namespace on a blockchain protocol include:\n\n* Unique digital collectibles, such as NFT art\n* Verifiable online profiles\n* Transferable tickets or access tokens\n* Decentralized communication networks with unique endpoints\n* Secure sign-on/access control systems",
    "pabilities. For example, if someone called \u201cInfluencer\u201d creates a social token called \u201cInfluencer\u201d, they will have also defined a namespace called \u201cInfluencer\u201d, opening up unique digital goods opportunities.\nDigital Goods \u2014 a namespace on a blockchain protocol renders unique power; a simple model for digital goods on a namespace would include:\nobject definition \u2014 a protocol could allow unique friendly name identifiers within the namespace, meaning fans could register identities/names that are associated with the namespace, eg. \u201cfan.influencer@\u201d, or an influencer could assign meaningful names to digital goods attached to their namespace, eg. \u201cticket0001.influencer@\u201d or \u201ccoolnft.influencer@\u201d or \u201cschedule.influencer@\u201d\nobject control and transferability \u2014 a protocol could allow defined objects to be controlled by private keys and to be transferable from one set of private keys to another, either by command, or in an atomic swap transaction, eg. fans could transfer their objects to and from each other at will, or on automated marketplaces without intermediaries\nobjects as destinations/addresses/endpoints \u2014 as addresses on a blockchain protocol, these objects could receive, send and hold funds, or control other objects; eg. money could be sent to or from \u201cfan.influencer@\u201d; also, objects could be endpoints, and so could receive messages or be unique points in a communications network\nobject metadata \u2014 objects could contain space for metadata, and leverage data structures and off-chain storage (either centralized or decentralized, like arweave) to allow for arbitrary and updateable data to be associated with the object. Coupled with #3 above this allows objects to exist as NFT art, or verifiable online profiles\nobject signatures \u2014 being cryptographically unique, objects could provide verifiable signatures to arbitrary data, thus allowing for applications like sign-on/access, ",
