    "What is Verus Proof of Power (VerusPoP), and how does it protect the VerusCoin blockchain from 51% hash attacks?",
    "Verus Proof of Power (VerusPoP) is a unique consensus mechanism that combines 50% Proof of Work (PoW) and 50% Proof of Stake (PoS) to generate new blocks. This hybrid approach helps prevent 51% hash attacks by requiring an attacker to control more than 50% of the validation power, also known as Chain Power. Additionally, VerusCoin utilizes Komodo's delayed Proof of Work, which notarizes the Verus blockchain into the Bitcoin blockchain, leveraging Bitcoin's hashrate to defend the Verus network.",
    "Verus Proof of Power (VerusPoP): A Provable Hybrid Solution to 51% Hash Attacks\nVerusCoin has a unique consensus mechanism: it is 50% Proof of Work and 50% Proof of Stake. This means that half of newly generated blocks come from mining (PoW), and the other half comes from staking (PoS). Verus\u2019 staking algorithm solves the two major theoretical issues undermining other PoS systems, \u201cnothing at stake\u201d and \u201cweak subjectivity\u201d by leveraging its smart transaction capabilities to remove any incentive to attempt cheating, making it a losing proposition.\nThis mechanism is called Proof of Power or VerusPoP and provides a further decentralizing effect on the network, incentivizing holders to keep nodes online to support the network. Even if a change in network hashrate happens, the PoW/PoS ratio stays the same: 50/50%.\nTo successfully attack the VerusCoin blockchain, more than 50% of the validation power is needed, called Chain Power. On top of that, VerusCoin utilizes Komodo\u2019s delayed Proof of Work. This means the chain is constantly being notarized into the Bitcoin blockchain on every bitcoin block, leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate to help defend the Verus network.\nIn over two years of mainnet, VerusCoin has never experienced a successful 51% hash attack.

Anyone can create a VerusID with our easy to use multi-currency wallet, Verus Desktop, or through the Command Line (CLI) [find both here]. A creator of a VerusID pays a fee of 100 VRSC, or 80 VRSC when using a referral. These fees go 100% to miners and stakers. Here is a list of the ",
