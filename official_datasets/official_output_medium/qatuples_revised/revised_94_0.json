    "What is the main goal of the Verus Interoperability Protocol (VIP)?",
    "The Verus Interoperability Protocol (VIP) aims to provide a secure, scalable, decentralized, and multi-modal cross-chain protocol for blockchains and the Internet of Value. It achieves this through a roof root notarization process and cryptographic proof.",
    "roof root notarization process and using cryptographic proof as the foundation of a provable, high throughput, cross-chain export/import protocol, VIP enables the most secure, scalable, decentralized and multi-modal cross-chain protocol ever designed for blockchains and the Internet of Value.\nTry the Verus Protocol Yourself! \u2705\nLook up docs.verus.io to use many API commands (e.g. launching currencies, tokens & liquidity pools).\nOr look up the complete command list here.\nJoin the community.
