    "How does the Verus multi-currency basket work, and what are its key characteristics?",
    "The Verus multi-currency basket is a fractal, market-driven, and completely liquid worldwide network of independently valued currencies. There is currently no limit to the number of currencies that can be included in a basket, although the team is considering limiting it to ten for now. The basket must include VRSC, and all currencies are combined into a single, fungible currency with the benefits of each individual currency.",

Taken to the extreme, one community member has created \u201cSuperMegaGigaCoin\u201d on testnet, with 12 currencies combined in the basket. All baskets must include VRSC.\n5.
