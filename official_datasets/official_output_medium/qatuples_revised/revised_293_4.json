    "What are the environmental benefits of Verus's mining approach?",
    "Verus's mining approach is environmentally conscious, as it allows for low-power devices to mine extremely efficiently. This lowers the entry barrier for participation in blockchain validation, especially in low-income countries, and can even give new life to old phones.",
    "d protocol, to being credibly neutral. Just like Bitcoin before, Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or tax. Verus is not a company or a business. Verus is rent-free and all protocol fees go to the block producers. These facts are super important to incentivize decentralization and to be a credibly neutral protocol in the eyes of the world.\nA Hybrid Consensus Mechanism\nNow let\u2019s unpack Verus Proof of Power, the consensus mechanism of the Verus blockchain, and all PBaaS-chains. It\u2019s a hybrid of 50% proof-of-work and 50% proof-of-stake, and it\u2019s a provable solution to 51% hash attacks. Out of the 1440 daily blocks (on Verus, and when a PBaaS-chain opts for 1-minute block times), half is solved by mining and half by staking.\nVerusHash, the proof-of-work mechanism which disincentivizes ASIC & FPGA development, and favors CPUs, mobile phones and ARM-devices for mining. Mining with mobile phones and for example, Orange Pi 5\u2019s are the most cost-efficient way to do it. This proves a significant leap towards a more inclusive mining environment. It\u2019s accessible to everyone and thus creates a naturally decentralized protocol.\nAn Orange Pi 5 mining farm by community member DCAL4.\nAdditionally, to give even more power to miners, they can merge-mine up to 22 PBaaS-chains simultaneously without sacrificing their original hashing power. This dramatically increases efficiency and network security. So, when considering an unlimited number of PBaaS-chains on the network, each miner can choose up to 22 to mine. They can choose for profitability, or choose the ones they want to support.\nThis approach to mining is environmentally conscious. The protocol\u2019s design allows for low-power devices to mine extremely efficiently. It lowers the entry barrier for participation in blockchain validation, especially in low-income countries, yet can also give life to phones ",
