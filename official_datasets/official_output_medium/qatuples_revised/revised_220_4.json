    "How does the Verus ecosystem create opportunities for arbitrage and increased value flow?",
    "The Verus ecosystem creates a giant system of liquidity where value flows in every direction. Since the value of currencies within the ecosystem may not be aligned with their value outside of it, many arbitrage opportunities arise, leading to more value flowing into the system.",
    "onversion (image 8).\nImage 8: The protocol searches through all fractional currencies to present the best conversion price\nThere is always a value, and always liquidity attached to the fractional and reserve currencies. It will always be possible to obtain a fractional currency, or convert to a reserve currency with any of the many fractional AND reserve currencies that will be available in the Verus ecosystem.\nImportant note: all fractional currencies on the Verus blockchain must have VRSC as one of its reserves.\nEarning Fees\nLike we discussed earlier, holding a fractional currency is besides a portfolio/investment strategy, an opportunity to earn fees.\nLet's say one holds NewCurrency from image 2. Every time a user converts VRSC to ETH, or ETH to VRSC, 0.025% of the transaction in VRSC stays in the NewCurrency reserve. This means that the total value of NewCurrency goes up which is beneficial for the holder.\nJoin the Revolution\nWhat makes Verus unique compared to its competitor Ethereum, is that in Verus all blocks are solved simultaneously. Front-running will not be possible. Read more in-depth information on the differences between Verus and Ethereum DeFi.\nA giant system of liquidity will emerge, with value flowing in every other direction. Many times the value of the currencies in the Verus ecosystem will not be aligned with the same currencies outside of the ecosystem. Many arbitrage opportunities will arise which means more value flowing into the system.\nEssentials\nVerus Website\nGet Verus Desktop\nMining Software & Pools\nGitHub Repository\nBlock Explorer\nCoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, CoinPaprika\nJoin the Verus Community\nOfficial Twitter\nDiscord\nCommunity Telegram\nFacebook\nMedium\nReddit\nBitcoinTalk",
