    "How does Verus Coin ensure privacy for its users, particularly in applications like voting and identity systems?",
    "Verus Coin uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to ensure maximum privacy for its users. This allows for a mix of openly explorable transactions (like Bitcoin) and completely private transactions, making it suitable for applications like voting and identity systems where privacy is crucial.",
    " by community member @M_eyse\nSo far, Verus Coin has proven to be working tech and NO hype.\nIt\u2019s asking us to participate in taking back our privacy and to be part of a movement that will be world-changing in critical public systems like polls and voting, as well as identity systems.\nForget the hype \u2014 build things\u2026 \u2014 Ivan on Tech\nIt\u2019s a project that\u2019s building working tech right out of the gate, with minimal fuss and marketing. There is no marketing team because this isn\u2019t about raising funds and paying big bonuses. It\u2019s about a decentralized movement and a strong, involved community.\nInfographic created by community member @M_eyse\nLet\u2019s review Verus Coin\u2019s key features\u2026\nA completely new proof of work / proof of stake hybrid algorithm with 50% of each for maximum protection against 51% attacks, further backed by Komodo platform\u2019s delegated proof of work, which offers additional attack protection and recycles Bitcoin\u2019s hashpower, making Verus coin possibly the most attack resistant decentralized blockchain in existence. Delayed proof of work basically creates a system restore or checkpoint on Bitcoin\u2019s chain. Because Bitcoin has by far the largest hashrate it\u2019s incredibly secure.\nInfographic created by community member @M_eyse\nThe fastest proof of work has in the world by far on CPUs, furthering the goal of extreme decentralization by making Verus Coin mineable by anyone with a PC or laptop.\nFrom what I understand, even though GPUs will soon be able to mine Verus, the performance tests discussed in Discord suggest that CPUs will be effective for mining indefinitely, at least until ASICs are developed for VerusHash.\nThis is a project aiming to protect people\u2019s identities and data when they vote, so it makes sense they have Zero knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) for maximum privacy, enabling a mix of bitcoin style transactions that are openly explorable combined with completel",
