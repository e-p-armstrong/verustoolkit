    "How does the Verus Protocol handle cross-chain communication, and what are the safeguards against bridge hacks?",
    "The Verus Protocol handles cross-chain communication through a decentralized and provable system, using a bridge that connects different blockchains (such as Verus and Ethereum). To prevent bridge hacks, the system has several safeguards in place, including:\n\n1. Notary witnesses: A majority of witnesses would need to collude or have their private keys stolen to mount a successful attack.\n2. Fake block producers: Attackers would need to create an alternate protocol and have more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain.\n3. Developer assistance: Developers would need to create an alternate protocol for the shadow chain.\n\nAdditionally, notary witnesses can auto-revoke their identities using the VerusID protocol if they sign for something they don't agree with, preventing stolen key attacks.",
    "here on how the Verus Protocol handles cross-chain communication (PBaaS-chains and more) in a decentralized and provable way.\nSafeguards Against Bridge Hacks\nThreats caused by malicious notary witnesses, or stolen keys to drain funds are not viable against the Verus-Ethereum bridge. To successfully mount an attack on the bridge, if a majority of witnesses were colluding or got their private keys stolen the following would need to happen:\nColluding, malicious witnesses.\nFake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain.\nDevelopers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow chain.\nThese requirements are very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain. The bridge even provides a way to defend against such an unlikely scenario.\nThe notary witnesses are also monitoring notarizations, and if they were to sign for something that they themselves do not agree with, they can auto-revoke their identities, using the VerusID protocol, which cannot be stopped by an attacker unless they have stolen both the keys for the notary ID and those for its revocation ID as well. This serves as a prevention for stolen key attacks, ensuring that notaries are extremely hard targets to compromise.\nBridgekeeper\nThe two blockchains, Verus and Ethereum, are fundamentally different from each other, but still need to be able to communicate. A translator is needed. This translator is a program called Bridgekeeper. Notary witnesses have to run the program. Miners and stakers are also encouraged to run it, and for doing so they receive fees.\nBridgekeeper for CLI / How to become a Bridgekeeper \u2014 video\nVerus \u27a1\ufe0f Ethereum\nLet\u2019s consider a scenario where a user wants to move or convert assets from Verus to Ethereum. This transaction gets recorded on the Verus blockchain. When there are enough, or a certain time period has p",
