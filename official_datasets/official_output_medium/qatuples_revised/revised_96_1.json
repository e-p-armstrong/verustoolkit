    "What is the purpose of the `stakingstatus.sh` script, and how does it work?",
    "The `stakingstatus.sh` script is used to check for new blocks mined. It works by comparing the current transaction count in the wallet with a previously stored count in a file called `txHistory.txt`. If the current count is greater than the previous count, it updates the count in the file, sends an email notification to the specified email address, and runs a backup script.",
    "nc\u2019d up, since you need to generate wallet addresses, etc. I\u2019ll notate which one\u2019s those are.\nThese scripts assume you have VerusCoin in your Home folder and that you are running the scripts from your Home folder. Also, please note with each new script you\u2019ll want to make it executable with chmod +x scriptname.sh replacing the name of course, to the name of your script. You can then run the script with ./scriptname.sh\nScripts You Can Create Before Verus Syncs\nScript 1 \u2014 Check that Verus is Running\nCreate a script called checkverus.sh using nano, and put the following in, changing the reverse IP, username and protonmail email to yours:\n#!/bin/bash\nif pgrep -x \"komodod\" > /dev/null\nthen\n TRUE=\"1\"\nelse\n echo \"Your Miner Has Stopped Staking!!! HELP!!\" | mail -s \"OUTAGE: MinerHostName\" -a \"From: youruser@22.33.44.55.in-addr.arpa\" you@protonmail.com\nfi\nScript 2 \u2014 Check for New Blocks Mined\nCreate a file called txHistory.txt using nano and enter a value of -2, then save and exit. Now create a script called stakingstatus.sh using nano and put in the following, being careful to change the /home/youruser portions to your own username along with the email from, reverse IP and protonmail\u2026and your server hostname for the Subject line of course:\n#!/bin/bash\nhistoricalcount=$(cat /home/youruser/txHistory.txt)\nlivecount=$(/home/youruser/verus-cli/verus getwalletinfo | grep txcount | sed 's/[0-9]*//g')\nif (($livecount > $historicalcount))\nthen\n echo $livecount > /home/youruser/txHistory.txt\n echo \"Your Miner Has Staked More Coinage!
