    "Title: Discord\u2019s Session Hijack Vulnerability and Verus Community\u2019s Response\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/discords-session-hijack-vulnerability-and-verus-community-s-response-c2e9238ca08a\nContent:Discord\u2019s Session Hijack Vulnerability and Verus Community\u2019s Response\nCOPY FROM BELOW THIS LINE TO VERIFY SIGNATURE BELOW\nOne of the first and most important things to announce is that no funds on the Verus network or in Verus wallets were compromised due to this attack, as they were not subject to the vulnerabilities this hacker group exploited. We hope that the hackers were unable to fool anyone into giving up the funds from their Metamask or other Web wallets and that the criminals\u2019 efforts resulted in a negative return.\nThis should be a cautionary tale for any communities using Discord, and we will detail what we experienced, in hopes that it might prevent another Discord community from experiencing the same or similar issues. The hackers used a Discord session hijack vulnerability that is currently in use across some notorious hacking groups along with social engineering to inflict significant damage on the Discord server where the Verus community spends much of its time when coordinating. These attacks had no effect on the Verus network, and although the hackers did get control of the Discord server, they did not need to get full control or credentials for any account to inflict their damage on the Discord server. We believe the attack could easily have been cut short immediately if Discord could improve their false positive account disablement as well as their response time to critical support requests.\nWhat we have determined so far:\n1. The group targeted me and worked to establish trust as journalists for weeks, always persistent, never pushy. After working with me on an article, where I contributed the following content (Verus Article from Hack).\n2. Aft",
