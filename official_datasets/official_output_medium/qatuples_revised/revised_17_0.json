    "What is the main difference between Verus smart transactions and smart contracts, according to Mike Toutonghi, lead developer on the Verus Protocol?",
    "According to Mike Toutonghi, the main difference between Verus smart transactions and smart contracts lies in the application programming model and how each works in context. While there is no direct correlation between the two, smart transactions are generally easier to use in practice to achieve most capabilities in a decentralized fashion.",
    "Title: Verus Smart Transactions vs. Smart Contracts\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-smart-transactions-vs-smart-contracts-f98079c00ed0\nContent:Verus Smart Transactions vs. Smart Contracts\nVerus Protocol lead developer Mike Toutonghi explains the differences between Verus smart transactions and smart contracts.The following was written by Mike Toutonghi, lead developer on the Verus Protocol, on Discord\ud83d\udc47\nApplication Programming Model\nThe way to understand smart transactions vs. smart contracts is to think about the application programming model, and how each of them work in context.\nThere is no 1:1 correlation, but smart transactions are much easier to use in practice to achieve most capabilities, if not all, in a decentralized fashion.\nSmart Contracts\nBasically, the current model on Ethereum is:\nYou run on a blockchain where the only currency where accounting is enforced by the blockchain protocol is ETH. To launch, or materialize a token, an account abstraction, or any other form of currency or identity-like structure (NFTs, liquidity pools, etc), you write an executable program/contract, according to accepted conventions, but with no actual checks that you follow any form of math accuracy, interface adherence, or accounting rules whatsoever.\nThe differentiation of these contracts, which are akin to stored procedures in a database, but carry with them the DB schema as well as the interface, is in the way they enable differences of implementation of those accepted conventions.\nConsensus across all of Ethereum is applied to ensuring that the shared, serialized, worldwide computer that is the EVM executes its low level instructions accurately, with no accounting of currencies, exchanges, enablement of efficient, actual IDs, zk-privacy, etc. The currencies that run above the single native security currency, run by arbitrary rules, often opaque or containin",
