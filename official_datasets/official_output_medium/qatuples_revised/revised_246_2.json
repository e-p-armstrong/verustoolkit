    "How does the Internet's architecture provide a better perspective on scalability in blockchain protocols?",
    "The Internet's architecture is a better model for scalability because it consists of millions of interconnected and interoperable servers, servicing billions of people worldwide. This decentralized approach allows for seamless usage and scaling, rather than relying on a single, high-performance server. Similarly, blockchain protocols can adopt a decentralized, multi-chain approach to achieve true scalability.",
    ", which makes them slower, and makes it more difficult to get them to process large numbers of transactions. To get a high tps blockchain you would need to lower the number of validators so they can find consensus more easily, and raise the hardware requirements for running a node so they can process those transactions quicker too. Yet doing so compromises true decentralization. The lower the number of validators, the less decentralized, the less robust. And the higher the hardware requirements, the less accessible it is for people around the world, the less decentralized.\nThe trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the world. We will show you how Verus offers a new and better approach.\nScalability Does NOT Mean High Tps\nTransactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator \u2014 like GHz for computers.\nCryptocurrency protocols often boast about how fast their blockchains are (transactions per second) as an indicator of their scalability. Contrary to popular belief this is a false premise. Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator. Like how we use GHz (CPU clock speed) to indicate how fast a computer is, or an even better example \u2014 how fast servers are.\nTo bring the promise of crypto to billions of people around the globe let\u2019s make a comparison with the Internet. The Internet does not run on one single server. All websites and applications that we use daily are not connected to one single server. The Internet has not been scaled to the world by constantly upgrading the one server to a faster one. It\u2019s millions of servers that are servicing billions of people around the world. These millions of servers are perfectly connected, and completely interoperable so that using the Internet today is a seamless experience.\nNow, with this perspective in mind, let\u2019s ge",
