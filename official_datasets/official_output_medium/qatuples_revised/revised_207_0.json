    "What is the purpose of the \"initialsupply\" parameter when defining a basket currency in Verus?",
    "The \"initialsupply\" parameter is required when defining a basket currency in Verus. It specifies the initial supply of the currency during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People preconverting into the reserves receive from this initial supply.",
    "nCommunity was minted into Jane@ and 50 into John@, this lowered the reserve ratio of the currency.\n\u201cinitialsupply\u201d\nA required parameter for basket currencies (options:33). Does not work with simple token currencies. This is the initial supply during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People preconverting into the reserves receive from this initial supply.\nImmediately after the currency is launched, the supply can be larger due to \"preallocations\".\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"SocialBrand\", \n \"options\":33, \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"], \n \"initialsupply\":500, \n \"preallocations\":[{\"Max@\":1000}]\n}'\n\ud83d\udd0d This is a basket currency called SocialBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves and in return they get 500 SocialBrand distributed among them. Immediately after launch Max@ receives 1000 SocialBrand, lowering the reserve ratio of the currency.\n\u201cpreallocations\u201d\nUse this parameter to receive a chosen amount of funds after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. Funds can be directed to VerusIDs. Works with simple token currencies and basket currencies.\nWhen using this parameter with basket currencies, after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, the reserve ratio is lowered. This is because new currency has been minted after the initial supply (\"initialsupply\") is distributed.\n\u201cprelaunchcarveout\u201d\nOnly works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the rootID.\nAfter the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, a percentage of the reserves is taken and redirected to the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio, making the currency more volatile.\nExample currency:\ndefinecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"BusinessBrand\", \n \"options\":33, \n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"], \n \"initialsupply\":100, \n \"p",
