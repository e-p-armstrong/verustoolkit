    "What is Switch, and how does it work on the Verus blockchain?",
    "Switch is a decentralized currency on the Verus blockchain, fully backed by its reserves. Its initial supply is 20,000 Switch, and its reserves are weighted as follows: VRSC (16%), DAI (21%), USDC (21%), and EURC (42%). This means that the value of Switch is tied to the value of its reserves. Switch can be used to convert between any of the reserves for a maximum fee of 0.05%. It is a MEV-resistant AMM, and 50% of the conversion fees are distributed to the miners and stakers of Verus, while the other 50% stay in the reserves, increasing the value of Switch.",

Its initial supply is 20,000 Switch.\nIts reserves are weighted as follows: VRSC (16%), DAI DAI.vETH (21%), USDC vUSDC.vETH (21%) & EURC EURC.vETH (42%). What does this mean? E.g. when you put EURC in the reserves you get more Switch after preconversion than when you put VRSC in.\nUse Switch to convert between any of the reserves for a max. fee of 0.05%. Switch is a MEV-resistant AMM. Learn more about Verus DeFi.\nSwitch accrues 50% of the conversion fees \u2014 the conversion fees stay in the reserves, increasing the value of Switch.\nThe other 50% of the conversion fees go to the miners and stakers of Verus.\nThere is a risk to holding Switch \u2014 USDC & EURC are distributed by the centralized company Circle.\nThe supply of Switch is dynamic. Switch gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETHor EURC.vETH, and get burned when people convert back to the reserves.",
