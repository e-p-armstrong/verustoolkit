    "How does mining work for Verus PBaaS chains, and what benefits does it offer to miners and chain creators?",
    "Verus PBaaS chains can be mined by VerusCoin miners, who can mine up to 22 different PBaaS chains without losing any of their original hash power. This is called Merge-Mining, and it means that chain creators don't need to worry about setting up their own mining infrastructure. Miners can benefit from the increased mining opportunities, while chain creators can focus on building their blockchain without worrying about mining.",
    "Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS): Launch Your Own Blockchain\nVerus sees a future where anyone can create their own blockchain in an easy fashion. Every blockchain in the ecosystem is independent and customizable. To create a chain one needs to have the VerusID name of the chain.\nChains can be nested to any level, so that a chain, say \u201cNewChain\u201d, that is launched with a VerusID on the main Verus blockchain, can be used to spawn an unlimited amount of new chains, each of these using identities on NewChain, which can be acquired at any cost as selected by the creator of NewChain.\nNew chains inherit the 50/50% PoW/PoS consensus mechanism. This percentage might be customizable in the future.\nA newly created chain can be mined by the miners of VerusCoin. A miner in the VerusCoin ecosystem can mine up to 22 different PBaaS-chains without losing any of the original hash power. This is called Merge-Mining and means that a creator of the chain doesn\u2019t have to worry about creating their own mining infrastructure.\nPBaaS chains will form the basis for a practically unlimited scalability of the Verus system. Popular currencies and tokens can exist and be interchangeable on many Verus blockchains, so that they won\u2019t be restricted or limited by the capacities of a single blockchain.\nA chain can have certain characteristics like launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund. Other options include dynamic coin launch pricing based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carve outs, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations. Additionally the creator can specify coin supply, coin emission with up to three era\u2019s and define the price for identities. All specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary.Multi-Reserve Currencies: DeFi Reimagined\nVerus is curren",
