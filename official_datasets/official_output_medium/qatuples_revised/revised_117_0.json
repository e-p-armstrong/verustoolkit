    "What are the benefits of solo mining with Verus?",
    "Solo mining with Verus allows you to help secure the network by becoming a fully synced node of the blockchain while mining. Additionally, when you find a block, you get the full block reward of 24 coins. While the rewards may be more sporadic, solo mining provides an opportunity to earn a significant amount of VRSC.",
    "rus wallet. This is also a really great way to help secure the network, becoming a fully synced node of the blockchain while mining\u2026and for any block found you get the full block reward. You may not find a block for a while, so rewards may be more sporadic, but a full 24 coins when you do win a block.\n\u201cDual Mining\u201d with Your CPU\nIf you use your CPU to \u201cdual mine\u201d pool and solo, simply \u201csplit\u201d your CPU thread power between the two. If your CPU has, say, 8 threads (common for a 4 Core CPU) you can assign 4 threads to Pool mining and 4 threads to Solo mining. While you should have the same earning potential either way (minus very small pool mining fees), this gives you the opportunity to earn a steady stream of VRSC and every once in a while get that \u201cbump\u201d of 24 coins in a single block mined from your solo miner.\nTo set up dual mining in this way, simply follow this guide for setting up the Solo side and then follow my 5 min quick start guide for setting up the Pool side\u2026making sure to assign the threads you want for each (if you split between just assign half to solo and half to pool).\nMining with Your CPU and GPU\nIf you have a modern and capable CPU AND GPU (for now that means Nvidia for GPU), you can mine using both of these hardware types simultaneously. You can split up your CPU power however you like, Pool mining only, Solo mining only, or both.\nYou can then loop your GPU into the party using the CCMiner available from Verus Discord community member Chris of LOUD Mining. The latest build is available at https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer/releases/tag/Verus2\nPart 2 \u2014 Setting Up Solo Mining with Verus Agama\nSolo mining with Verus enhanced Agama is extremely simple to get setup and started. It takes a little bit more time than setting up Pool mining because you\u2019re setting up a full node (Native mode) of Verus and syncing up the Verus blockchain.\nSolo mining is on",
