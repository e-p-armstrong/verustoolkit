    "What is the Community Contributed Value, and how is it calculated?",
    "The Community Contributed Value is the value created by the community's demand and usage of CommCurr. It is calculated by measuring the persistent float of CommCurr in circulation and the amount of reserves the Community needs to draw down to maintain the price peg of 1:1 with USD. In the example given, the Community Contributed Value is $20,000, which is 20% of the $100,000 persistent float.",
    "immediately converted back by the recipients). Under these circumstances, It should be easy enough for community members to become comfortable with the value of CommCurr, as they see that it can always be acquired and disposed for USD, immediately, and at a predictable and stable price. It\u2019s important to note that if the issuing community doesn\u2019t sell/convert any of its holdings it is *impossible* that the value of CommCurr would fall below its initial value of 1:1 vis-a-vis the USD.\nIf regular use persists, there will be constant demand for the currency and a certain float will begin to remain in circulation. In our example, let\u2019s say the community reaches the point where 100,000 CommCurr is more or less always outstanding, in some form of transit circulating through, or being held by, the community. This would tend to increase the value of CommCurr some amount. But, instead of allowing the currency to appreciate, the Community could begin to draw down on some of the 1,000,000 of initial supply that it holds in its reserves. In fact, in this example, they\u2019d need to convert 100,000 of that supply into USD just to keep the price pegged 1:1 with the USD.\nSo now we would have an exact measure of Community Contributed Value \u2014 in this case it\u2019s 20% of $100,000 = $20,000. If the demand in the community created a persistent float of $1 million, the issuer could draw down their entire supply converting it into USD, and it would still be backed at its original amount, and still be convertible 1:1 with USD..\nNo Free Lunch (well, maybe a free appetizer)\nDid the issuer just make $1 million? No. Remember they had to commit $800,000 of value in the first place to set this up. And, although that investment is never at risk (they can always just convert everything into the reserves at any time to recoup them), there is a certain upfront capital cost there. However, they did clearly m",
