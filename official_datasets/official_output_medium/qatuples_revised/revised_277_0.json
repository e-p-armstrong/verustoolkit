    "What is the payment primitive in the Verus blockchain, and how is it represented?",
    "The payment primitive in the Verus blockchain is represented by the coin $VRSC. This is a fundamental component of the blockchain, similar to how it is in Bitcoin and Ethereum.",
    "e (typically money/electricity/work). This is a sina qua non primitive and is included in bitcoin and ethereum. In the Verus system, the coin $VRSC represents the payment primitive in the blockchain.\nPrivacy \u2014 as a fork of Zcash, shielded transactions in Verus can be fully encrypted on the blockchain, yet still be verified as valid under the network\u2019s consensus rules by using zk-SNARK proofs.\nFinance \u2014 defi that is built into the protocol has important advantages over defi that is built as an application on a global sequential computer, including security, scalability and fairness. As important, defi must be integrated at the protocol level in order for one decentralized system to \u201cmake a call\u201d to another system, ie. for an ethereum user to seamlessly use the Verus defi protocols or Vault functionality without having to engage Verus or the Verus wallet directly; this type of interconnection creates a truly global application platform that matches the reality of a multitude of computing environments and languages\nIdentity/Agency \u2014 the necessity for users to own their own identity, data, social graphs and reputation is self-evident \u2014 Verus takes this a step further and implements identity as a blockchain primitive, thus enabling what Verus believes to be a core requirement for decentralized identities, a path to recover identity if private keys are lost or stolen\nData \u2014large distributed and decentralized systems (eg the internet) are built on exchange of data; Verus believes that the decentralized internet will consist of heterogeneous systems exchanging data that they can all understand (some centralized, some decentralized), and Verus will enable this through the ability to define and publish data structures at the protocol level, which can then be shared across bridges and gateways\nInteroperability \u2014 Verus works at the protocol level to enable any system to communica",
