    "What is the significance of VerusHash 2.0 being the first algorithm to fully equalize GPUs in a way that makes them an option for mining, but not as fast or efficient as mid-to-high-end CPUs?",
    "The significance of VerusHash 2.0 achieving full GPU equalization lies in its ability to promote decentralization by making mining more accessible to a broader range of people. By making CPUs a more viable option for mining, VerusHash 2.0 reduces the need for specialized and expensive hardware, making it more difficult for any single entity to control the network.",
    "te, in what could possibly be described as a \u201cperfect fork\u201d, only weeks from when FPGA miners were confirmed.\nUnlike past efforts to equalize hardware hash-rates across different hardware types, VerusHash 2.0 explicitly enables CPUs to gain even more power relative to GPUs and FPGAs, enabling the most decentralizing hardware, CPUs (due to their virtually complete market penetration), to stay relevant as miners for the indefinite future.\nAnd how appropriate that the numbers on the newly released GPU miner came in, demonstrating successful hardware equalization on Jan 3, the 10th anniversary of Bitcoin itself. To our knowledge, VerusHash 2.0 is the first algorithm to fully equalize GPUs in a way that leaves them an option for mining, but not as fast or efficient as mid-to-high-end CPUs.\nA Foundation of Decentralization\nBitcoin originally began as simply digital, peer-to-peer money, secured using a distributed proof of work consensus algorithm, with the work (mining) originally being designed to run on CPUs.\nWhy CPUs? What\u2019s so special about them? Was it because more powerful hardware didn\u2019t yet exist? At the time it could have been designed to be mined by more powerful devices, corporate budget-level computing, IBM mainframes.\nWhy did Satoshi point to CPUs as the original hardware for mining? And was it Satoshi\u2019s intent to see his algorithm put out of reach of the masses with computers by companies making specialized hardware?\nIn Verus Coin, the community consensus was clear: focus on decentralization and have no fear when solving any problem presented. The community bet is that Satoshi would have preferred that mining be accessible to the broadest number of people, and that enabling CPUs to continue to mine, even alongside more specialized hardware, would be a holy grail of decentralization.\nAn FPGA is a specialized hardware device, similar to an ASIC in performance an",
