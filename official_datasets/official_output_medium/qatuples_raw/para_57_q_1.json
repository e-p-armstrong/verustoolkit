    "What is the difference between Chain Work and Chain Power in Verus, and why is Chain Power being implemented?",
    "In Verus, Chain Work is a measure of the total proof of work difficulty of a chain, calculated as a sum of the proof of work difficulty of each block. However, Chain Work has a weakness called Weak Subjectivity, which can be exploited by malicious actors. To address this, Verus is introducing Chain Power, which is a 50/50 combination of Work and Stake. Chain Power takes into account both the proof of stake difficulty and the actual nonce random amount of work from every block, making it more secure and resistant to manipulation.",
    "he process of catching and being rewarded for finding cheat transactions by getting the cheaters reward, and makes legitimate staking more rewarding by itself. And if cheaters do try anyway, the legitimate staker has a better chance of even claiming those rewards which the system makes publicly visible.\nChain Power and Nonce\nAnother important change being implemented in this new Verus upgrade is moving away from Chain Work to what Verus is calling Chain Power. Chain Power is now replacing Chain Work, solving the threat of Weak Subjectivity.\nChain Work\nWithin chain work, the block index is a sequential index of block entries which \u201cknows the height\u201d of the chain. As you build and add blocks, you add the entry to the block index.\nThis way at any point you have a maintained value that reflects the chain work at that point. The Chain Work is normally a sum of the proof of work difficulty, for any set of blocks.\nChain Power\nChain Power is a 50% of one value and 50% of another value comparative calculation. It\u2019s a tracking of both Work and Stake.\nChain Work is based on a number that everyone calculates the same on every block. You can\u2019t be completely sure of the time and date someone makes a block. So on a very small scale someone could make it seem like they had a little more work, just for a moment.\nWith Chain Power Verus will not just take the Proof of Stake difficulty, it also takes the actual nonce random amount of work from every block, adding it as additional Stake Power. This way no two blocks will match and there\u2019s no way to manipulate this value.\nThis nonce \u201cwork\u201d number will be added to the Stake Difficulty. Someone can\u2019t just grind away at this as a result.\nAnd so, Verus, as a \u201chybrid\u201d combination of Proof of Stake and Proof of Work, will now have a value which is calculated from a comparison between Stake and Work. If stake power is at 20% and work power is at ",
