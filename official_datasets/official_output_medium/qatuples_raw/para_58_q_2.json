    "What is the significance of Verus implementing Chain Power and dPoW in terms of its position relative to traditional Proof of Work chains?",
    "The implementation of Chain Power and dPoW in Verus puts Proof of Stake on equal footing with Proof of Work, without sacrificing principles, cost, complexity, or decentralization. This innovation closes the gap between the security of traditional Proof of Work chains and the efficiency of Proof of Stake, making Verus a trailblazer in the blockchain space.",
    "30% for example, that is a sum total of 50% Chain Power.\nWhat this means is, to attack the blockchain in a way in which weak subjectivity is a problem, the attacker would need to have more than 50% of either staking or mining power given the above example.\nThe implications of this are massive, making a hybrid Chain Power blockchain like Verus a weak subjectivity resistant chain and adding capabilities that far outweigh the security of traditional Chain Work in Proof of Work chains.\nFinally, Verus adds to this Chain Power \u201cpowerhouse\u201d mechanism, delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) by Komodo, extending it\u2019s security even further. Arguably not even necessary given the advancement of Chain Power, dPoW is an additional layer of security and immutability against attack attempts.\nThe Magic in the Logic\nThese improvements and innovations are being released along with Verus Sapling, the latest upgrade from Zcash which Verus is activating at block 227520 (October 30, 2018).\nIn speaking with Mike over the past week it also became apparent to me how wide the gap is between the confidence of brilliant developers such as those in the Verus community and that of investors and not-so-technical community members, who have grown to feel most comfortable and confident with ol\u2019 trusty PoW. Closing this gap will take time and understanding of exactly how these innovations are designed and implemented.\nI hope this article can serve as a starting point in understanding and diving deeper into the genius of these innovations by Verus. Innovations which now put Proof of Stake on equal footing with Proof of Work, using the very same psychology and fundamentals, without sacrificing principle, cost, complexity or decentralization.\nFrom inception, Verus has been a trailblazer in the blockchain space, from the fair non-ico / no-premine launch, to the innovation of VerusHash, to the implementation of a 50/",
