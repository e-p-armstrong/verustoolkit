    "Title: Verus: Profit Generating Protocol for Miners and Stakers\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-profit-generating-protocol-for-miners-and-stakers-2d2b454aa330\nContent:Verus: Profit Generating Protocol for Miners and Stakers\nFuture and present Verus miners: take notice. Be ready to maximize profit with your hardware. Mine up to 22 blockchains with the same hashrate. With Verus\u2019 hardware equalizing hashing algorithm (VerusHash 2.2) you can mine efficiently with CPUs, mobile phones and even ARM devices.\ud83d\udd25 UPDATE 21 MARCH 2024: The first ever PBaaS-chain is being launched on April 1 2024 (not a joke). From then on miners can mine 2 chains simultaneously with the same hashrate!\nMore on the first ever PBaaS-chain launch: piratechain.com/v-arrr\nEfficient Mining\nVerusHash 2.2 is created to level the playing field for all hardware. The hashing algorithm uses the AES/AVX instruction sets built into most modern CPUs to boost CPU hash power.\nMine Verus most efficiently with CPUs, mobile phones and even certain ARM devices. Compare mining hashrates here.\nCoinbase Rewards\n1440 blocks are generated each day. On average 720 blocks go to miners, 720 blocks go to stakers (learn more on staking Verus). For generating \u2014 or finding \u2014 a block, miners and stakers get compensated. This compensation is called a coinbase reward. There will never be more than 83,540,184 VRSC.\nIf you look at the image below, you might think that the possibility of earning VRSC for miners and stakers goes down drastically. We explain next that earnings don\u2019t stop at coinbase rewards.\nVerus Coin Emission Schedule. From block height 10,080 on, all coinbase rewards of 384 and 192 VRSC were timelocked and then unlocked at random block heights. The last of those rewards were unlocked at block height 1,181,520.\nEarning from Economic Activity\nMiners and stakers don\u2019t just earn coinbase rewards (the reward",
