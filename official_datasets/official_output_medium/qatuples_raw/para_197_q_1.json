    "What are some of the features being worked on for the testnet to enable more powerful decentralized use cases?",
    "Some of the features being developed for the testnet include:\n\n1. Simplified and improved ID privacy by adding a \"source of funds\" address to registration, enabling a specific ID or z-address to be used for funds to prepare and register an identity.\n2. Advanced sub-ID registration for decentralized identities with new business models, semi-centralized identities for voting and other purposes, and centralized identities that can be issued and sold via centralized currencies.\n3. Decentralized fractional currencies can issue identities, depending on their parameters, and the person getting such an ID pays the blockchain identity import fee in native currency as well as the specified fee in the currency issuing the ID.\n\nThese features aim to enhance the functionality and usability of decentralized identities on the Verus network.",
