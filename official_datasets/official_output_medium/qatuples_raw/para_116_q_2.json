    "The Verus Foundation aims to learn from network growth, optimize, and tune the Verus network parameters to prepare for geoscale usage by large populations. They are working to strengthen the network and allow people worldwide to mine Verus in smaller amounts, while receiving payouts on a more regular basis.",

In addition to strong encryption, Verus private messaging shields the receiver\u2019s address, and optionally the sender, with the same zero knowledge technology (zk-SNARKs) used in private transactions.\nThe new Verus Coin release also aims to improve Verus network decentralization and performance at scale, while reducing network lag. As a result, it will boost mining and staking efficiency for miners who may have experienced network synchronization delays due to the multiple terahash growth of the Verus network with solo CPU mining in only a matter of days. The Verus Foundation has incorporated learning from the recent network growth to improve performance and optimize network and individual efficiency for the entire Verus community.\nAccording to Michael Toutonghi, lead developer:\n\u201cWe certainly hoped for the kind of network growth we are seeing, and with that growth, we can learn, optimize and tune the Verus network parameters to prepare for geoscale usage by large populations. We are also working hard with a number of pool operators to bring Verus pools online, which will further strengthen the network and allow people worldwide to mine Verus in smaller amounts, while receiving payouts on a more regular basis.\u201d\nWhile there are numerous new features, the new Verus wallet release focused on two pr",
