    "What are some benefits of using Verus?",
    "Verus offers several benefits, including double protection against attacks due to its ability to notarize to Komodo's blockchain, instant security, and zk-SNARK privacy. Additionally, its combination of PoW and PoS consensus mechanisms provides a unique approach to securing the network.",

The Verus coin, VRSC, is a CPU Mineable coin which utilizes VerusHash, the fastest cryptographic hash algorithm in the world. It can be mined on x64 CPUs which has significantly leveled the playing field with GPUs.\nBecause Verus is a fork of Komodo, it comes with the same first in class security features, such as dPoW\u2026a form of Proof of Work that essentially \u201cbacks up\u201d the blockchain to the most secure blockchain in the world, presently Bitcoin. However, chains forked from Komodo can notarize to Komodo\u2019s blockchain. This allows them double the protection against attacks while giving them the effect of instant security, as if they were as mature as the blockchains they are backing up to (notarizing to).\nAlso a part of the package with Komodo comes zk-SNARK privacy. Komodo was a fork from ZCash and has the same level of privacy built into its blockchain. You can learn more about zk-SNARK and zCash here.\nUnlike Komodo, Verus implements a combination of PoW and PoS (Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, respectively). This is a 50/50 split in which half the blocks are mined by mining and the other half by staking. Mining and Staking is done using a modified version",
