    "What is the purpose of the revocation authority, and how does it interact with the primary authority?",
    "The revocation authority is typically assigned to another ID and can be used to revoke the primary authority of an ID, preventing it from spending or receiving funds, staking, signing, etc. The revocation authority can only be changed by the ID that holds it, not by the ID whose primary authority is being revoked.",
    "can use an address (with public and private keys) to send and receive funds. With Verus, however, you can also create a VerusID and use it to send and receive funds. This article is laser focused on features of the VerusID that you can use to protect your funds but VerusIDs are incredibly powerful and can be used as fully self sovereign identities.\nLike an email or web address, VerusIDs can include any combination of letters and numbers. They just have to end with an \u2018@\u2019 symbol. This document uses example addresses such as, Bob@, and Alice@\u2014 but Mogg@ could also be a VerusID, or BigCompany@, or BurgundySocksfortheHolidays@, or whatever.\nVerusIDs are controlled by one or more associated addresses. For example, if you send funds to an ID, they\u2019ll be available to be spent by that ID and also by associated addresses. As we\u2019ll see, this opens up a lot of design space.\nThe Three Authorities\nEach VerusID is created with three authorities. You can think of an authority as a bundle of specific powers.\nFirst is primary authority. Primary authority allows an ID to:\nreceive deposits,\nspend funds,\nsign,\nstake,\nmodify ID information,\nlock, and\nunlock.\n(We\u2019ll look more closely at those last two \u2014 lock and unlock \u2014 in a bit.)\nSecond is the revocation authority, typically assigned to another ID. The revocation authority revokes the primary authority. When used, it prevents an ID from spending or receiving funds, staking, signing, etc. For example, say you have two IDs, \u201cBob@\u201d and \u201cAlice@.\u201d If you assign Bob@\u2019s revocation authority to Alice@:\nAlice@ will be able to revoke Bob@\u2019s primary authority, making Bob@ unable to spend or receive funds, etc.\nOnly Alice@ will be able to change the revocation authority for Bob@; Bob@ will not be able to change it.\nFinally, there\u2019s the recovery authority. After it\u2019s assigned to an ID, the recovery authority can be used to recover a revoked primary a",
