    "What are the benefits of Verus's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism?",
    "The benefits of Verus's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism include:\n\n1. Low barrier to entry: Anyone can run a node and start staking without needing a minimum amount of VRSC.\n2. No \"nothing-at-stake\" problem: Verus has solved this problem, which means there is no slashing of funds.\n3. Funds staking are never locked: Users have full control over their funds at all times.\n4. Low-cost hardware: Running a node can be done with a cheap device like a Raspberry Pi 4.\n5. Decentralization: Verus's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism contributes to the protocol's natural decentralization.",
    "that are old or with broken screens. Thus significantly reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW mining.\nThen we have the proof-of-stake part of the consensus mechanism. This one is really simple and powerful. Anyone can run a node and start staking. There is no minimum amount of VRSC needed (pretty unique in the world of PoS). Verus solved the \u201cnothing-at-stake\u201d-problem therefore there is no slashing of funds. Funds staking are never locked and running a node can be done with something as cheap as a Raspberry Pi 4. All-in-all proving yet again that Verus is accessible to everyone, creating a naturally decentralized protocol.\nWe can conclude that Verus is truly a decentralized protocol, naturally emerging from its extremely low-barrier mining and staking. So what does that mean for security?\nProtocol Security at Another Level\nSeeing as the Verus Protocol is naturally decentralized and provable 51% hash attack resistant, it\u2019s extremely secure. PBaaS-chains take these properties with them as they have the same consensus mechanism, and the Verus miners can choose up to 21 of them to merge-mine. It\u2019s fair to say that there is no compromise on security given the scalability of the protocol.\nVerus Introduces the Fee Pool\nLet\u2019s first explain the fees the protocol generates for the miners and stakers:\nPBaaS-chain launches: 10,000 VRSC (5,000 for the block producers of Verus, 5,000 for the block producers of the newly launched chain)\nCurrency launches (tokens, basket currencies, liquidity pools, ERC-20 mapped currencies): 200 VRSC\nVerusID registrations: 100, 80, 60, 40 or 20 VRSC\nsubID registrations: 0.02 VRSC\nDeFi conversion fees: min. 0.0125%, max. 0.025%\nTransaction fees: 0.0001 VRSC\nBuilders and users pay these protocol fees for their operations and the fees are directed into the Fee Pool. Then, for each new block, 1% of the Fee Pool is added on to",
