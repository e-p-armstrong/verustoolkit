    "How does Verus handle the representation of external currencies, like ETH, on its blockchain?",
    "Verus' decentralized bridging capabilities, currently under development, will enable the representation of external currencies like ETH on the Verus blockchain. This will allow for seamless conversions between currencies within the Verus ecosystem.",
    "ding currency, without the need for an exchange. Since there is always liquidity inside a multi-reserve currency, soon anyone will be able to convert at any time.\nFor example: a person has ETH and wants to convert to VRSC. That person converts first to the multi-reserve currency ETH*VRSC using their ETH (one transaction), and then they can convert the ETH*VRSC to VRSC (another transaction). In order for this to operate, ETH will need to be represented on the Verus blockchain. This will be handled by Verus\u2019 decentralized bridging capabilities, which are under development.\nThere is no fluctuating gas required, but rather a flat fee of 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to the miners and stakers on the Verus network. Plans are in place to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more. It will allow for the dynamic balancing of volatility, benefiting liquidity providers by offsetting potential losses (impermanent losses) and giving them the opportunity to earn more for providing liquidity, while incentivizing more stability within pools (see #2 below).\n4. An End to Front running\nFront running has plagued traditional markets for years, and blockchain tech, with its public ledgers, has made it even easier for traders looking to game the system, especially on decentralized exchanges. But now, Verus\u2019 new release offers the world\u2019s first solution that does away with front-running, latency wars, and gas price wars.\nThe reserve currency automatically allows for the parallel processing and solving of all DeFi transactions submitted in a block \u2014 a significant advantage over Ethereum\u2019s Virtual Machine and other protocols, which are perfectly designed to perpetuate races and zero-sum games, whereby the most savvy, well-financed players gain all the a",
