    "ch will replace \u201cChain Work\u201d, presents the PoW+PoS blockchain as a far superior consensus model over PoW.\nTo Catch a Cheater\nBefore digging into the crazy complicated blockchain lingo, let\u2019s walk through the process of someone attempting to cheat on the new Verus upgraded blockchain, and see how it works in plain English.\nFor starters the cheater needs to develop a specialized wallet which will attempt the cheats. Let\u2019s call our nefarious clever cheater Jamie.\nJamie loads up her self-coded/modified cheat wallet with some Verus and begins staking on the Verus blockchain. Let\u2019s say to cheat she is simply trying to \u201cdouble spend\u201d by casting her votes on both the main chain and any forked or orphaned block at the time of staking.\nWhen Jamie does this and \u201cwins\u201d a block reward, that reward is immature for 100 blocks before it can be spent. At this time she sees the reward in her wallet. On the forked/orphaned chain she has a duplicate stake voted, with a matching UTXO to the main chain\u2019s stake. At maturity, she plans on pulling a fast one and double spending.\nMeanwhile, Stacy is scanning the blockchain hunting for cheat rewards. Her scan catches Jamie\u2019s cheat attempt. What does this mean?\n100 blocks passes and when the reward matures it gets spent, meaning it is \u201cshielded\u201d which is how Coinbase Rewards are spent after maturing. But, cheater Jamie didn\u2019t even get a chance to shield it\u2026it now shows as spent and in place of the funds on the blockchain is proof that she was cheating in the form of her double stake on the fork.\nStacy has taken the reward and it\u2019s now in her private address, ready to unshield and add to her wallet. A nice little bonus of \u201cfree money\u201d for finding the cheated transaction.\nHad Jamie simply staked as normal, without cheating, she would never risk losing her reward.\nAnd here\u2019s the coolest part. All of this occurs on the blockchain level. There is no ",
