    "What are the implications of VerusHash 2.0 on FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays)?",
    "Although the numbers on FPGAs are not yet available, the results with GPUs strongly indicate that FPGAs, even if more efficient, will not prevent CPUs from remaining viable miners on the Verus Coin network. Two FPGA companies are already working on implementing the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm.",
    "or everyone and which continues to favor decentralization.\nWhat Verus has achieved, with early numbers already in, is the creation of the first ever mining algorithm to fully equalize GPU performance with CPUs. There is still a great deal of optimization work in progress on GPUs in the community, but it is pretty clear that for VerusHash 2.0, GPUs will not dominate CPUs. The numbers on FPGAs are not in yet, as no one to my knowledge has completed an FPGA mining algorithm that works.\nThe results the community is seeing with GPUs, before optimization, strongly indicate that FPGAs, even if 20x more efficient than GPUs, will also not prevent CPUs from remaining viable miners on the Verus Coin network. Two FPGA companies have already expressed that they are working on implementation of the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm, so the great news is that VerusHash 2.0 is likely to also be the first ever field-proven solution to effective hardware equalization across current generations of today\u2019s best mining solutions.\nMine Your Own Verus Today!\nWant to start earning Verus with your PC?
