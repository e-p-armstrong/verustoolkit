    "Sapling is an upgrade to the VerusCoin blockchain that brings significant improvements to the platform. With Sapling, users can enjoy faster shielded transactions, with some reports of near 1-second and even sub-1-second transaction times. This upgrade also enables the use of revolutionary features like Stake Guard, a Crypto-Condition that helps prevent cheated stake blocks and solves the \"Nothing at Stake\" problem in Proof of Stake systems.",
