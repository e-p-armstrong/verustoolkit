    "How does the Verus ecosystem encourage the adoption of new cryptocurrencies and reserve currencies?",
    "The Verus ecosystem encourages the adoption of new cryptocurrencies and reserve currencies by allowing fully community-funded, fairly-launched reserve currency projects, corporate currencies, and more. These projects share liquidity with the rest of the Verus ecosystem, making it more attractive for people to use and convert to them. As more people use a cryptocurrency, its conversion price naturally increases, creating a positive feedback loop.",
    "th their crypto, the more people who use it, the more people who will convert to it, and the higher their coin\u2019s conversion price will naturally be.\nIn addition, the Verus PBaaS protocol will allow fully community funded fairly-launched reserve currency projects, corporate currencies, and more, that all share liquidity with the rest of the entire Verus ecosystem. As a fully decentralized protocol with no company to take a cut along the way, any blockchain costs to launch a PBaaS project on Verus are paid directly to miners and stakers for verification, notarization, and initial conversion of Verus to the PBaaS reserve currency. Any range of the contributions to a reserve blockchain launch, from 0\u2013100% of proceeds, can be transparently routed to the reserves of the fractional reserve currency, with the remainder being distributed, also transparently, as determined by those who launch the chain.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that we are not building these technologies to just talk about them or claim that we did something. We strongly believe that the world needs Verus PBaaS and fractional reserve currencies. Some of us are helping exciting new projects work on use cases in addition to those described in the Verus vision paper, and we fully expect these projects to leverage PBaaS reserve technologies.\nIn one very powerful sense, the Verus reserve ecosystem will have no need for and no overhead imposed by money changers, a virtue that is going to be more and more important as it grows.\nFinally, to introduce some specifics about what exactly has been going on in my deep, dark development hole for the past few weeks:\nWe realized that if the process of moving currency from one chain to another or converting currencies was too complex, fewer people would use it. That led to the idea that you should be able to send from Verus to XYZ chain and wait for your currency to arrive o",
