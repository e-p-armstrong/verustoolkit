    "Verus addresses the issue of rising energy costs through its automatic merge mining feature and its 50% proof of stake, 51% hash attack-resistant algorithm. This allows for more efficient use of resources and reduces the energy costs associated with mining and transaction processing.",
    "tarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n8. Merge mining of up to 22 blockchains simultaneously \u2014 Lets you multiply your hashpower by up to 22x by mining multiple chains at the same time, on the same hashpower.\nVerus has no limit on the number of simultaneously running blockchains across its multi-chain network, and rather than requiring more and more hash power and energy to process the scale of transactions that can be supported across all of these chains, Verus makes merge mining up to 22 blockchains easy and automatic by individuals or even pools.\nYou can discover and select your favorite projects from across the Verus network using the Verus Desktop, and mine them all, effectively multiplying your hashpower by up to 22x. Start your own project and pay some of your costs by mining other currencies as you mine your own. Each blockchain continues to run on its own independent worldwide network, yet you could make your choices to earn rewards on all or some of the blockchains and participate in their cross-chain operation. Together, Verus automatic merge mining and its 50% proof of stake, 51% hash attack resistant algorithm makes runaway energy costs for crypto mining and transaction processing a thing of the past.\n9. Blockchain fee pools and anti-front running \u2014 Addresses MEV and more elegantly solves the EIP1559 problem with a block reward independent economy.\nAs DeFi protocols become the new \u201ckiller apps\u201d for blockchain, soon to be joined by identity and future NFT models, fees earned by miners and stakers in a block can now often exceed block rewards. This is a natural outcome of blockchains being used for commerce and was a consideration of Satoshi\u2019s as the rewards that would replace block rewards over time.\nWhen DeFi protocols, VM-based applications, o",
