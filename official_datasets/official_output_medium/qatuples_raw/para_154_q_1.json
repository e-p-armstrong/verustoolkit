    "What is the relationship between innovation and established companies, and how does this relate to blockchain technology?",
    "According to the text, innovation typically comes from the bottom-up, driven by individuals and entrepreneurs, rather than from established companies. Established companies have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo and are less likely to adopt open, borderless, neutral, and censorship-resistant blockchain technology.",

This is about my perspective on what these barriers are and how Verus fixes them, without getting into all the technicalities.The Lay of the Land\nFirst, let me say this open, borderless, neutral and censorship-resistant stuff is only interesting because of exactly those qualities. It is innovation in its purest form. I can find a market, create a product, and it\u2019s there forever as long as the market exists. Not held back by anyone or anything with opposing vested interests. It\u2019s a beautiful thing.\nInnovation always comes from the bottom-up, never top-down. We are that bottom, we have that power. It may sting, hurt or annoy at first, but eventually, it is accepted and normalized. And so this (still) cowboy cryptocurrency stuff is not any different.\nAnd let\u2019s be clear, innovative entrepreneurship is what this is all about. Contrary to what many people might believe, we can not expect innovation from already established companies. We can not expect them to adopt blockchain technology that is open, borderless, neutral and censorship-resistant. They have everything to gain with keeping the status quo, and more to lose by changing it.\nThe future of cryptocurrency will be single-purpose blockchains. Every idea for a business and project, no matter how big or small, will be created with their own blockchain and thus coin. All working collectively through seamless interoperability or bridging capabilities.\nWe are at the beginning of this very young technology, we haven\u2019t seen anythi",
