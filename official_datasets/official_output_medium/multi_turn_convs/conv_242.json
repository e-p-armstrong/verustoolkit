    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been looking into Verus and I'm curious about the Verus Coin Foundation. What is it, and what is its mission?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Coin Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to realizing the Verus Vision of Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS). Its mission is to support the development of automatic blockchain provisioning on the Verus blockchain, enabling dynamic, fully-featured side chain creation without centralized provisioning or a single point of failure. Additionally, the foundation supports the development of decentralized, public applications powered by the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What is the vision of the Verus Coin Foundation, and how does it plan to achieve it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe vision of the Verus Coin Foundation is to create a public blockchain infrastructure that can scale with the usage of the world's population. To achieve this, the foundation plans to support the development of automatic blockchain provisioning, enabling dynamic side chain creation and decentralized, public applications powered by the Verus network. These applications can be used for various public services, such as polls and voting, identity systems, and other systems that utilize zero-knowledge proofs to respect privacy.\n\n**User:**\nSo, how does the Verus Coin Foundation plan to incentivize community participation in achieving its vision?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Coin Foundation plans to incentivize community participation by offering community bounties in Verus Coins to individuals who contribute to furthering the Verus vision. This encourages community members to actively participate in the development and growth of the Verus ecosystem.",
