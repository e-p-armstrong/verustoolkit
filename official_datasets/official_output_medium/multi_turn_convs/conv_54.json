    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been hearing about VerusHash 2.0 and I'm curious about the bounty offerings from the Verus foundation. What kind of bounty offerings are they offering?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus foundation is offering two bounty offerings, one for GPU development and one for FPGA development, for the first implementation of a competitive miner for VerusHash 2.0 on each hardware type. The bounty amounts are 50,000 VRSC for a qualifying GPU software miner and 100,000 VRSC for a qualifying FPGA development. This is an exciting opportunity for developers to contribute to the Verus ecosystem!\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What are the requirements for a miner implementation to qualify for the bounty?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo qualify for the bounty, the miner implementation must meet certain criteria. Firstly, it must be made open source and available to the community without being used in secret first. Secondly, it must beat the best CPU hash rate by at least 1.5x hash rate for a comparably priced CPU-to-device. Additionally, for GPUs, the target GPU individually performing the qualifying hash rate must be a common and available nVidia or AMD device. For FPGAs, the hardware performing the qualifying hash rate must be easily available and under $1250 per device. Lastly, the implementation must be completed, working, and in a form that can be easily tested by a representative of the Verus Coin Foundation.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! And how will the bounty be awarded and what is the timeline for the bounty offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe bounty will be awarded to the first qualifying implementation for each hardware type. The bounty offer will automatically end after a certain period of time (in this case, 90 days after the release), and may be renewed by the Verus Coin Foundation at its sole discretion. The bounty will be provided as addresses holding time-locked VRSC, which will release uniformly over a certain period of time (in this case, 1 year and ~8.5 months). So, if you're a developer interested in contributing to VerusHash 2.0, now is the time to take action!",
