    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm a miner and I'm curious about the impact of VerusHash 2.0 on my ROI. How does VerusHash 2.0 impact the ROI on various types of hardware for mining Verus Coin?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.0 is designed to significantly close or eliminate the gap between ROI on various types of hardware for mining Verus Coin. This means that the algorithm is optimized to provide a more level playing field for different types of hardware, making it more accessible and fair for miners.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! I've also heard concerns about botnets. What makes VerusHash 2.0 botnet resistant?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.0 is botnet resistant because it strongly advantages modern CPUs over older CPUs. This makes it more difficult for botnets, which often consist of older, compromised computers, to participate in mining Verus Coin.\n\n**User:**\nSo, what's the expected impact of VerusHash 2.0 on the nethash?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe introduction of VerusHash 2.0 is expected to result in a significant drop in the nethash. However, this drop in nethash does not indicate a decrease in the level of security of the blockchain. It is simply a result of the new algorithm doing more work than its predecessor.\n\n**User:**\nI use the Verus Enhanced Agama wallet (GUI) for my everyday transactions. What improvements are being made to the wallet in this release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn this release, the Verus Enhanced Agama wallet (GUI) is being improved to provide full support for any Komodo asset running natively alongside Verus Coin. This is achieved by separating out the daemon for Komodo, allowing both the Verus daemon and the Komodo daemon to run simultaneously. This change will also enable the addition of native support for other coin daemons in the future while maintaining maximum compatibility with each coin supported.",
