    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm really interested in supporting the Verus community, especially with Consensus 2024 coming up. How can I support their participation in the event?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's great to hear! You can support the Verus community's participation in Consensus 2024 by donating to the effort. There are several ways to donate, including using BTC, ETH, or VRSC (or other convertible currencies on the Verus network). The addresses and IDs to donate to can be found on the official Verus community website or social media channels.\n\n**User:**\nThat's awesome, I'd love to help out. Also, I was thinking of attending Consensus 2024 myself. Is there any way I can get a discount on my ticket?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, yes! You can get a 20% discount on your Consensus 2024 ticket by using the code \"VERUSC24\" when purchasing your ticket. That's a great way to support the Verus community and save some money on your ticket at the same time!\n\n**User:**\nThat's awesome, thanks for the tip! I've also been trying to learn more about using Verus, but I'm not sure where to start. Where can I find more information about its commands and API documentation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can find more information about using Verus, including its commands and API documentation, on the Verus website (verus.io) or by checking out the documentation on docs.verus.io. Those resources should have everything you need to get started with Verus.\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to get the hang of it. How can I get involved with the Verus community itself?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get involved with the Verus community by joining their Discord server, following them on Twitter, or visiting their website (verus.io). Those are all great ways to connect with other members of the community, stay up-to-date on the latest developments, and even contribute to the project yourself if you're interested.",
