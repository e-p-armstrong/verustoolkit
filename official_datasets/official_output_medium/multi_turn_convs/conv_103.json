    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to set up StakeGuard in my Verus GUI wallet. Can you walk me through the steps?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable StakeGuard in the Verus GUI wallet, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy your private address.\n2. Click on the gear icon in the upper right corner to enter settings.\n3. Click on Coin Settings on the left.\n4. Select Verus (VRSC) in the dropdown right below the settings icon.\n5. Paste your private address into the StakeGuard address field.\n6. Save your changes.\n\nLet me know if you have any issues or need further assistance!\n\n**User:**\nActually, I use the CLI wallet. How do I enable StakeGuard in that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable StakeGuard in the Verus CLI wallet, you can either:\n\n1. Edit your VRSC.conf file and add a line with the format `cheatcatcher=ZADDR`.\n2. Pass the StakeGuard address as a parameter to `verusd` when launching, using the format `-cheatcatcher=\"ZADDR\"`.\n\nIf you need more help or have questions about the CLI wallet, feel free to ask!\n\n**User:**\nI'm still a bit new to staking in Verus. Can you explain what a UTXO is in this context?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) is an individual transaction output that has been sent to an address or VerusID in your wallet and hasn't been spent yet. When you're staking, it's actually each individual UTXO that's eligible to stake.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any more questions about UTXOs or staking in Verus?\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to a UTXO when it stakes in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a UTXO stakes in Verus, it's actually spent and sent back to the same address again. This means it still shows up in your balance, but it becomes ineligible to stake again for 150 blocks. During this time, the value of the UTXO that staked will be missing from your eligible staking balance, but your other UTXOs remain eligible to stake.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or need further clarification!",
