    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in getting some information about a specific currency on the Verus testnet. Is there a way to do that using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getcurrency` command to retrieve information about a specific currency on the Verus testnet. The command format is pretty straightforward:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency \"CurrencyName\"\n```\nJust replace \"CurrencyName\" with the name of the currency you're interested in, and you'll get the info you need. Give it a try!\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful, thanks! I've been thinking about building on the Verus Protocol, but I'm not entirely sure what the benefits are. Can you tell me a bit more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBuilding on the Verus Protocol has several advantages. For one, it allows for faster development \u2013 you can focus on building the application layer instead of spending time and money on Solidity developers and smart contract audits. Additionally, building with Verus is generally more cost-effective than traditional approaches. And on top of that, Verus provides a secure foundation for your Dapp or business, which is essential for any project.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really appealing. How can I get started with building on the Verus Protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGetting started is easy! I'd recommend joining the Verus community on Discord to learn more about the protocol and connect with other developers and users. From there, you can start using Verus to launch powerful currencies for your brand, business, community, or organization. It's a great way to take advantage of the benefits Verus has to offer.",
