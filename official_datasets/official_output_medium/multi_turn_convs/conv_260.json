    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and I'm still trying to understand the process of confirming a notarization. Can you explain it to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe process of confirming a notarization in Verus involves three main steps:\n\n1. A new, confirmed, earned notarization is entered on the notary chain as an \u201caccepted\u201d notarization, agreeing with a prior accepted notarization along with proof of the agreement.\n2. Notary witnesses sign to agree with the notarization, alternating between PoW and PoS blocks to help further decentralized requirements for agreement, and by following all notarization rules.\n3. After validators and notary witnesses have agreed, the prior notarization agreed with by a new notarization that has passed all necessary agreement is confirmed, making the blockchain final up to that point of confirmation and resistant to reorganizations.\n\nDo you have any further questions about this process?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I've come across the terms \"notary confirm notarization\" and \"auto-notarization\" in Verus. What's the difference between them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe primary difference between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization is the amount and type of evidence required to enter a potentially confirmed notarization. Notary confirm always requires a quorum of signatures from the specified notaries, whereas auto-notarization requires more multi-stage evidence, including randomized proof selection, potential fraud proofs, and disagreements. Does that clarify the difference between these two concepts?\n\n**User:**\nAnother question I have is about notary witnesses. What's their role in the confirmation process of a notarization in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNotary witnesses play a crucial role in the confirmation process by signing to agree with the notarization, thereby confirming that they agree with the notarization. If they disagree, they can choose not to sign, which is also a valid way to disagree. Their signatures help to further decentralize the requirements for agreement and ensure that the notarization rules are followed. They're an important part of the process!",
