    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard about Stake Guard in Verus, but I'm not really sure what it does. Canoc\u00ea explain its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nStake Guard is a functionality in Verus that allows miners and stakers to catch and punish cheaters who try to exploit the network. When a cheater is caught, the miner or staker who caught them can earn a cheat reward, and the cheater's single \"legitimate\" coinbase from the block height at which they cheated is sent to the miner or staker's zs-address before the cheater can spend it.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. How does Stake Guard actually work to prevent cheating in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nStake Guard works by allowing miners and stakers to set a \"cheatcatcher\" zs-address parameter. When a cheater is detected, the cheater's coinbase is sent to the miner or staker's zs-address, preventing the cheater from spending it. This is not a creation of new coins, but rather the redistribution of the cheater's own coinbase.\n\n**User:**\nI see. What's an important implication of Stake Guard for users of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAn important implication of Stake Guard is that users must ensure they are not inadvertently cheating. This can happen if a user stakes on the same wallet across multiple computers, which can result in the loss of staked rewards. To avoid this, users should only stake from one wallet per computer at any time.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. How do I enable Stake Guard in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo enable Stake Guard, you need to generate a new Sapling-type zs-address and start your Verus daemon with the -cheatcatcher parameter set to your new zs-address. For the CLI wallet, you can generate a new zs-address with the command `./verus-cli/verus z_getnewaddress sapling`, and then start the daemon with the command `./verus-cli/verusd -mint -cheatcatcher=zsaddr`. For the GUI wallet, you can generate a new zs-address from the Send section by choosing \"Private Address (Sapling)\" from the Get New Address drop down.",
