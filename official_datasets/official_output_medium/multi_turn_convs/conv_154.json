    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in how Verus enables interoperability between different blockchain systems. Can you explain how it does that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus enables reliable and scalable interoperability between different blockchain systems through the use of \"state root\" and notarization signatures. This allows different blockchain systems to communicate and prove transactions in a way that makes sense, without the need for a Turing complete programmable layer. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about Verus' interoperability?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, I do! I've heard about Verus' PBaaS system, but I'm not entirely sure how it contributes to scalability. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus' PBaaS system enables virtually unlimited scalability by allowing the provisioning of additional interoperable blockchains at will, without the need for additional resources such as hardware, wallets, etc. This system also provides immediate access to the installed base of Verus' miners, stakers, wallets, apps, etc. New blockchains created through PBaaS inherit Verus' security through a system of notarization into the main Verus blockchain. That way, scalability is achieved without compromising security.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting! I've been trying to understand the underlying design philosophy behind Verus. Can you explain it to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe design philosophy behind Verus is to enable secure and permissionless functionality across different systems by allowing data to connect systems, rather than requiring a single language or \"global computer\" to run applications. This philosophy is based on the idea that in the real world, we have multitudes of environments and languages, and things connect through data. By focusing on data connections, Verus enables a more flexible and scalable approach to blockchain interoperability. Does that make sense?",
