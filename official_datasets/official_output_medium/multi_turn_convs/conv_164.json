    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about blockchain architectures and I'm not sure I fully understand the trade-offs between decentralization and scalability. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to explain. In traditional blockchain architectures, there's a trade-off between decentralization and high transaction-per-second (TPS). Increasing the TPS rate often requires compromises on decentralization. To achieve high TPS, the number of validators must be reduced, making the network less decentralized and robust. Additionally, higher hardware requirements are needed to process transactions quickly, making it less accessible to people around the world, which further compromises decentralization.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But I've also heard people talking about scalability in blockchain protocols, and I'm not sure I understand what they mean. Is it just about high transactions per second?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a common misconception. The common misconception is that scalability is equivalent to high transactions per second (TPS). However, TPS is just a performance indicator, similar to GHz for computers or server speed. It does not necessarily translate to true scalability.\n\n**User:**\nI see what you mean. So what does true scalability look like in blockchain protocols? Is there a better model we can look to for inspiration?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Internet's architecture is a better model for scalability. It consists of millions of interconnected and interoperable servers, servicing billions of people worldwide. This decentralized approach allows for seamless usage and scaling, rather than relying on a single, high-performance server. Similarly, blockchain protocols can adopt a decentralized, multi-chain approach to achieve true scalability. This approach allows for greater flexibility, robustness, and accessibility, while maintaining the security and decentralization that blockchain technology promises.",

To get a high tps blockchain you would need to lower the number of validators so they can find consensus more easily, and raise the hardware requirements for running a node so they can process those transactions quicker too.
