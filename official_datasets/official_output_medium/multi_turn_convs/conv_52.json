    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been following along with the process of creating a blockchain using Verus, and I'm almost there. What's the final step in creating a blockchain using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCongratulations on getting this far! The final step in creating a blockchain using Verus is to provide two public nodes to start the chain, review your chain data, and press \"confirm\" when you're ready. After confirmation, a transaction will be created, and once it gets one confirmation, your chain will be visible to everyone connected to the test-net.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds straightforward, but I'm not sure how to get the public nodes required to start my blockchain. Can you help with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can either set up your own public nodes or ask the Verus community on Discord for help bootstrapping your chain and providing you with some addresses to use. The community is usually very helpful, so don't hesitate to reach out.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! So, what happens after I confirm my chain creation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter confirming your chain creation, a transaction will be created, and once it gets one confirmation, your chain will be visible to everyone connected to the test-net on the discover page or searchable on the connect page, and others can connect to it. It's an exciting moment, as your blockchain will finally be live!\n\n**User:**\nAnd what are some benefits of creating a blockchain using Verus? You've mentioned some of the features, but I'd love to hear more about the advantages.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome benefits of creating a blockchain using Verus include the ability to create a secure, zk-SNARK and smart transaction supporting, 51% hash attack resistant, publicly mineable and stakeable blockchain without relying on any centralized entity. Additionally, you can mine and stake your own project and use the same hash power to mine and stake up to 14 other coins, earning cryptocurrency while helping other teams and realizing your own unique vision. Verus offers a lot of flexibility and opportunities for creators and users alike.",
