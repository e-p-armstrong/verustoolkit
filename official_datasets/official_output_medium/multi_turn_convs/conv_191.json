    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand more about Verus and its features. Can you explain the difference between a decentralized and centralized simple token currency in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, a decentralized simple token currency has a static supply, whereas a centralized simple token currency's supply can be increased by the owner of the rootID, who can mint new tokens into existence. Additionally, anyone can burn tokens in a centralized simple token currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. What's the purpose of the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge in relation to simple token currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge allows for the mapping of simple token currencies to Ethereum ERC-20s, enabling the transfer of ERC-20s between Verus and Ethereum. This provides a lot of flexibility and interoperability between the two blockchain ecosystems.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about SubIDs in Verus. Can you tell me more about what they are and how they're related to currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSubIDs are powerful objects on the Verus blockchain that can be registered in unlimited amounts under any created currency (basket and simple token currency). They're essentially a namespace that can be bound to various things like people, products, content, data, and provable information, and can also be used as a friendly name blockchain address to receive, send, hold, and stake funds.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. I've also heard about a \"content multimap\" in the context of SubIDs. What is that, and what does it allow?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe \"content multimap\" is a feature of SubIDs that allows for the storage and management of various types of information, including public and private data, provable contracts, and rights. It provides read, write, and delete functions, enabling the processing of information in the mempool of the blockchain. This opens up a lot of possibilities for decentralized data management and more.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I was wondering what's required to launch a currency in Verus, and how customizable are the parameters?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a currency in Verus, no coding is required. Instead, users can simply choose the desired parameters to create a currency that suits their needs. The parameters are customizable, but not all are needed or combinable, and care should be taken when selecting them to achieve the desired outcome. This makes it accessible to a wide range of users, from individuals to organizations and businesses.",

When it\u2019s a centralized version, the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn them.\nThis option is also used to create currencies that are mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s.

They can be registered in an unlimited amount under any created currency (basket and simple token currency). A few examples are product.MyBrand@ or user.MyBrand@.

They can be bound to people and products. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private. Including provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the subID itself.\nAnother powerful feature is that it has read, write and delete functions in what is called the \u201ccontent multimap\u201d.
