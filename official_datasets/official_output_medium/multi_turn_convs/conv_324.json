    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in mining with Verus, can you tell me what's the main benefit of VerusHash 2.2 for miners?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusHash 2.2 is designed to level the playing field for all hardware, making it possible for miners to mine efficiently with CPUs, mobile phones, and even certain ARM devices. This means that miners can maximize their profit with their existing hardware. You don't need to invest in expensive specialized equipment to be a successful miner.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds great! How many blockchains can I mine with the same hashrate using Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWith Verus, you can mine up to 22 blockchains with the same hashrate. This means you can diversify your mining efforts and increase your potential earnings.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that VerusHash 2.2 uses AES/AVX instruction sets. What's the purpose of those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe AES/AVX instruction sets are used to boost CPU hash power, making mining more efficient. This allows you to get the most out of your hardware and maximize your mining potential.\n\n**User:**\nHow do miners and stakers get compensated in the Verus protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMiners and stakers are compensated through coinbase rewards, which are given for generating or finding a block. On average, 720 blocks are awarded to miners and 720 blocks are awarded to stakers each day. This provides a steady stream of income for those who contribute to the network.\n\n**User:**\nIs there a limit to the total amount of VRSC that will be created?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there will never be more than 83,540,184 VRSC created. This limited supply helps to maintain the value of the currency and prevents inflation.\n\n**User:**\nAre coinbase rewards the only way for miners and stakers to earn VRSC?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, miners and stakers can also earn VRSC through economic activity, in addition to coinbase rewards. This provides additional opportunities for those who contribute to the network to earn more VRSC.",
