    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been following the developments in Verus and I was wondering, what are the key updates in Verus Desktop v0.9.5?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Desktop v0.9.5 introduces two new APIs and CLI commands: `signdata` and `verifysignature`. These updates provide a more powerful and flexible framework for NFTs and ID-bound legal rights and agreements. Additionally, this release updates the Komodo notaries to season 6, which is required to reliably stay synchronized to the Verus mainnet.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What are the new capabilities of the `signdata` and `verifysignature` APIs in Verus Desktop v0.9.5?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `signdata` and `verifysignature` APIs in Verus Desktop v0.9.5 enable advanced digital signing and verification capabilities. They allow for easily binding together multiple sources of content, documents, identities, and VDXF keys into one verifiable signature, and then verifying that signature, including all of its specific bindings.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard there are some exciting updates coming to the mainnet. What are some key features of the upcoming Verus PBaaS mainnet upgrade?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the upcoming Verus PBaaS mainnet upgrade promises to deliver several key features, including no-programming-needed blockchain and currency launches, MEV-free DeFi, and non-custodial Ethereum bridging, among others.\n\n**User:**\nI've seen some discussion about improvements to the anti-MEV DeFi protocol. What is the purpose of the protocol improvement introduced by community developers for the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe protocol improvement aims to make the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol even more resistant to multi-block attempts at MEV (Maximum Extractable Value). This will enhance the security and efficiency of the protocol.",
