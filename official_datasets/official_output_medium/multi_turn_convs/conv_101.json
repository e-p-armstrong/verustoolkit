    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still learning about Verus and its cross-chain operations. Can you tell me about the different proof models used in Verus for cross-chain operations, and how are they configurable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus uses three different proof models for cross-chain operations: decentralized consensus-achieved, witness-enhanced, cross-chain cryptographic proofs (auto-notarization); decentralized consensus-achieved, witness-dependent, cross-chain cryptographic proofs (notary-dependent notarization); and semi-centralized or centrally controlled gateway proofs. These proof models are configurable on a per-system/chain basis, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in different use cases. This flexibility is one of the key strengths of Verus, as it allows different chains and systems to tailor their cross-chain operations to their specific needs.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I'd like to know more about the notarization process. How do earned notarizations get confirmed in Verus, and what happens after confirmation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEarned notarizations get confirmed according to the confirmation rules, which may vary depending on whether the rules are \"auto\", centralized, or \"notary confirm\". Once a new, earned notarization is confirmed, the proof of confirmation is sent to the notary system, typically a launch chain, along with any necessary notary signatures to prove confirmation. This ensures that the notarization is properly recorded and recognized across the Verus network. Does that help clarify the notarization process?",
