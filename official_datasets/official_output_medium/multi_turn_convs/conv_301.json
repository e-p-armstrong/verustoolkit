    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the fees involved when using Verus. How are fees handled when issuing identities, tokens, or native currencies on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen issuing identities, tokens, or native currencies on Verus, the fees are paid to the controlling ID of the currency, not burned. This means that the fees are directed to the entity responsible for managing the currency, rather than being removed from circulation.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also heard that Verus supports some new issuance options. What are they, and how do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus supports two new issuance options: \"requires permission\" and \"referral required\". If specified in an ID issuing currency definition, the identity registration transaction must be counter-signed by either the ID of the issuing currency (\"requires permission\") or a valid referrer (\"referral required\"), which may be the issuing currency ID or an unrevoked ID with the same parent as the new identity. This adds an additional layer of control and validation to the issuance process.\n\n**User:**\nHow does Verus handle pricing and referrals for identity namespaces?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus supports separate pricing, referral namespaces, and referral levels for all identity namespaces. This means that only specific IDs (e.g., *.fanclub@) can refer for certain identities (e.g., name.fanclub@). This allows for a high degree of customization and precision in managing identity namespaces and their associated pricing and referral structures.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about how sub-IDs for a fractional currency can be priced on Verus.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn Verus, sub-IDs for a fractional currency can be priced in either the currency itself or denominated in any of its reserves (e.g., USD, VRSC, EUR, etc.). This enables compatibility with ID-based rights licensing or royalty streams priced in any currency, making it a flexible and powerful tool for managing complex financial arrangements.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I'd like to know more about gateway registration on Verus. What's its purpose, and how does it work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGateway registration on Verus allows for the issuance of IDs (e.g., mike.veth@) priced in a specific currency (e.g., USD) and paid in a gateway-specific currency (e.g., Bridge.VETH). This enables the creation of \"mapped currencies\" using the gateway-registered IDs, such as BAT.vETH mapped to Ethereum BAT. This feature facilitates the integration of Verus with external systems and currencies, further expanding its capabilities and reach.",
