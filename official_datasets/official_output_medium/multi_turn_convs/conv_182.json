    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand how Verus maintains its stability, and I came across something called the Fee Pool. What is the purpose of the Fee Pool in Verus, and how does it contribute to the protocol's stability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Fee Pool is a security measure in Verus that helps maintain the protocol's stability. It does this by spreading extra fees over multiple blocks, preventing block producers from trying to \"snipe\" blocks for their own gain, which can destabilize the protocol. This way, the Fee Pool ensures that the protocol remains stable and secure.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also been reading about the application models used by different blockchain protocols, and I was wondering about the security concerns associated with the VM-based application model used by most blockchain protocols. How does Verus differ from this approach?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VM-based application model, commonly used in other blockchain protocols, has several security concerns, including smart contract hacks and bugs, insecure wallet approval mechanisms, and MEV (maximum extractable value) exploitation due to serial processing of transactions. Verus takes a different approach, securing all operations directly through consensus, rather than relying on smart contracts or L2 solutions. This approach allows Verus to avoid the security risks associated with VM-based models.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. So, can Verus be used to build capable and secure dApps, and if so, how does it compare to the VM-based application model?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, Verus can be used to build capable and secure dApps. In fact, developing dApps with Verus is more straightforward and results in more capable, secure, and scalable solutions compared to the VM-based application model. Verus's approach to securing operations through consensus makes it a more secure and reliable platform for building dApps.",
