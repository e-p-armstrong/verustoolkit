    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating my own blockchain project, but I'm not sure where to start. What are some challenges that creators face when trying to bring their blockchain ideas to life?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCreators may face numerous challenges when trying to bring their blockchain ideas to life, including having to fork a Github repository, create an Amazon AWS or Droplet account, subscribe to centralized services, and set up an array of servers. Additionally, they may struggle with growing a community, getting listed on exchanges, building a wallet, creating infrastructure, finding help, and publishing their idea. It can be a daunting task, but there are ways to make it easier.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds overwhelming. What is the problem with the current process of creating a blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe current process of creating a blockchain can be challenging, time-consuming, and expensive. It often requires creators to rely on centralized solutions, jump through numerous hurdles, and deal with multiple different companies. This can be a barrier to entry for many people, and may prevent some ideas from being brought to life.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What is the main issue with the traditional approach to creating a blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main issue with the traditional approach to creating a blockchain is that it requires creators to rely on centralized solutions and jump through numerous hurdles, which can be a barrier to entry and prevent some ideas from being brought to life.\n\n**User:**\nIs there a better way to create a blockchain and bring ideas to life?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are alternative approaches to creating a blockchain that can make it easier and more accessible for creators to bring their ideas to life. One such approach is Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS), which allows creators to focus on their ideas without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. It's a more streamlined and efficient way to create a blockchain, and it can help level the playing field for creators.",
