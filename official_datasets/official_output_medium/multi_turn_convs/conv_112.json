    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a member of the old Verus Discord server and I'm seeing some suspicious announcements. They're claiming to have giveaways with Ethereum tokens backed by Verus. What should I do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBe cautious! Those announcements are likely scams, and interacting with them could put your assets at risk. Do not engage with them. Instead, leave the Discord server as soon as possible and avoid engaging with any suspicious links or messages. Your safety is important, and it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. How can we prevent security incidents, such as server takeovers, from occurring in the future?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo prevent security incidents, such as server takeovers, it's essential to implement robust security measures. This includes secure login credentials, two-factor authentication, and regular security audits. Additionally, Discord admins can establish a set of processes to prevent scammers from taking control of the server, such as regularly monitoring the server for suspicious activity, having multiple admins with different roles and permissions, and establishing clear communication channels for reporting incidents. By taking these steps, we can minimize the risk of security incidents and ensure a safe and secure environment for our community.",

Since then, they started announcing scam links, claiming fraudulent giveaways with Ethereum tokens backed by Verus on websites that if someone with a Metamask or similar wallet engages with, there is a risk of taking assets from them on Ethereum or possibly other networks, not Verus.\n6. We still have not heard from or gotten help from Discord Support since this event began, except that they banned my account, and to our knowledge the scammers are still in the old Verus Discord server attempting to scam an ever dwindling group of members who haven\u2019t left by now.\n7. If you know anyone in the old Discord, please inform them to leave the Discord asap and not engage in any of the announcements, as they are made by impersonators, while people trying to warn are banned and the original admins are locked out of the server.\n8.

My new account is miketout.vrsc (this ID), which is not the owner of this Discord, and we have implemented a set of processes for all Discord admins to prevent any such event from occurring again.\nSince the Verus Community is much more than a Discord Server, though",
