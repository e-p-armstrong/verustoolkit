What features does it offer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusBox is a mobile tool developed by community builders that provides users with a convenient way to access various Verus-related information on their phones. It allows users to view the blockchain and network status, including hashrate and network distribution, as well as market cap and coin price. Additionally, it can be used as a block explorer, offering even more features for Verus enthusiasts. It's a great way to stay up-to-date with what's happening on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really useful. I've also heard about something called Vault. Can you explain what it is and how it works in relation to VerusIDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVault is a feature that allows users to lock their funds in a VerusID, making it impossible to spend them while still enabling staking. This provides an added layer of security and control over one's funds. It's a great way to ensure that your funds are safe and secure, while still being able to participate in the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard about VaultAlert.

By visiting the website and searching for their VerusID, users can access information about their Vault, including the status, type of lock, unlock block height, and date estimates.
