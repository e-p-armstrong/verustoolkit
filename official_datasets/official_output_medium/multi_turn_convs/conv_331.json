    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into Verus VIP for interchain communication, and I was wondering, what are the two proof models supported by Verus VIP?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus VIP supports two proof models for interchain communication: the Verus PBaaS Merkle Mountain Range proofs, which assume the Verus Proof of Power protocol, and Ethereum PATRICIA Trie proofs.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful, thanks. I've also been trying to understand the differences between Verus PBaaS and Ethereum proof protocols. What's the main difference when it comes to notarization finalization?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus PBaaS is the only interface that fully supports notarization finalization using full auto-notarization, whereas Ethereum proof protocols do not have an objective implementation that can operate without dependence on a set of notary witnesses.\n\n**User:**\nI'm still a bit unclear on the auto-notarization process. How does the auto-notarization of one PBaaS chain on another (PBAAS_AN) differ from Ethereum interface or notary-confirm (NC)?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPBAAS_AN allows validators to finalize a notarization and submit it to the alternate chain if there are enough validated blocks, mined and staked, as well as validator-agreed notarizations. If there are disagreements about the correct notarization, the process becomes an on-chain proof competition. In contrast, Ethereum interface or notary-confirm (NC) does not have this level of automation and decentralization.\n\n**User:**\nOne last question. How can the Ethereum bridge ensure maximum decentralization in the future?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Ethereum bridge can ensure maximum decentralization by allowing the network itself to permissionlessly propose contract upgrades. If these upgrades are affirmatively voted on by Verus validators, an upgrade and new contracts can eventually change the cross-chain proof conditions, potentially removing dependence on witnesses over time.",
