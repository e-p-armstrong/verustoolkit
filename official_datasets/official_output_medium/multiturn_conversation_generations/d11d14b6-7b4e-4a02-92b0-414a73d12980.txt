    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    What benefit do I get if I move my ETH, DAI, and MKR to the Verus blockchain before
    the bridge is launched?


    **ANSWER:**

    If you move your ETH, DAI, and MKR to the Verus blockchain before the bridge is
    launched, your cross-chain fees are subsidized. The Verus blockchain uses around
    5000 VRSC to subsidize the fees on its side. After the bridge currency is launched,
    the remaining VRSC will be put into the reserves.



    **QUESTION:**

    How does the supply of Bridge.vETH work?


    **ANSWER:**

    The supply of Bridge.vETH is dynamic. It gets minted when people convert to it
    from VRSC, vETH, DAI.vETH, and MKR.vETH, and gets burned when people convert out
    of it.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the purpose of the Bridge.vETH currency?


    **ANSWER:**

    The Bridge.vETH currency is designed to make bridging assets simple. It converts
    fees seamlessly, no matter where you send it from.



    **QUESTION:**

    How does the bridge currency accrue value?


    **ANSWER:**

    The bridge currency accrues fees through cross-chain functions, conversions, and
    .vETH VerusID registrations. This makes it more valuable the more it''s used.



    **QUESTION:**

    What benefit do DAI holders get when holding DAI in Bridge.vETH or the Verus ecosystem?


    **ANSWER:**

    DAI holders get a 5% interest rate (subject to change by MakerDAO) automatically
    when holding DAI in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. This interest rate is
    passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH.



    **QUESTION:**

    What can I do with the Bridge.vETH after it is launched and the initial supply
    is distributed?


    **ANSWER:**

    After the Bridge.vETH is launched and the initial supply is distributed, you can
    convert into any direction, export launched currencies on Verus as an ERC-20,
    launch currencies on Verus that are 1:1 mapped to any ERC-20, send currencies,
    tokens, and liquidity pools cross-chain, and send ERC-721 & ERC-1155 NFTs to Verus,
    and export tokenized ID currencies.

    of it. It''s a flexible system that adjusts to the needs of the users.


    **User:**

    That makes sense. What is the purpose of the Bridge.vETH currency, anyway?


    **AI Assistant:**

    The Bridge.vETH currency is designed to make bridging assets simple. It converts
    fees seamlessly, no matter where you send it from. It''s a convenient and efficient
    way to move assets across different blockchains.


    **User:**

    How does the bridge currency accrue value?


    **AI Assistant:**

    The bridge currency accrues fees through cross-chain functions, conversions, and
    .vETH VerusID registrations. This makes it more valuable the more it''s used.
    As the ecosystem grows and more people use the bridge, the value of Bridge.vETH
    will increase.


    **User:**

    That''s really interesting. What benefit do DAI holders get when holding DAI in
    Bridge.vETH or the Verus ecosystem?

    DAI holders to earn passive income.


    **User:**

    Finally, what can I do with the Bridge.vETH after it is launched and the initial
    supply is distributed?


    **AI Assistant:**
