    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nHi! I'm trying to understand the `signrawtransaction` command in Verus. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `signrawtransaction` command is used to sign a raw transaction with a signature. It's an important tool for creating and verifying transactions on the Verus network. Do you have any other questions about this command?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What is the format of the result returned by the `signrawtransaction` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by the `signrawtransaction` command is a JSON object with the following properties:\n\n* `hex`: a string representing the hex-encoded raw transaction with signature(s)\n* `complete`: a boolean indicating whether the transaction has a complete set of signatures\n* `errors`: a JSON array of objects containing script verification errors (if any)\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these properties in more detail?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please. What information is provided in the `errors` array of the `signrawtransaction` result?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEach object in the `errors` array contains the following information:\n\n* `txid`: a string representing the hash of the referenced, previous transaction\n* `vout`: a numeric value representing the index of the output to be spent and used as input\n* `scriptSig`: a string representing the hex-encoded signature script\n* `sequence`: a numeric value representing the script sequence number\n* `error`: a string representing the verification or signing error related to the input\n\nThese errors can be helpful in debugging issues with your transactions. Do you have any other questions about the `signrawtransaction` command or Verus in general?",
