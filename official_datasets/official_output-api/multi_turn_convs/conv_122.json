    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the `getblockhashes` command in Verus. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getblockhashes` command returns an array of hashes of blocks within a specified timestamp range. It's a useful command for retrieving block hashes within a certain time period. Do you have any further questions about this command or how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, actually. What are the optional parameters that can be included in the `options` JSON object for the `getblockhashes` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `options` JSON object can include the following optional parameters:\n1. `noOrphans`: A boolean indicating whether to only include blocks on the main chain (default: false)\n2. `logicalTimes`: A boolean indicating whether to include logical timestamps with hashes (default: false)\n\nThese parameters can be used to customize the output of the `getblockhashes` command. Do you have any more questions about these options or how to use them?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `getblockhashes` command to retrieve block hashes within a specific timestamp range, including logical timestamps?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getblockhashes` command with the `logicalTimes` option set to true, like this:\n```\nverus getblockhashes 1231614698 1231024505 '{\"noOrphans\":false, \"logicalTimes\":true}'\n```\nThis will return an array of block hashes with their corresponding logical timestamps within the specified timestamp range. Just replace the timestamp values with the range you're interested in, and adjust the options as needed. Let me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!",
