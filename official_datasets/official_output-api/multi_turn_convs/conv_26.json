    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to assist you with any Verus-related questions. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand some Verus commands. What does the `z_gettotalbalance` command do in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_gettotalbalance` command returns the total value of funds stored in the node's wallet. It provides a breakdown of the total balance into transparent funds, private (shielded) funds, and the total balance of both. It's a useful command to get an overview of your wallet's balance.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. Are there any optional arguments I can pass to the `z_gettotalbalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are two optional arguments you can pass to the `z_gettotalbalance` command. The first is `minconf`, a numeric value that specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for a transaction to be included in the balance calculation. The default value is 1. The second is `includeWatchonly`, a boolean value that indicates whether to include the balance in watch-only addresses in the calculation. The default value is false.\n\n**User:**\nI see. Is there a potential issue with using `z_gettotalbalance` if the wallet contains addresses with only incoming viewing keys?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, if the wallet contains addresses with only incoming viewing keys, the returned private balance may be larger than the actual balance. This is because spends cannot be detected with incoming viewing keys, so the balance calculation may include unspendable funds. Just something to keep in mind when using this command.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. How can I use the `z_gettotalbalance` command to get the total amount in the wallet with at least 5 blocks confirmed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_gettotalbalance` command with the `minconf` argument set to 5, like this: `verus z_gettotalbalance 5`. This will return the total balance of funds in the wallet, including only transactions that have been confirmed at least 5 times.",
