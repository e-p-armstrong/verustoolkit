    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm trying to understand the `getbalance` command in Verus. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getbalance` command returns the server's total available balance.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a good start! What are the arguments that can be passed to the `getbalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getbalance` command takes three arguments:\n\n1. \"account\" (string, optional): DEPRECATED. If provided, it MUST be set to the empty string \"\" or to the string \"*\", either of which will give the total available balance.\n2. minconf (numeric, optional, default=1): Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.\n3. includeWatchonly (bool, optional, default=false): Also include balance in watchonly addresses (see 'importaddress')\n\nDo you have any other questions about the `getbalance` command?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what's the result of the `getbalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `getbalance` command is the total amount in VRSC received for this account, returned as a numeric value.\n\n**User:**\nSo how can I get the total amount in the wallet using the `getbalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get the total amount in the wallet by simply running the command `verus getbalance`. This will return the total available balance.\n\n**User:**\nThat's easy! How can I get the total amount in the wallet with at least 5 blocks confirmed using the `getbalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can get the total amount in the wallet with at least 5 blocks confirmed by running the command `verus getbalance \"*\" 6`. This will return the total available balance with at least 5 blocks confirmed.\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing. How can I use the `getbalance` command as a JSON RPC call?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getbalance` command as a JSON RPC call by running the following command:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getbalance\", \"params\": [\"*\", 6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nThis will return the total available balance with at least 5 blocks confirmed.",
