Please, ask me anything!\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `getNotarisationsForBlock` function in Verus. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getNotarisationsForBlock` function takes a block hash as an input and returns notarization transactions within that block. Would you like to know more about how it works or what the block hash is used for?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. What is the purpose of the block hash in the `getNotarisationsForBlock` function?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe block hash is used as an input to the `getNotarisationsForBlock` function to specify which block to retrieve notarization transactions from. It's essentially a way to identify the specific block you're interested in and get the notarization transactions associated with it.\n\n**User:**\nWhat type of transactions does the `getNotarisationsForBlock` function return?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getNotarisationsForBlock` function returns notarization transactions within the specified block.
