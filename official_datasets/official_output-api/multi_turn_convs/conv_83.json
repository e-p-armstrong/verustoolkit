    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm here to assist you with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `sendtoaddress` command in Verus. What is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendtoaddress` command is used to send a specified amount of VRSC to a given VRSC address.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What are the required arguments for the `sendtoaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe required arguments for the `sendtoaddress` command are the \"VRSC_address\" (string, required) - The VRSC address to send to, and the \"amount\" (numeric, required) - The amount in VRSC to send.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about optional arguments? Are there any?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are. The optional arguments for the `sendtoaddress` command are \"comment\" (string, optional) - A comment used to store what the transaction is for, \"comment-to\" (string, optional) - A comment to store the name of the person or organization to which you're sending the transaction, and subtractfeefromamount (boolean, optional, default=false) - The fee will be deducted from the amount being sent.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the result of the `sendtoaddress` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result of the `sendtoaddress` command is the transaction id (string).\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand now. How can I use the `sendtoaddress` command to send 0.1 VRSC to a specific address with a comment and comment-to?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `sendtoaddress` command to send 0.1 VRSC to a specific address with a comment and comment-to like this:\n```\nverus sendtoaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 0.1 \"donation\" \"seans outpost\"\n```\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. How can I use the `sendtoaddress` command with the `subtractfeefromamount` option?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `sendtoaddress` command with the `subtractfeefromamount` option like this:\n```\nverus sendtoaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 0.1 \"\" \"\" true\n```\nThis will deduct the transaction fee from the amount being sent.",
