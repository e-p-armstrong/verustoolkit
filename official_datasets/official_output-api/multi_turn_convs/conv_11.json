    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to use some of the commands in Verus. What's the purpose of the `getaddressbalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getaddressbalance` command returns the balance for one or more addresses. It requires the `addressindex` to be enabled. Do you have any further questions about this command or how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, what are the arguments required for the `getaddressbalance` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getaddressbalance` command takes two arguments: \n1. `addresses`: an array of base58check encoded addresses.\n2. `friendlynames` (optional): a boolean indicating whether to include additional friendly names keyed by currency i-addresses.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the arguments or how to use them?\n\n**User:**\nWhat information does the `getaddressbalance` command return?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getaddressbalance` command returns an object with two properties:\n1. `balance`: the current balance in satoshis.\n2. `received`: the total number of satoshis received (including change).\n\nDo you have any further questions about the returned information or how to use it?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `getaddressbalance` command to get the balance of an address using the command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getaddressbalance` command to get the balance of an address using the command line by running the following command:\n```\nverus getaddressbalance '{\"addresses\": [\"RY5LccmGiX9bUHYGtSWQouNy1yFhc5rM87\"]}'\n```\nReplace `RY5LccmGiX9bUHYGtSWQouNy1yFhc5rM87` with the address you want to check. Do you have any more questions about using the command line?\n\n**User:**\nHow can I use the `getaddressbalance` command to get the balance of an address using a JSON-RPC request?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getaddressbalance` command to get the balance of an address using a JSON-RPC request by sending a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:27486/` with the following JSON data:\n```\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\",\n  \"id\": \"curltest\",\n  \"method\": \"getaddressbalance\",\n  \"params\": [{\"addresses\": [\"RY5LccmGiX9bUHYGtSWQouNy1yFhc5rM87\"]}]\n}\n```\nReplace `RY5LccmGiX9bUHYGtSWQouNy1yFhc5rM87` with the address you want to check. Do you have any more questions about using JSON-RPC requests?",
