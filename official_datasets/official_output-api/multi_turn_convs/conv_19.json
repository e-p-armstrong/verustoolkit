    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help you with any Verus-related questions you might have. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the `getpeerinfo` command in Verus. What is its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getpeerinfo` command returns data about each connected network node as a JSON array of objects. It provides a lot of useful information about the nodes you're connected to.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. What kind of information does it provide about each connected network node?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getpeerinfo` command provides a range of information about each connected network node, including the peer index, IP address and port, local address, services offered, TLS connection status, peer certificate verification status, and many more details. Let me list them out for you: the peer index (`id`), the IP address and port of the peer (`addr`), the local address (`addrlocal`), the services offered by the peer (`services`), the status of the TLS connection (`tls_established`), the status of the peer certificate verification (`tls_verified`), the time of the last send and receive (`lastsend` and `lastrecv`), the total bytes sent and received (`bytessent` and `bytesrecv`), the connection time (`conntime`), the time offset (`timeoffset`), the ping time and wait (`pingtime` and `pingwait`), the peer version and string version (`version` and `subver`), whether the connection is inbound or outbound (`inbound`), the starting height (block) of the peer (`startingheight`), the ban score (`banscore`), the last header and block we have in common with this peer (`synced_headers` and `synced_blocks`), and the heights of blocks we're currently asking from this peer (`inflight`).\n\n**User:**\nThat's a lot of information! How can I use the `getpeerinfo` command to get information about connected network nodes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `getpeerinfo` command by running `verus getpeerinfo` in the command line, or by using the JSON RPC interface with a tool like `curl`. For example, you can run `verus getpeerinfo` in the command line, or use the following `curl` command:\n\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getpeerinfo\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\nThis will return a JSON array of objects containing information about each connected network node.",
