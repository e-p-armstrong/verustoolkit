    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I'm trying to learn more about the `z_listaddresses` command. What's the purpose of it in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_listaddresses` command returns a list of Sprout and Sapling shielded addresses belonging to the wallet. It's a useful tool for managing your shielded addresses.\n\n**User:**\nOh, that's cool. I saw an optional argument `includeWatchonly` in the `z_listaddresses` command. What does it do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `includeWatchonly` argument is a boolean optional parameter that defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, it will also include watch-only addresses in the list of shielded addresses returned by the command. This can be useful if you want to see all the shielded addresses associated with your wallet, not just the ones you have control over.\n\n**User:**\nGot it! So, how can I actually use the `z_listaddresses` command to get a list of shielded addresses in my wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can use the `z_listaddresses` command in the following way to get a list of shielded addresses in your wallet:\n\n```\nverus z_listaddresses\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `curl` command to send a JSON-RPC request to the Verus node:\n\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_listaddresses\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\nThis will return a JSON array of strings, where each string is a shielded address belonging to the wallet.",
