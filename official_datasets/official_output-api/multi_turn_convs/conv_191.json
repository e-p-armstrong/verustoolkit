    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with the Verus API and I'm trying to understand the `migrate_converttoexport` method. Can you tell me what its purpose is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `migrate_converttoexport` method is used to convert a raw transaction to a cross-chain export. It takes four parameters: `rawTx`, `dest_symbol`, `export_amount`, and returns the finished export transaction, plus the payouts. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, what should I do with the finished export transaction that's returned by `migrate_converttoexport`?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe finished export transaction, plus the payouts, should be passed to the `migrate_createimporttransaction` method on a KMD node to get the corresponding import transaction. Does that answer your question?",
