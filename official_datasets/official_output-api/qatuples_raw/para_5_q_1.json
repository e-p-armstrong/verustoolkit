    "There are two possible results of a successful `submitmergedblock` command:\n\n1. Submission to our chain and PBaaS chains: `{ blockhash: \"hex\", accepted: true, pbaas_submissions: { \"Quantum\":\"chainID_hex\",... } }`\n2. Submission to only PBaaS chains: `{ blockhash: \"hex\", accepted: \"pbaas\", pbaas_submissions: { \"Quantum\":\"chainID_hex\",... } }`",
    "submitmergedblock \"hexdata\" ( \"jsonparametersobject\" ) Attempts to submit one more more new blocks to one or more networks. Each merged block submission may be valid for Verus and/or PBaaS merge mined chains. The submitted block consists of a valid block for this chain, along with embedded headers of other PBaaS merge mined chains. If the hash for this header meets targets of other chains that have been added with 'addmergedblock', this API will submit those blocks to the specified URL endpoints with an RPC 'submitmergedblock' request.
