    "What are the required arguments for the command to merge and send funds, and what do they represent?",
    "The required arguments are:\n\n1. `fromaddresses`: a JSON array of addresses from which to merge and send funds.\n2. `toaddress`: a string representing the t-addr or zaddr to send the funds to.\n\nThese two arguments are required to specify the source and destination of the funds.",
    "Arguments: 1. fromaddresses     (array, required) A JSON array with addresses.             The following special strings are accepted inside the array:               - \"ANY_TADDR\":  Merge UTXOs from any t-addrs belonging to the wallet.               - \"ANY_SPROUT\": Merge notes from any Sprout zaddrs belonging to the wallet.               - \"ANY_SAPLING\": Merge notes from any Sapling zaddrs belonging to the wallet.             While it is possible to use a variety of different combinations of addresses and the above values,             it is not possible to send funds from both sprout and sapling addresses simultaneously. If a special             string is given, any given addresses of that type will be counted as duplicates and cause an error.   [    \"address\"     (string) Can be a t-addr or a zaddr    ,...   ] 2. \"toaddress\"      (string, required) The t-addr or zaddr to send the funds to. 3. fee          (numeric, optional, default=0.0001) The fee amount to attach to this transaction. 4. transparent_limit   (numeric, optional, default=50) Limit on the maximum number of UTXOs to merge. Set to 0 to use node option -mempooltxinputlimit (before Overwinter), or as many as will fit in the transaction (after Overwinter). 5. shielded_limit    (numeric, optional, default=20 Sprout or 200 Sapling Notes) Limit on the maximum number of notes to merge. Set to 0 to merge as many as will fit in the transaction. 6. \"memo\"        (string, optional) Encoded as hex. When toaddress is a zaddr, this will be stored in the memo field of the new note.",
