    "What are the different levels of verbosity for the `getblock` command, and what do they return?",
    "The `getblock` command has three levels of verbosity:\n1. `verbosity = 0`: returns a string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for the block.\n2. `verbosity = 1`: returns a JSON object with information about the block, including its hash, confirmations, size, height, version, merkle root, final Sapling root, transaction IDs, time, nonce, bits, difficulty, previous block hash, and next block hash.\n3. `verbosity = 2`: returns a JSON object with the same information as `verbosity = 1`, but with additional detailed information about each transaction in the block, in the format of the `getrawtransaction` RPC.",
