    "What does the `ping` command measure, in addition to network ping time?",
    "The `ping` command measures not only network ping time but also processing backlog. This is because the ping command is handled in a queue with all other commands.",
    "ping Requests that a ping be sent to all other nodes, to measure ping time. Results provided in getpeerinfo, pingtime and pingwait fields are decimal seconds. Ping command is handled in queue with all other commands, so it measures processing backlog, not just network ping. Examples: > verus ping > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"ping\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
