    "What is the purpose of the `verifyhash` command in Verus?",
    "The `verifyhash` command is used to verify a signed message. It takes four arguments: the address or identity that signed the data, the signature provided by the signer, the hash of the message or file that was signed, and an optional boolean flag to check signature validity based on the latest identity.",
    "verifyhash \"address or identity\" \"signature\" \"hexhash\" \"checklatest\" Verify a signed message Arguments: 1. \"t-addr or identity\" (string, required) The transparent address or identity that signed the data. 2. \"signature\"    (string, required) The signature provided by the signer in base 64 encoding (see signmessage/signfile). 3. \"hexhash\"     (string, required) Hash of the message or file that was signed. 3. \"checklatest\"   (bool, optional)  If true, checks signature validity based on latest identity. defaults to false,                      which determines validity of signing height stored in signature. Result: true|false  (boolean) If the signature is verified or not. Examples: Create the signature > verus signfile \"RNKiEBduBru6Siv1cZRVhp4fkZNyPska6z\" \"filepath/filename\" or > verus signmessage \"RNKiEBduBru6Siv1cZRVhp4fkZNyPska6z\" \"my message\" Verify the signature > verus verifyhash \"RNKiEBduBru6Siv1cZRVhp4fkZNyPska6z\" \"signature\" \"hexhash\" As json rpc > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"verifyhash\", \"params\": [\"RNKiEBduBru6Siv1cZRVhp4fkZNyPska6z\", \"signature\", \"hexhash\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
