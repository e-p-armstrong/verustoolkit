    "You can use the `getchaintxstats` command with a specific number of blocks in the averaging window by passing the number of blocks as an argument. For example:\n\n```\nverus getchaintxstats 2016\n```\n\nThis command will compute the transaction statistics for a window of 2016 blocks.",
    "getchaintxstats Compute statistics about the total number and rate of transactions in the chain. Arguments: 1. nblocks  (numeric, optional) Number of blocks in averaging window. 2. blockhash (string, optional) The hash of the block which ends the window. Result: {  \"time\": xxxxx,             (numeric) The timestamp for the final block in the window in UNIX format.  \"txcount\": xxxxx,           (numeric) The total number of transactions in the chain up to that point.  \"window_final_block_hash\": \"...\",   (string) The hash of the final block in the window.  \"window_block_count\": xxxxx,      (numeric) Size of the window in number of blocks.  \"window_tx_count\": xxxxx,       (numeric) The number of transactions in the window. Only returned if \"window_block_count\" is > 0.  \"window_interval\": xxxxx,       (numeric) The elapsed time in the window in seconds. Only returned if \"window_block_count\" is > 0.  \"txrate\": x.xx,            (numeric) The average rate of transactions per second in the window. Only returned if \"window_interval\" is > 0. } Examples: > verus getchaintxstats > curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getchaintxstats\", \"params\": [2016] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/",
