    "What information does the `getpeerinfo` command provide about each connected network node?",
    "The `getpeerinfo` command provides a range of information about each connected network node, including:\n\n* The peer index (`id`)\n* The IP address and port of the peer (`addr`)\n* The local address (`addrlocal`)\n* The services offered by the peer (`services`)\n* The status of the TLS connection (`tls_established`)\n* The status of the peer certificate verification (`tls_verified`)\n* The time of the last send and receive (`lastsend` and `lastrecv`)\n* The total bytes sent and received (`bytessent` and `bytesrecv`)\n* The connection time (`conntime`)\n* The time offset (`timeoffset`)\n* The ping time and wait (`pingtime` and `pingwait`)\n* The peer version and string version (`version` and `subver`)\n* Whether the connection is inbound or outbound (`inbound`)\n* The starting height (block) of the peer (`startingheight`)\n* The ban score (`banscore`)\n* The last header and block we have in common with this peer (`synced_headers` and `synced_blocks`)\n* The heights of blocks we're currently asking from this peer (`inflight`)",
