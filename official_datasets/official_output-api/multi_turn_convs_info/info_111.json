            "The `z_sendmany` command is used to send multiple transactions from a single address to multiple recipients. It allows you to specify multiple amounts to send, along with the addresses to send them to, and optional memos for each transaction.",
            "z_sendmany \"fromaddress\" [{\"address\":... ,\"amount\":...},...] ( minconf ) ( fee ) Send multiple times. Amounts are decimal numbers with at most 8 digits of precision. Change generated from a taddr flows to a new taddr address, while change generated from a zaddr returns to itself. When sending coinbase UTXOs to a zaddr, change is not allowed. The entire value of the UTXO(s) must be consumed. Before Sapling activates, the maximum number of zaddr outputs is 54 due to transaction size limits. Arguments: 1. \"fromaddress\"     (string, required) The taddr or zaddr to send the funds from. 2. \"amounts\"       (array, required) An array of json objects representing the amounts to send.   [{    \"address\":address (string, required) The address is a taddr or zaddr    \"amount\":amount  (numeric, required) The numeric amount in KMD is the value    \"memo\":memo    (string, optional) If the address is a zaddr, raw data represented in hexadecimal string format   }, ... ] 3. minconf        (numeric, optional, default=1) Only use funds confirmed at least this many times. 4. fee          (numeric, optional, default=0.0001) The fee amount to attach to this transaction. Result: \"operationid\"     (string) An operationid to pass to z_getoperationstatus to get the result of the operation.
