    "# VerusPay\n\nVerusPay represents a sophisticated blockchain payment platform within the Verus ecosystem, designed to facilitate the creation, management, and processing of invoices utilizing blockchain technology. Through the introduction of the VerusPay Invoice specification in VerusPay v3, it standardizes the format for invoices, ensuring interoperability, security, and ease of use across different blockchain systems. This specification enables users to include detailed transaction information such as payment amounts, destinations, and requested currencies, as well as to handle conversions and accept payments from various [PBaaS](/blockchains/) blockchains. Notably, it supports packaging these invoices into deeplinks and QR codes, making them easily accessible and usable within the Verus Mobile wallet and potentially other applications. This functionality opens up a wide array of possibilities for merchants, developers, and users within the Verus network and beyond, offering a seamless payment experience across different blockchain ecosystems.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use VerusPay in your own application or service, refer to the [verusid-ts-client helper library.](https://github.com/VerusCoin/verusid-ts-client/tree/master)",
