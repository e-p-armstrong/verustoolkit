    "What is the maximum TPS (transactions-per-second) that Verus can achieve?",
    "Verus doesn't have a maximum TPS metric. Because Verus is an open fractal network, its scalability is practically unlimited, and its TPS can grow indefinitely as more chains are added to the network. A single PBaaS chain can reach between 75 and 800 TPS, and a network of several thousand chains would have a total bandwidth of 1 million+ TPS.",
    "* **No programming needed for [blockchain](/blockchains/), [token and currency launches](/currencies/)**\n* **Low protocol fees**## Scalability\nVerus achieves practically unlimited scalability through its [Public Blockchains as a Service](/blockchains/). Verus PBaaS enables the provisioning of an unlimited number of independent, interoperable and interconnected L1 blockchains, which inherit all Verus L1 features.Verus' scale out TPS (transactions-per-second) is better than what other blockchains have today. A single PBaaS chain can reach between 75 and 800 TPS depending on blocktime; a network of several thousand chains would have a total bandwidth of 1 million+ TPS. But there is no maximum TPS metric because such a thing does not exist on an open fractal network like Verus.* **Create use case specific blockchains and currencies** \n* **Move activity between chains to avoid congestion**## Security\nVerus and its PBaaS-blockchains are 51% hash attack resistant. All functionality can be found in the consensus layer (L1), making the protocol secure for developers and users. No smart contract risks \u2014 Verus uses smart transactions, not smart contracts.* **51% hash attack resistant through [Verus Proof of Power](/overview/verus-proof-of-power/)**\n* Read: [Verus Smart Transactions vs. Smart Contracts](https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-smart-transactions-vs-smart-contracts-f98079c00ed0)## Interoperability\nVerus enables a world where all blockchains communicate with each other. All PBaaS-chains are interoperable and interconnected. Verus and all PBaaS-chains are now also connected to Ethereum, in a trustless and non-custodial way.* Read: [Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) \u2014 Provable, Decentralized Cross-chain Communication](https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-internet-protocol-vip-provable-decentralized-cross-chain-communication-8d9414a429c5)\n* [Verus-Ethereum Bridge](/eth-bridge/)",
