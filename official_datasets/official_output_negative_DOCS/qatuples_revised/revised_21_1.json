    "Can I receive more than 60 VRSC as a referral reward for each VerusID creation?",
    "No, that's not possible. The referral system only goes three levels down, and the maximum referral reward you can receive is 60 VRSC per VerusID creation, if you have three identities stringed together through referrals.",
    "## Costs\n**On the Verus blockchain** a VerusID costs 100 VRSC. These costs can be discounted with referrals. All costs paid are going to the [miners and stakers of the ecosystem](/economy/) and to the referrals if used.| | VerusID Cost |\n| :----------------------- | --: | \n| **Base cost** | 100 VRSC | \n| **Cost with referral used** | 80 VRSC |### Referrals\nA referral system is implemented to reward users with identities. For each VerusID a user creates, the referral identity receives 20 VRSC. The referral system goes three levels down.If one owns three identities that are stringed together through its referrals, one can receive 60 VRSC with each VerusID creation. This way an identity only has to cost 20 VRSC.::: tip Support the Verus Vision\nUse ``Verus Coin Foundation@`` when creating a VerusID on the Verus blockchain.
