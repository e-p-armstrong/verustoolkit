    "# Network Economy\nVerus is a rent-free blockchain protocol that has a decentralized economy. Costs for services paid to the protocol are distributed to the miners and stakers. There are no developer fees, and no rent-seeking profiteers.## Mining Ecosystem\nVerus has a naturally decentralized miner ecosystem. VerusHash 2.2 is the mining algorithm that is specifically developed for Verus. The algorithm equalizes mining fairness across hardware classes.To mine Verus no specialized mining equipment is necessary. Anyone can start mining with consumer-grade hardware. Mining is made especially easy for starters, since they can start directly from within Verus Desktop, without any additional software requirements. [Start mining](/economy/start-mining.html).### Merge Mining\nAdditionally, when PBaaS goes live on mainnet, miners can choose to mine up to 22 PBaaS-chains simultaneously, without losing any of their original hashing power.## Staking Ecosystem\nAnyone can start staking Verus, even with the smallest amount possible, e.g. `0.00000001 VRSC`. Although it could take many years before you win a block with such a tiny amount.Verus has a powerful and fair staking system. No threshold required and no registrations necessary. [Start staking](/economy/start-staking.html).## Block Rewards\nMiners and stakers are rewarded for their efforts to keep the network secure. They earn block rewards.
