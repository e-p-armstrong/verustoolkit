    "Can you explain why Verus requires expensive blockchain developers and infrastructure to launch a new blockchain or token?",
    "Actually, Verus is a rent-free protocol that allows for low-cost, rapid, and easy deployment of blockchains, tokens, liquidity pools, identities, and more without requiring any coding knowledge or expensive developers. Simple API commands are all that's needed to get started, saving users money on infrastructure and development costs.",
    "# Introduction to VerusWelcome to the Verus documentation. Here you find all mainnet and testnet protocol features and implementations. The documentation will be updated continuously.## Open-source, rent-free, scalable public infrastructure\nVerus is an open-source, [fairly launched](/overview/#fair-launch), decentralized blockchain protocol with proof-of-work and proof-of-stake as its consensus mechanism. It offers rent-free blockchain tools for creators and organizations to build products, services and systems.Verus is a multichain protocol with strong focus on scalability, security and decentralization. It can scale to world demand, is proven 51% hash attack resistant and is community built - all coins in circulation are fairly mined and staked.With Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) anyone can launch scalable, fully interoperable, customizable and independent blockchains for public or private use. Launch tokens & basket currencies (e.g. liquidity pools) on top of blockchains for any use case. Get funding and create markets with protocol level built-in DeFi and smart launch options.Protocol-level self-sovereign digital identities and namespaces ([VerusID](/verusid/)) are at the center of the Verus multichain protocol. Giving builders, communities, businesses and organizations tools never before seen.Everything happening on the Verus multichain protocol has aligned incentives with the [miners and stakers](/economy/) of the worldwide network. This makes it one of the most secure protocols with opportunities to earn.## Low-cost, rapid & easy deployment\nLaunch blockchains, tokens, liquidity pools, identities and much more without any coding needed, just simple API commands. Save money on expensive blockchain (Solidity) developers & infrastructure with the rent-free Verus Protocol.",
