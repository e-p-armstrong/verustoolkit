    "Can I start staking with Verus without running a full node?",
    "No, you cannot start staking with Verus without running a full node. One of the rules for solo staking is that a full node is required, which can be achieved by running Verus Desktop in native mode.",
    "# Staking\n\nStaking is accessible for everyone. Use Verus holdings to secure the network. It does not matter how much $VRSC you have, there are no minimum requirements to start staking.\n\nOn the Verus blockchain UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) are staking, not balances. A large UTXO has more chances of winning a block than a small UTXO. [What is a UTXO?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0UYZ9hDos)\n\n## Solo staking\nThere are a few rules you need to know before you can start staking.\n\n| Rules | \n| :-----|\n| Wallet Running | \n| Full Node Required (native mode in Verus Desktop) | \n| Staking Enabled | \n| UTXO Eligible After 150 Blocks | \n| Minimum of 0.00000001 VRSC in Wallet |\n\nWith solo staking you either win a full block or you win nothing.\n\n::: warning Need help with staking? \ud83d\udcb0\n[Join the Verus Discord #staking channel.
