    "Can you explain why option 1 is only used for decentralized currencies?",
    "Option 1 is not only used for decentralized currencies. In fact, a currency with option 1 can be launched either centralized or decentralized. This option allows the currency to have reserves and be convertible to and from those reserves, making it a \"Basket currency\". The level of decentralization is determined by the \"proofprotocol\" parameter, not by option 1.",
    "| Options # | Details |\n| -: |:-----|\n| 1 | The currency has reserves, and can be converted to and from the reserves (option 32 needs to be added). Can have one currency as its reserves, or multiple with up to 10 currencies. This is a \u201cBasket currency\u201d \u2014 a currency with a basket of reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized. |\n| 2 | Only the controlling VerusID (the namespace of the currency, the rootID) can create subIDs. |\n| 8 | Referrals and discounts are enabled for subID creation. |\n| 16 | Referrals are required for subID creation. |\n| 32 | The currency is a simple token currency without any reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized. This option is also used for [Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens](/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth). |\n| 2048 | A single satoshi (0.00000001) NFT token is created & has tokenized control of the root VerusID. Which means you can send the single satoshi token to other addresses and then they have control of the root VerusID. |Let\u2019s give some examples of combined options:\n- ``\"options\":33`` \u2014 this launches a basket currency. It is options 1 + 32 combined.\n- ``\"options\":2080`` \u2014 this launches a single satoshi token that has control of the root VerusID. It is options 32 + 2048 combined.\n- ``\"options\":35`` \u2014 this launches a basket currency, and only the rootID can create subIDs. It is options 1 + 2 + 32 combined.## Defining parameters\nNext up are the parameters. Choose the parameters wisely to launch a currency that suits any need. Not all parameters are needed or combinable. There are many to go through, so let\u2019s start.### **\"proofprotocol\"**\nThis parameter defines, among others, if the currency is centralized or decentralized. You can choose 1,2 or 3.",
