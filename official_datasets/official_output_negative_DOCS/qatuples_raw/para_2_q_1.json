    "Does the protocol distribute the entire fee pool to miners and stakers with each new block?",
    "No, the protocol does not distribute the entire fee pool to miners and stakers with each new block. Instead, 1% of the fee pool is added on top of the block rewards with each new block. This means that the fee pool is not depleted with each block, but rather, it continues to grow, and a small portion of it is distributed to miners and stakers as an incentive.",
    "## Fee Pool\nAll the fees generated by the protocol are collected in the ``fee pool``. With each new block, ``1%`` of the fee pool is added on top of the block rewards. It is expected that fees outnumber block rewards, making mining and staking in the Verus ecosystem a profitable and competitive endeavor.",
