    "Is the supply of Bridge.vETH fixed at 100,000?",
    "No, the supply of Bridge.vETH is not fixed at 100,000. It is dynamic and can change over time. Bridge.vETH gets minted when people convert VRSC, ETH, DAI, or MKR to Bridge.vETH, and it gets burned when they convert from Bridge.vETH back to VRSC, ETH, DAI, or MKR.",

Dai in Bridge.vETH and in the complete Verus ecosystem get this savings rate. The DSR is being passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH.|\n| **.vETH subID registrations**| A .vETH subID costs 0.01 vETH worth of Bridge.vETH. When registering the subID the Bridge.vETH is burned, meaning the Bridge.vETH supply decreases. |\n| **Conversion fees**| 50% of the conversion fees go into the reserves of Bridge.vETH: 0.025% when it's a reserve to reserve conversion, 0.0125% when it's a reserve to Bridge.vETH conversion (or vice versa). |\n| **Cross-chain send fees**| A share of the cross-chain send fees go into the reserves of Bridge.vETH. |Bridge.vETH had an initial supply of 100,000. During the preconversion timeframe which lasted 10 days, anyone could add VRSC, ETH, DAI and MKR into its reserves. When the preconversion period ended everyone got their share of the 100,000 Bridge.vETH, distributed by the protocol.The supply of Bridge.vETH is dynamic. The currency gets minted when people convert VRSC, ETH, DAI or MKR to Bridge.vETH, and the currency gets burned when they convert from Bridge.vETH back to VRSC, ETH, DAI or MKR.Converting currencies using Bridge.vETH (or other basket currencies) has many advantages. It is MEV-resistant, has no smart contract risks due to protocol level security and has low fees (max. 0.05%).
