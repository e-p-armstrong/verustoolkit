    "What happens to the subID registration fees when creating a decentralized currency with the `options` parameter set to `1`?",
    "When creating a decentralized currency with the `options` parameter set to `1`, the subID registration fees are burned.",
    "``1`` is default, which launches a decentralized currency (no need to include this parameter when defining such a currency). When subIDs are created with this option, the registration fees are burned.``2`` is for a centralized currency. If it\u2019s a basket currency the rootID can mint and burn supply while automatically lowering and raising the reserve ratio (also anyone can burn supply without lowering the reserve ratio). Or when it\u2019s a simple token currency they can just mint and burn supply. The subID registration fees go to the rootID.``3`` is for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens.

In the case of a simple token currency, combine it with `\"conversions\"` to determine the preconversion price.Use up to 10 currencies for this parameter.",
