    "What is the main difference between solo staking and pool staking?",
    "The main difference is not that pool staking is more secure, but rather that with solo staking, you either win a full block or you win nothing, whereas with pool staking, the rewards are shared among the pool participants. Additionally, with pool staking, you can choose to keep control over your funds using VerusID or trust your funds with a pool operator.",
    "# Staking\n\nStaking is accessible for everyone. Use Verus holdings to secure the network. It does not matter how much $VRSC you have, there are no minimum requirements to start staking.\n\nOn the Verus blockchain UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) are staking, not balances. A large UTXO has more chances of winning a block than a small UTXO. [What is a UTXO?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0UYZ9hDos)\n\n## Solo staking\nThere are a few rules you need to know before you can start staking.\n\n| Rules | \n| :-----|\n| Wallet Running | \n| Full Node Required (native mode in Verus Desktop) | \n| Staking Enabled | \n| UTXO Eligible After 150 Blocks | \n| Minimum of 0.00000001 VRSC in Wallet |\n\nWith solo staking you either win a full block or you win nothing.\n\n::: warning Need help with staking? \ud83d\udcb0\n[Join the Verus Discord #staking channel.
