    "What happens if I fill in the current blockheight under \"unlockatblock\" when requesting an unlock?",
    "You shouldn't fill in the current blockheight under \"unlockatblock\" when requesting an unlock. Instead, you should fill in the current blockheight minus 1. This is because the \"unlockatblock\" parameter specifies the block at which the unlock should be effective, and if you fill in the current blockheight, the unlock will not be immediate. It's recommended to fill in 0 to request an immediate unlock.",
    "To request an unlock you need to know the blockheight of the blockchain. Under ``unlockatblock`` you can fill in whatever the current blockheight is minus 1. So if the blockheight is at 1,000,000 you can fill in ``999999`` or just ``0`` (recommended) to immediately request an unlock.\n\n``` json\nrun setidentitytimelock \"myid@\" \n'{\n  \"unlockatblock\":0\n}'\n```\n\nYou can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs.",
