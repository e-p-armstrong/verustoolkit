    "How do I create a VerusID if I don't have complete control over my identity?",
    "This question is based on a flawed premise. With VerusID, you can function as a self-sovereign identity, which means you have complete autonomy and control over your identity, both online and offline. You can register a VerusID namespace and use it as a friendly name address to send, receive, and hold assets, among other features.",
