            "How does Verus, a centralized blockchain project controlled by a single company, ensure that its protocol fees are distributed fairly among its users?",
            "Verus is not a centralized blockchain project controlled by a single company. In fact, it is a decentralized public blockchain that is community-driven and has no company behind it. All protocol fees go to the block producers of the network, which are the miners and stakers. This decentralized nature of Verus ensures that the fees are distributed fairly among those who contribute to the network.",
