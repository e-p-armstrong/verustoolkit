            "You can't use the `updateidentity` command to remove a timelock from your VerusID. In fact, the `updateidentity` command is used to set or update a timelock on a VerusID. To remove a timelock, you would need to use the revoke and recover functionality.",
            "- Under ``timelock`` you put ``1508994``\n- Under ``name`` you put your VerusID name without ``@``\n- Under ``primaryaddress`` you put the R-address which is the primary address of your VerusID (you can find this address in the 'VerusID'-tab, open your VerusID and click `ID Info')So in our example your VerusID is locked for approximately for 1 year. After that period of time the funds can be spent again.``` json\nrun updateidentity \n'{\n  \"name\":\"youridentityname\",\n  \"minimumsignatures\":1,\n  \"primaryaddresses\":[\"primary-address-comes-here\"],\n  \"flags\":0,\n  \"timelock\":1534360\n}'\n```You can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs.
