            "VerusID's signature system actually creates unforgable signatures. This means that once a signature is created, it cannot be altered or replicated by anyone else. The protocol allows for the verification of these signatures for free.",
            "## Signatures\nCreate unforgable, verifiable signatures with VerusID. Sign files, hashes and messages. Use the protocol to verify those signatures for free.\n\n## Multisig\nMultiple VerusIDs can have spending or signing ability of one VerusID. This means that multiple organizations or people can manage a VerusID.\n\n## Messages\nSend private messages to VerusIDs.",
