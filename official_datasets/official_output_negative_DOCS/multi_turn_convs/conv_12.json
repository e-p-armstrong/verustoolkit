    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about creating a VerusID, but I'm not sure about some of the settings. Why is it important to carefully consider the assignment of `RevokeID` and `RecoveryID` when creating a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! It's indeed crucial to carefully consider the assignment of `RevokeID` and `RecoveryID` when creating a VerusID. The reason is that these settings determine the level of control and recoverability you have over your identity.\n\nFor instance, assigning a `RecoveryID` to `self` when the `RevokeID` is assigned to another identity would prevent recovery of the identity after revocation. This could lead to unintended consequences, such as losing access to your identity or assets.\n\nBy carefully considering the assignment of `RevokeID` and `RecoveryID`, you can ensure that you achieve the desired level of control and recoverability for your VerusID. It's essential to think about who should have the power to revoke or recover your identity, and to set up the permissions accordingly. Do you have any other questions about creating a VerusID or managing permissions?",

            "When creating a VerusID users can assign a ``RevokeID`` and a ``RecoveryID`` to their VerusID. They can be the same identities, different ones or appointed ``self``. These assigned identities are also VerusIDs and thus must be purchased.| Action | Outcome |\n| :----------------------- | :-- | \n| Revoking | Funds can not be spent anymore | \n| Recovering | Recover all assets to a new address.
