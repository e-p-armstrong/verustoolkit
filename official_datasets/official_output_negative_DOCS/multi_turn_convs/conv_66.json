    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to learn more about PBaaS chains and how they interact with the Verus daemon. Can you tell me how they operate independently of the Verus daemon?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, all PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, which means they don't operate independently of it. They can be part of the Verus community and contribute to improving the daemon. By doing so, they get a complete, multi-currency, VerusID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. Would you like to know more about how PBaaS chains work with the Verus daemon?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I had another question, can a VerusID owner define basket currencies with no reserves backing the currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a VerusID owner can define basket currencies with one or more reserves backing the currency, at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. This ensures that the basket currency is always backed by some amount of reserve currency. Does that clarify things for you?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about DeFi protocols and I had a question about how Verus DeFi protocol addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. I thought it did so by giving miners and stakers a portion of the block reward?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not how Verus DeFi protocol addresses MEV and front-running. Instead, it ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular basket currency, and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers. This approach helps to mitigate the issues of MEV and front-running in a different way. Would you like me to explain more about how Verus DeFi protocol addresses these issues?",
