    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get a better understanding of currencies in Verus. What's the recommended limit for currency supplies in Verus, and how many decimal places does it have?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe recommended absolute limit for all currency supplies in Verus is 10 billion (-1 SATOSHI), which has 8 decimal places (9999999999.99999999). This is the maximum supply you should aim for when creating a new currency.\n\n**User:**\nI see. But can I create a currency supply with more than 10 billion units in Verus if I need to?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the recommended absolute limit for all currency supplies in Verus is 10 billion (-1 SATOSHI). It's not recommended to create a currency supply with more than 10 billion units. Verus is designed to work within this limit, and exceeding it may cause issues.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. How do I define a new currency in Verus with an unlimited supply, then?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can't define a new currency in Verus with an unlimited supply. The recommended absolute limit for all currency supplies in Verus is 10 billion (-1 SATOSHI). You can define a new currency with a specific supply using the `definecurrency` command, but it should be within the recommended limit. Unlimited supplies are not supported in Verus.",
