    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how fees are handled in the Verus ecosystem. What happens to the fees generated by the protocol if they are not collected in the fee pool?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe fees generated by the protocol are indeed collected in the fee pool. There is no scenario where fees are not collected in the fee pool. According to the protocol's design, all fees are collected in the fee pool, and with each new block, 1% of the fee pool is added on top of the block rewards.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. So, does the protocol distribute the entire fee pool to miners and stakers with each new block?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the protocol does not distribute the entire fee pool to miners and stakers with each new block. Instead, 1% of the fee pool is added on top of the block rewards with each new block. This means that the fee pool is not depleted with each block, but rather, it continues to grow, and a small portion of it is distributed to miners and stakers as an incentive.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I was wondering, are block rewards higher than fees in the Verus ecosystem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, according to the protocol's design, it is expected that fees will outnumber block rewards, making mining and staking in the Verus ecosystem a profitable and competitive endeavor.",
