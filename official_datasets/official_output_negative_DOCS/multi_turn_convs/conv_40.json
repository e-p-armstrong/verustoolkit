    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring the Verus ecosystem and I'm curious about VerusPay. What is the purpose of the VerusPay Invoice specification?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusPay Invoice specification is designed to be universally implementable across various programming languages and blockchain ecosystems, focusing on serialization and deserialization processes to ensure interoperability and consistency, making it a valuable tool for developers, merchants, and users within and beyond the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering about the **Version** component in the VerusPay Invoice construct. What's its purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe **Version** component in the VerusPay Invoice construct manages the invoice format version, facilitating future updates and backward compatibility through version flags and checks. It does not restrict the invoice to a specific version, as you might have implied.\n\n**User:**\nI was under the impression that VerusPay invoices only had two components: **System ID** and **Signing ID**. Am I mistaken?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you are mistaken. VerusPay invoices are not limited to only two components: **System ID** and **Signing ID**. The VerusPay Invoice construct includes four core components: **System ID**, **Signing ID**, **Signature**, and **Details**, as well as a **Version** component. The **Details** component further incorporates the VerusPay InvoiceDetails sub-component, which provides specific transaction-related data.",
