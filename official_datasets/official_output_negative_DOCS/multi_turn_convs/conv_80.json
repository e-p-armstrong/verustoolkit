    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about staking rewards using Verus Desktop. Is there a way to divert my staking rewards to the same wallet I'm staking with?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no, it's not possible to divert staking rewards to the same wallet using Verus Desktop. Instead, you can divert staking rewards to a different wallet, specifically a hot wallet, by setting up custom native mode launch options on the staking device.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a bit of a bummer. Does that mean I need multiple devices to divert staking rewards to a different wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, that's correct. You'll need two devices: a staking device and a hot wallet device. The staking device is where the funds are secured with Vault, and the hot wallet device is where you want your won stakes to arrive.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. So, I set up the custom native mode launch options on the staking device... what if I forget to click the \"Save Changes\" button?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you don't click the \"Save Changes\" button, the changes you made to the custom native mode launch options will not be saved, and your stakes will not be diverted to your hot wallet. So, make sure to click that button to save your changes!",

Let's explain how you can divert your won stakes to a different wallet with Verus Desktop.\n\nWe have two devices with two different wallets:\n- Your staking device\n- Your hot wallet device\n\n### Hot wallet\nThe hot wallet is the device you want your stakes to arrive on.

Then click the three-dots next to the address you want to use. Click ``Copy public key`` as seen in the image below. Paste and save this somewhere, we will need it later.\n\n![image-pubkey](/images/copy-pubkey.png)\n\n### Staking device\nThis device is staking happily, and your funds are secured with the Vault ([read here how to set up](/guides/setup-vault/)). Let's make sure your won stakes are sent to your hot wallet device.\n\nGo to ``settings`` (the cogwheel top right corner), then select ``Profile Settings`` (default). Here you see the option ``Custom native mode launch options``. Select ``Verus``.\n\nFirst copy and paste the code from below into the textfield and click ``Add launch option``.\n\n```\nminetolocalwallet=0\n```\n\nNext, copy and paste the code below. Change ``xxx`` to the ``public key`` we have from the hot wallet. Click ``Add launch option``.\n```\npubkey=xxx\n```\n\nAt last, click the ``Save Changes`` button. **Don't forget this step!** Now close the wallet and open it again.
