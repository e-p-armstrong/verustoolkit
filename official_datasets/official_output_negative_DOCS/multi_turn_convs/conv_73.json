There doesn't seem to be a guide anywhere.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! Actually, there is a guide for getting a Verus address, which is often referred to as setting up a wallet. You can find the guide by searching for \"Verus Wallet setup\" or \"Getting a Verus address\". It should walk you through the process step-by-step. If you're still having trouble, feel free to ask and I can try to assist you further.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I've got my wallet set up. Now I'm trying to connect my Verus account to the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. Do you know how I can do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, there is no guide for connecting a Verus account to the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. However, there is a guide for claiming refunds from the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. You might want to check that out. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, I'm here to help.",
