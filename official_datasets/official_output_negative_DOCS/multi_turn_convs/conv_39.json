    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking at the destination types in Verus, and I'm a bit confused about `DEST_INVALID (0)`. What's its purpose, and why is it used for transactions to a public key?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, `DEST_INVALID (0)` doesn't represent a public key destination. Instead, it represents an invalid or unspecified destination type, used as a default or error state. It's not used for transactions to a public key; for that, you would use `DEST_PK (1)`, which indicates a public key destination.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been wondering about `DEST_ETH (9)`. Is that used for quantum-resistant addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, `DEST_ETH (9)` is not used for quantum-resistant addresses. It specifies an Ethereum account as the destination, facilitating cross-chain transactions with Ethereum. For quantum-resistant addresses, you would use `DEST_QUANTUM (7)`.\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing I'm unclear about is the `FLAG_DEST_AUX (64)` flag. How is it used to indicate that a destination is associated with a gateway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `FLAG_DEST_AUX (64)` flag is not used to indicate that a destination is associated with a gateway. Instead, it indicates the presence of auxiliary destinations, allowing for the specification of additional destinations within a single Transfer Destination construct! The `FLAG_DEST_GATEWAY (128)` flag is used to specify that the destination is associated with a gateway, relevant for cross-chain transactions or interactions with external systems.",
