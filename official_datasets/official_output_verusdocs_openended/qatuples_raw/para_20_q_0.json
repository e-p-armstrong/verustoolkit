    "What are the key benefits of using Verus, including its scalability, security, and interoperability features?",
    "Verus offers several key benefits that make it an attractive solution for blockchain and cryptocurrency development. These benefits can be categorized into three main areas: scalability, security, and interoperability.\n\n**Scalability:**\nVerus achieves practically unlimited scalability through its Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) feature. This allows for the creation of an unlimited number of independent, interoperable, and interconnected Layer 1 (L1) blockchains, each inheriting all Verus L1 features. This means that Verus can scale out transactions per second (TPS) to reach high levels, with a single PBaaS chain capable of reaching between 75 and 800 TPS depending on block time. Moreover, a network of several thousand chains would have a total bandwidth of 1 million+ TPS, making Verus highly scalable.\n\n**Security:**\nVerus and its PBaaS blockchains are 51% hash attack resistant, thanks to its Verus Proof of Power consensus algorithm. This ensures that the protocol is secure for both developers and users. Additionally, Verus uses smart transactions instead of smart contracts, which eliminates the risks associated with smart contracts.\n\n**Interoperability:**\nVerus enables a world where all blockchains can communicate with each other seamlessly. All PBaaS chains are interoperable and interconnected, allowing for the free flow of data and assets between them. Furthermore, Verus and all PBaaS chains are connected to Ethereum in a trustless and non-custodial way, thanks to the Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) and the Verus-Ethereum Bridge. This enables decentralized cross-chain communication and opens up new possibilities for blockchain-based applications.\n\nOverall, Verus offers a powerful solution for blockchain and cryptocurrency development, with its scalability, security, and interoperability features making it an attractive choice for developers and users alike.",
    "* **No programming needed for [blockchain](/blockchains/), [token and currency launches](/currencies/)**\n* **Low protocol fees**## Scalability\nVerus achieves practically unlimited scalability through its [Public Blockchains as a Service](/blockchains/). Verus PBaaS enables the provisioning of an unlimited number of independent, interoperable and interconnected L1 blockchains, which inherit all Verus L1 features.Verus' scale out TPS (transactions-per-second) is better than what other blockchains have today. A single PBaaS chain can reach between 75 and 800 TPS depending on blocktime; a network of several thousand chains would have a total bandwidth of 1 million+ TPS. But there is no maximum TPS metric because such a thing does not exist on an open fractal network like Verus.* **Create use case specific blockchains and currencies** \n* **Move activity between chains to avoid congestion**## Security\nVerus and its PBaaS-blockchains are 51% hash attack resistant. All functionality can be found in the consensus layer (L1), making the protocol secure for developers and users. No smart contract risks \u2014 Verus uses smart transactions, not smart contracts.* **51% hash attack resistant through [Verus Proof of Power](/overview/verus-proof-of-power/)**\n* Read: [Verus Smart Transactions vs. Smart Contracts](https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-smart-transactions-vs-smart-contracts-f98079c00ed0)## Interoperability\nVerus enables a world where all blockchains communicate with each other. All PBaaS-chains are interoperable and interconnected.
