    "What are the costs and structure of a VerusID on the Verus blockchain?",
    "On the Verus blockchain, a VerusID costs 100 VRSC, which is the base cost. However, this cost can be discounted with referrals. All costs paid are distributed to the miners and stakers of the ecosystem and to the referrals if used. \n\nWhen a referral is used, the cost of a VerusID decreases to 80 VRSC. The referral system is designed to reward users with identities. For each VerusID a user creates, the referral identity receives 20 VRSC. The referral system goes three levels down, allowing users to receive up to 60 VRSC with each VerusID creation, reducing the cost of a VerusID to just 20 VRSC.\n\nAs for the structure of a VerusID, it consists of several components:\n\n1. **VerusID Name**: A unique namespace and human-readable cryptocurrency address.\n2. **Primary Address**: The owner of the VerusID, containing the private key. It can contain more than one VerusID.\n3. **Identity Address**: The identifier of the VerusID, along with the name.\n4. **Private Address**: An optional attached private z-address.\n5. **Revocation Authority**: The identity address that can revoke the VerusID.\n6. **Recovery Authority**: The identity address that can recover the VerusID.\n7. **Contentmap**: VDXF key/value data.\n\nAdditionally, when creating a VerusID on the Verus blockchain, users can support the Verus vision by using ``Verus Coin Foundation@`` as their referral, with all proceeds going towards further development of the Verus vision.",

The referral system goes three levels down.If one owns three identities that are stringed together through its referrals, one can receive 60 VRSC with each VerusID creation.
