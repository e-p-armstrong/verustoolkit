    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    **User:**

    I''ve been exploring VerusID and I''m curious to know more about its features
    and capabilities. Can you tell me some of the key features and how they can be
    used in various scenarios?


    **AI Assistant:**

    VerusID is a powerful decentralized identity system that offers several features
    that enable secure and flexible management of digital identities. Let me highlight
    three notable features: signatures, multisig, and messaging.


    **Signatures:**

    VerusID allows users to create unforgable and verifiable signatures for files,
    hashes, and messages. These signatures are tamper-evident and can be verified
    for free using the Verus protocol. This feature ensures the authenticity and integrity
    of digital data, enabling trustless transactions and interactions.


    Imagine a scenario where a company wants to ensure the authenticity of a digital
    document. With VerusID signatures, the company can create a signature that verifies
    the document''s integrity, ensuring that it hasn''t been tampered with. This feature
    is particularly useful in industries like finance, healthcare, and government,
    where data integrity is critical.


    **Multisig:**

    The multisig feature of VerusID enables multiple VerusIDs to have spending or
    signing abilities for a single VerusID. This means that multiple organizations
    or individuals can jointly manage a VerusID, enabling collaborative decision-making
    and secure asset management. Multisig provides an additional layer of security
    and flexibility, as it requires the consent of multiple parties to perform actions
    on a VerusID.


    For example, a group of investors can use multisig to jointly manage a cryptocurrency
    fund. Each investor can have a VerusID that is part of the multisig setup, ensuring
    that no single individual can make decisions without the consent of the others.


    **Messages:**

    VerusID also enables users to send private messages to other VerusIDs. This feature
    ensures secure and private communication between parties, protecting sensitive
    information from unauthorized access. Private messaging is essential for various
    use cases, such as business negotiations, personal communications, or confidential
    data sharing.


    In a business setting, VerusID messaging can be used to negotiate deals or share
    confidential information between parties. The encryption and security features
    of VerusID messaging ensure that sensitive information remains private and secure.


    In summary, VerusID''s features provide a robust and secure platform for managing
    digital identities, enabling secure transactions, collaborative decision-making,
    and private communication. These capabilities have numerous applications in various
    industries, including finance, healthcare, and government.
