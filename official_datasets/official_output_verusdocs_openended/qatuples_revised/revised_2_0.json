    "Explain how to update a VerusID to add a lock, and then unlock it, using the Verus Desktop command line interface?",
    "To update a VerusID to add a lock, you can use the `updateidentity` command in the Verus Desktop command line interface. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\nYou can copy and paste the following code snippet into the command line interface of Verus Desktop, and then edit the necessary inputs for your needs:\n```json\nrun updateidentity \n'{ \n  \"name\":\"youridentityname\",\n  \"minimumsignatures\":1,\n  \"primaryaddresses\":[\"primary-address-comes-here\"],\n  \"flags\":2,\n  \"timelock\":10080\n  }'\n```\nIn this code snippet, you need to replace `\"youridentityname\"` with the name of your VerusID, and `\"primary-address-comes-here\"` with your primary address. The `\"flags\"` property is set to 2, which indicates that a lock is being added. The `\"timelock\"` property specifies the number of blocks that need to pass before the lock can be removed.\n\nOnce the lock is added, you will not be able to spend the funds associated with your VerusID until the predetermined number of blocks has passed.\n\nTo unlock your VerusID, you can use a similar `updateidentity` command, but with the `\"flags\"` property set to 0:\n```json\nrun updateidentity \n'{ \n  \"name\":\"youridentityname\",\n  \"minimumsignatures\":1,\n  \"primaryaddresses\":[\"primary-address-comes-here\"],\n  \"flags\":0\n  }'\n```\nAgain, you need to replace `\"youridentityname\"` with the name of your VerusID, and `\"primary-address-comes-here\"` with your primary address. After running this command, you will need to wait for the predetermined number of blocks to pass before you can spend the funds associated with your VerusID again.\n\nIt's worth noting that you can always revoke and recover a locked VerusID if needed.",
    "``` json\nrun updateidentity \n'{ \n  \"name\":\"youridentityname\",\n  \"minimumsignatures\":1,\n  \"primaryaddresses\":[\"primary-address-comes-here\"],\n  \"flags\":2,\n  \"timelock\":10080\n  }'\n```\n\nYou can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs. In the code snippet are the minimum requirements to update your VerusID with a lock.\n\n:::tip Revoke & Recover\nRemember: you can always revoke and recover a locked VerusID.\n:::\n\n### Request an unlock\nAbove you locked a VerusID with a DelayLock. Now let's request an unlock. When an unlock has been requested you have to wait the predetermined number of blocks before you can spend the funds again.\n\nFill in your VerusID ``name``, the ``primary address`` and set ``flags`` to 0. Now you only have to wait for your predetermined number of blocks (10,080 in our example) to run out so you can spend the funds again.\n\n``` json\nrun updateidentity \n'{ \n  \"name\":\"youridentityname\",\n  \"minimumsignatures\":1,\n  \"primaryaddresses\":[\"primary-address-comes-here\"],\n  \"flags\":0\n  }'\n```\n\nYou can copy and paste this code snippet into the commandline interface of Verus Desktop and edit the necessary inputs for your needs. In the code snippet are the minimum requirements to unlock your VerusID.",
