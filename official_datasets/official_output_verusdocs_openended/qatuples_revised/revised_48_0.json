    "What are the requirements and options for staking on the Verus blockchain, and how does it work?",
    "Staking is a way to secure the Verus network and earn rewards by using your Verus holdings. Anyone can participate in staking, regardless of the amount of VRSC they hold, as there are no minimum requirements to start staking.\n\nOn the Verus blockchain, it's not the balance that's staking, but rather the Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). A larger UTXO has a higher chance of winning a block than a smaller one. To clarify, a UTXO is an unspent transaction output that is available to be used as input for a new transaction.\n\nThere are two main ways to stake on the Verus network: solo staking and pool staking.\n\n**Solo Staking:**\nTo start solo staking, you need to meet the following requirements:\n\n1. Your wallet must be running.\n2. You need a full node, which can be achieved by running Verus Desktop in native mode.\n3. Staking must be enabled.\n4. Your UTXO must be eligible, which happens after 150 blocks.\n5. You need a minimum of 0.00000001 VRSC in your wallet.\n\nIn solo staking, you either win a full block or you win nothing. If you need help with solo staking, you can join the Verus Discord #staking channel, where the community is happy to assist.\n\n**Pool Staking:**\nPool staking offers two options:\n\n1. Non-custodial staking pool: This option allows you to keep control over your funds in combination with VerusID. An example of a non-custodial staking pool is Synergy Pool.\n2. Custodial staking pool: This option involves sending your coins to a pool operator and trusting them with your funds.\n\nIn both cases, pool staking allows you to combine your resources with others to increase your chances of winning blocks and earning rewards.",
    "# Staking\n\nStaking is accessible for everyone. Use Verus holdings to secure the network. It does not matter how much $VRSC you have, there are no minimum requirements to start staking.\n\nOn the Verus blockchain UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) are staking, not balances. A large UTXO has more chances of winning a block than a small UTXO.
