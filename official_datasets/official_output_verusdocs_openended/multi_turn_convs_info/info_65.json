            "What are the features and functionalities of VerusID, specifically regarding revocation, recovery, and the Verus Vault, and how do they enhance security and control over funds?",
            "VerusID offers advanced features to enhance security and control over funds, including revocation, recovery, and the Verus Vault. Let's break down each of these features and how they work:\n\n**Revocation and Recovery:**\nWhen creating a VerusID, users can assign a RevokeID and a RecoveryID to their VerusID. These assigned identities are also VerusIDs and must be purchased. The RevokeID and RecoveryID can be the same identities, different ones, or appointed as \"self\". \n\nWhen a VerusID is revoked, funds cannot be spent anymore. To recover a revoked VerusID, users can recover all assets to a new address, and funds and UTXOs can be spent again. However, it's essential to note that assigning a RecoveryID to \"self\" when the RevokeID is assigned to another identity can lead to a situation where the identity cannot be recovered after revocation.\n\n**Verus Vault:**\nThe Verus Vault is a unique feature that provides an extra layer of security for VerusIDs. It allows users to set locks or timelocks to safeguard funds on a VerusID. Locked identities cannot spend funds, but they can still receive, hold, and stake funds, as well as be used for signing.\n\nThe Verus Vault has three stages:\n\n1. **Locked until x blocks**: Funds cannot be spent until a predetermined number of blocks have passed.\n2. **Locked with delay**: Funds cannot be spent until an unlock has been requested, and a predetermined number of blocks have passed.\n3. **Unlocked**: Funds can be spent.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* Even when a VerusID is locked or timelocked, it can still be revoked and recovered.\n* The Verus Vault does not affect the ability to receive, hold, and stake funds, or use the VerusID for signing.\n\nThe Verus Vault provides an additional layer of security and control over funds, allowing users to set specific conditions for fund accessibility. This feature can be particularly useful in scenarios where users want to ensure that their funds are protected from unauthorized access or unintended spending.",
