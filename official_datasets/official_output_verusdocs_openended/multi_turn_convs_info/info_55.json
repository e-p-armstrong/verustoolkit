            "What are the purposes and effects of the \"preallocations\" and \"prelaunchcarveout\" parameters when defining a currency using Verus, and what are some general guidelines for setting currency supplies?",
            "When defining a currency using Verus, the \"preallocations\" and \"prelaunchcarveout\" parameters serve important purposes.\n\n**Preallocations:**\nThe \"preallocations\" parameter allows you to specify an amount of funds to be directed to a specific VerusID or R-address after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. This can be used with both simple token currencies and basket currencies. When used with basket currencies, the reserve ratio of the currency will be lowered after launch, as new currency is minted and nothing is added to the reserves. For example, in the command `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{ \"name\":\"SocialBrand\", \"options\":33, \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"], \"initialsupply\":500, \"preallocations\":[{\"Max@\":1000}]}', Max@ will receive 1000 SocialBrand after launch, reducing the reserve ratio of the currency.\n\n**Prelaunchcarveout:**\nThe \"prelaunchcarveout\" parameter only works with basket currencies (`options:33`). It allows you to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the rootID after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. This also lowers the reserve ratio, making the currency more volatile.\n\n**Guidelines for Setting Currency Supplies:**\nIt's essential to set currency supplies within a reasonable limit to prevent potential issues. The recommended absolute limit for all currency supplies is 10 billion (minus 1 satoshi) with 8 decimal places (9999999999.99999999). This limit applies to all currency supplies, including those that will be extended over time with conversions and tail emissions for blockchains.",
            "Example currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"SocialBrand\", \n \"options\":33, \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"], \n \"initialsupply\":500, \n \"preallocations\":[{\"Max@\":1000}]\n}'\n```\n\u261d\ufe0f This is a basket currency called SocialBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves and in return they get 500 SocialBrand distributed among them. Immediately after launch Max@ receives 1000 SocialBrand, lowering the reserve ratio of the currency.### **\"preallocations\"**\nUse this parameter to receive a chosen amount of funds after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. Funds can be directed to VerusIDs and R-addresses. Works with simple token currencies and basket currencies.When using this parameter with basket currencies, after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, the reserve ratio is lowered. This is because new currency has been minted after the initial supply (`\"initialsupply\"`) is distributed, and nothing was new added into the reserves.::: danger Limit for all currency supplies (10 billion)\n10 billion (minus 1 satoshi) with 8 decimal places (9999999999.99999999) is now the recommended absolute limit for all currency supplies, including over time with conversions and extended tail emissions for blockchains.\n:::### **\"prelaunchcarveout\"**\nOnly works with basket currencies (`options:33`). Use this to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the rootID.\nAfter the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, a percentage of the reserves is taken and redirected to the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio, making the currency more volatile.",
