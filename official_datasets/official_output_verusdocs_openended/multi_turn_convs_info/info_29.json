            "How do decentralized crowdfund mechanisms work in Verus, and what features are available to customize the launch of a new currency or token?",
            "In Verus, decentralized crowdfund mechanisms allow currencies to be launched through a community-driven process. This process involves setting required minimum levels of worldwide participation in one or more preferred currencies. If the minimum participation levels are not met by the start time of the currency or token, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their preconversions, minus network fees.\n\nThe launch options in Verus provide a range of features to customize the launch of a new currency or token. These features include:\n\n* **Maximum participation**: Setting a maximum limit on participation in one or more currencies to prevent oversubscription.\n* **Pre-launch discounts**: Offering discounts to early participants to incentivize early adoption.\n* **Pre-allocations**: Allocating a portion of the currency or token to select VerusIDs, which can help increase the reserve ratio and issue currencies. These pre-allocations can also include vesting schedules to ensure a gradual release of the allocated funds.\n* **Carve-outs of proceeds**: Setting aside a portion of the launch proceeds for specific purposes, such as funding future development or community initiatives.\n\nThese features provide a high degree of flexibility and customization for currency and token launches on the Verus platform, allowing creators to tailor their launch strategy to their specific needs and goals. By using VerusIDs, launches can also utilize decentralized and transparent mechanisms to ensure a fair and community-driven process.",
            "## Crowdfund mechanisms\nAll currencies can be launched through decentralized crowdfund mechanisms. [Set required minimum levels](/currencies/launch-currency.html#minpreconversion) of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies. If by the start time of your currency or token, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their preconversions, less the network fees.\n\nThe launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral [pre-allocations](launch-currency.html#preallocations) to select VerusIDs that increase the reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral [carve-outs of proceeds](launch-currency.html#prelaunchcarveout), and [pre-launch discounts](launch-currency.html#prelaunchdiscount) for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n\n#",
