            "How does VerusID login work, and what are the steps involved in logging into a website or service using VerusID?",
            "VerusID login is a secure and private way for users to log in to websites and services using their VerusID. Here's how it works:\n\nThe process starts when a user wants to log in to a website or service that supports VerusID login. The user is presented with a QR code, which they scan using their Verus Mobile app. This triggers a verification and data request process, where the app verifies the request from the website and asks the user to reveal some identity data.\n\nThe user can confirm the source of the request and verify the website's identity before trusting it. Once the user trusts the website, the app posts a reply to the website's server in the background, which causes an immediate login and sharing of the requested data privately.\n\nThroughout this process, the user is in control of their personal data and decides how, when, and with whom it is shared. The VerusID login system ensures that users' personal data is protected and respected, and that they have full control over it.\n\nThe key benefits of VerusID login include:\n\n* Private and secure login\n* User control over personal data\n* Private data sharing\n* Trustless verification\n* Immediate login and data sharing\n\nOverall, VerusID login provides a secure, private, and user-controlled way for individuals to log in to websites and services, while maintaining full control over their personal data.",
