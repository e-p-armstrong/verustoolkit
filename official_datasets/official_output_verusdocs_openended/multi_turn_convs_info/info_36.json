            "The VerusPay Invoice specification is a standardized format for creating, managing, and interpreting invoices across the Verus blockchain ecosystem and beyond. It is designed to be universally implementable across various programming languages, focusing on serialization and deserialization processes to ensure interoperability and consistency.\n\nThe VerusPay Invoice construct is the central component of this specification, encapsulating all necessary information for a comprehensive invoice system. The core components of a VerusPay Invoice include:\n\n1. **System ID**: If the invoice is signed by a VerusID, this is the ID system it is signed on.\n2. **Signing ID**: If the invoice is signed by a VerusID, this is the address of the VerusID that signed it.\n3. **Signature**: If the invoice is signed by a VerusID, this is the signature.\n4. **Details**: This component incorporates detailed transaction information through the VerusPay InvoiceDetails sub-component, covering aspects such as:\n\t* Payment amount\n\t* Destination\n\t* Currency\n5. **Version**: This component manages the invoice format version, facilitating future updates and backward compatibility through version flags and checks.\n\nThe VerusPay InvoiceDetails component is embedded within the VerusPay Invoice and provides specific transaction-related data. This specification provides a robust framework for blockchain invoice management, emphasizing interoperability, security, and ease of use. Its design facilitates a seamless payment experience across different blockchain ecosystems, making it a valuable tool for developers, merchants, and users within the Verus network and beyond.",
