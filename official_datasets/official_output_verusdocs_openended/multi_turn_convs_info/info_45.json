            "How does the Verus-Ethereum Bridge ensure secure and decentralized cross-chain communication, and what safeguards are in place to prevent bridge hacks?",
            "The Verus-Ethereum Bridge ensures secure and decentralized cross-chain communication through a process called notarization. Every 10 blocks, block producers create digital receipts, known as notarizations, which contain essential information such as the stateroot, blockheight, blockhash, and gas price for Ethereum. These notarizations are agreed upon by block producers (miners and stakers) and are then mined into the Verus blockchain.\n\nTo prevent bridge hacks, the Verus-Ethereum Bridge has several safeguards in place. Firstly, it would require a majority of colluding, malicious witnesses to successfully mount an attack on the bridge. Additionally, these malicious witnesses would need to have more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain, which is a highly unlikely scenario.\n\nFurthermore, even if such an attack were possible, the bridge provides a way to defend against it. The Verus Protocol's hybrid consensus algorithm, known as Proof of Power (PoP), is designed to be resistant to 51% hash attacks, making it extremely difficult for malicious actors to compromise the bridge.\n\nIn summary, the Verus-Ethereum Bridge's decentralized and provable approach to cross-chain communication, combined with its robust safeguards against bridge hacks, ensures a secure and trustworthy bridge between the Verus and Ethereum blockchains.",
            "Every 10 blocks the block producers create a notarization (when there is traffic over the bridge). They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum. The digital receipts, called \u201cnotarizations\", contain, among other things: the \u201cstateroot\u201d ([Merkle Mountain Range](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp) for Verus, [Merkle Patricia Trie](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/) for Ethereum), the blockheight, blockhash and the gas price for Ethereum.

To successfully mount an attack on the bridge, if a majority of witnesses were colluding or got their private keys stolen the following would need to happen:- Colluding, malicious witnesses.\n- Fake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain. [\ud83d\udc49 Verus Paper: A Provable Hybrid Solution to 51% Hash Attacks](https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf)\n- Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow chain.These requirements are very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain. The bridge even provides a way to defend against such an unlikely scenario.",
