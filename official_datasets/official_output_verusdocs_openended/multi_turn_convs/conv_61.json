    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the different transaction scenarios in Verus, and how they affect the visibility of information. Can you explain the different scenarios, including public-to-public, public-to-private, private-to-public, and private-to-private transactions, and what information is visible or not visible in each scenario?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to break down each transaction scenario in Verus for you.\n\nIn Verus, there are four different transaction scenarios: public-to-public, public-to-private, private-to-public, and private-to-private. Each scenario has its own characteristics in terms of what information is visible or not visible to the public.\n\n**Public-to-Public Transactions:**\nIn a public-to-public transaction, a sender using a `VerusID@`, `R-address`, or `i-address` sends funds to a recipient using a `VerusID@`, `R-address`, or `i-address`. In this scenario, both the sender's address and the amount sent are visible, as well as the recipient's address(es) and received amount(s). So, all information about the transaction is publicly visible.\n\n**Public-to-Private Transactions:**\nIn a public-to-private transaction, a sender using a `VerusID@`, `R-address`, or `i-address` sends funds to a recipient using a `z-address` or `VerusID@:private`. In this scenario, the sender's address and the amount sent are visible, but the recipient's address(es) and received amount(s) are not visible. However, it is still possible to correlate transactions by time and amounts between public and private addresses, potentially linking two public addresses based on transaction patterns. So, while the recipient's information is private, there's still some potential for analysis.\n\n**Private-to-Public Transactions:**\nIn a private-to-public transaction, a sender using a `z-address` sends funds to a recipient using a `VerusID@`, `R-address`, or `i-address`. In this scenario, the sender's address and the amount sent are not visible, but the recipient's address(es) and received amount(s) are visible. Like public-to-private transactions, there remains a possibility of correlating transactions based on timing and value, potentially linking two public addresses. So, in this case, the sender's information is private, but the recipient's is not.\n\n**Private-to-Private Transactions:**\nIn a private-to-private transaction, a sender using a `z-address` sends funds to a recipient using a `z-address` or `VerusID@:private`. In this scenario, both the sender's address and the amount sent are not visible, as well as the recipient's address(es) and received amount(s). This provides the highest level of privacy, as no information about the transaction is visible to the public.\n\nIt's important to note that `z-addresses` can only hold the native blockchain currency and not simple token currencies or basket currencies.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these transaction scenarios or how they impact privacy in Verus?",
