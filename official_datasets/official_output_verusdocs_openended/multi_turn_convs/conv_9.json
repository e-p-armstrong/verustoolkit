    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm creating a new currency on the Verus network and I want to know more about the parameters that can be used to customize the preconversion process. Can you explain what these parameters are and how they affect the preconversion process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen defining a new currency on the Verus network, there are several parameters that can be used to customize the preconversion process. These parameters include \"minpreconversion\", \"maxpreconversion\", and \"initialcontributions\".\n\nLet me break each of these down for you:\n\n**Minpreconversion:**\nThe \"minpreconversion\" parameter is used to set a minimum amount of preconversions required for a currency to launch. If the minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds back. For example, in the case of the CompanyX currency, people need to convert at least 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID during the preconversion time frame in order to receive 250 CompanyX. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch.\n\n**Maxpreconversion:**\nThe \"maxpreconversion\" parameter is used to set a maximum amount of preconversions. During the preconversion time frame, the amount set cannot be exceeded. Everything above this amount will be automatically refunded after the currency is launched. For example, in the case of the CoinCommunity currency, people can convert VRSCTEST into its reserves for 100 CoinCommunity in return, but there cannot be more than 100 VRSCTEST converted into its reserves during the preconversion time frame. Whatever is preconverted more than this amount will be returned.\n\n**Initialcontributions:**\nThe \"initialcontributions\" parameter allows the rootID to contribute some or all of the minimum preconversions directly as part of the currency definition. This can be used to make an initial contribution to either the reserves when it's a basket currency (options:33), or to the rootID when it's a simple token currency (options:32). This parameter provides flexibility in the preconversion process and allows for more control over the initial distribution of the currency.\n\nIt's also important to note that there is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting, which should be taken into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.\n\nI hope that helps! Do you have any more questions about these parameters or the preconversion process in general?",

            "There is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting. Take this into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.Example currency:\n``` json\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"CompanyX\",\n \"options\":32,\n \"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\n \"conversions\":[2],\n \"minpreconversion\":[500]\n}'\n```\n\u261d\ufe0f This simple token currency is called CompanyX. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert at least 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 250 CompanyX, or more when more is converted. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds back.### **\"maxpreconversion\"**\nUse this parameter to set a maximum amount of preconversions.
