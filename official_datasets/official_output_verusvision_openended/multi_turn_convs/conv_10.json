    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in how Verus approaches technology development and its role in the open source community. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus's approach to developing its technology is centered around building a strong foundation of state-of-the-art privacy, security, and interledger transaction capabilities. On top of this foundation, Verus aims to develop advanced features that enhance security, improve decentralization, and prepare for the implementation of autochains and proof of virtue.\n\nTo achieve this, Verus maintains its own open source fork of the Komodo platform, which allows for collaboration with the Komodo team to develop new features and capabilities that can be accessed cross-chain by projects across the Komodo platform and other compatible blockchains. This approach enables Verus to leverage the contributions of others while also contributing back to the broader open source community.\n\nVerus's vision is to create a decentralized and secure ecosystem that can adapt to a changing world. Rather than focusing on specific target dates, Verus prioritizes delivering correct and complete phases, allowing it to be ambitious in its goals while also being flexible and responsive to new developments.\n\nBy taking this approach, Verus aims to achieve its goals of creating a robust and secure blockchain ecosystem that can benefit the entire cryptocurrency community.\n\nDo you have any further questions about Verus's approach to technology development or its role in the open source community?",

Above that, we have already developed advanced features that further enhance\nsecurity, improve decentralization, and prepare for the implementation of autochains and\nproof of virtue.\nWe will maintain our own open source fork of the Komodo platform and collaborate with\nthe Komodo team when possible to develop new features or capabilities that can be accessed\ncross-chain by projects across the Komodo platform and even other blockchains that are\nsimply compatible with Komodo\u2019s Interledger Protocol implementations. We will maintain\nour development as an open source project and contribute back to the broader open source\ncommunity, as we leverage the contributions of others that have made it possible for us to\nbegin realizing our vision as a community.\nAll that said, roadmaps are never perfect. Unless we significantly underpromise and\nprioritize a date so highly that no feature or capability is important in and of itself, targeting\ntimeframes and milestones without specific target dates allows us to be ambitious in our goals\nand adapt to a changing world as we deliver. Even in Phase I, which we have delivered as\nof the writing of this paper, we adjusted our plan, and in an uncharacteristic turn of events,\ndelivered even more than we had originally planned. We do not expect that to always\nbe the case, and we will focus more on correct and complete phases than specific dates\nwhen possible.
