            "Verus respects privacy by leveraging zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge, commonly referred to as zk-SNARKs, which are the most reliable and tested iteration of proven, zero-knowledge privacy technology available today. This technology allows for the creation of decentralized applications that can operate at scale, across any population size, throughout the world, while maintaining the privacy of users.\n\nVerus' goal is to build human organizational tools, including voting and fully self-sovereign identity with a reputation system, that respect privacy. These tools are designed to enable entire human populations to transparently and directly share their knowledge and opinions without the risk of privacy violation, spin, or censorship. Furthermore, Verus plans to leverage human (and eventually non-human) intelligence at scale to solve previously challenging problems in a decentralized manner, financially rewarding those who contribute to their proper function.\n\nTo achieve these goals, Verus introduces autochains, a novel scaling model for blockchain systems. Autochains enable full node miners to provide public blockchain provisioning services, which occur in transient, parallel chains isolated from congestion, disruption, or interference from the main Verus blockchain. This allows for the creation of a decentralized, peer-to-peer system that can serve all people in the world simultaneously, while maintaining the privacy and security of users.",
