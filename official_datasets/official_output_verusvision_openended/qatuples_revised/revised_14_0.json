    "How can Verus improve its resistance to attacks and reduce its power consumption and ecological cost, and what methods can be used to recognize trustworthy participants in the system?",
    "Improving Verus's resistance to attacks and reducing its power consumption and ecological cost can be achieved by recognizing and utilizing trustworthy participants in the system. One way to do this is by using a more accurate statistical function to determine each participant's probability of being either Byzantine or rational. This function can help identify participants who are attempting to strengthen the system and thus can be trusted more than others.\n\nTo recognize trustworthy participants, various methods can be employed. One such method is the Eigentrust reputation management algorithm, which has been proven effective in peer-to-peer networks. This algorithm assigns each participant a public, global trust value based on their history of activity, effectively creating a \"rating\" system for each participant. Participants with lower ratings are considered less trustworthy and are interacted with less by their peers.\n\nThe Eigentrust algorithm assumes that if a participant trusts another participant, they would also trust the participants trusted by that participant. Each participant calculates a local trust value for each other participant they have interacted with, based on their satisfactory or unsatisfactory transactions. When a participant wants to determine if they should trust another participant, they can ask other participants to report on their local trust values and weigh their responses accordingly.\n\nBy using such methods, Verus can improve its resistance to attacks, reduce its power consumption and ecological cost, and create a more secure and trustworthy system for its users.",

This then brings up the\nquestion: \u201cHow do we recognize trustworthy participants?\u201d\nSome methods studied and proven effective are the Eigentrust reputation management\nalgorithm [20], and its improved derivative the Eigentrust++ mechanism implemented in the\nNEM blockchain [22]. Originally designed by Sep Kamvar, Mario Glosser and Hector GarciaMolina in 2003, the Eigentrust algorithm is built to function on peer-to-peer networks. It\naims to isolate byzantine actors in said networks by assigning each peer a public, global trust\nvalue based on their history of activity \u2013 clearly displaying a form of \u201crating\u201d for each peer.\nThose with lower ratings are shown not to be trustworthy, and thus, are interacted with less\nby their peers.\nSimply put, the algorithm assumes that if any given peer a trusts any given peer b,\nthen it would also trust the peers trusted by b. Every peer calculates a local trust value\nfor each other peer it has interacted with, based on the either satisfactory or unsatisfactory\ntransactions it has had with each one. These local trust values are determined by each peer,\nand when peer a wants to know if they should trust peer b, say, before making a transaction,\npeer a would ask all other peers it knows to report on their local trust values of peer b and\nweigh their responses according t",
