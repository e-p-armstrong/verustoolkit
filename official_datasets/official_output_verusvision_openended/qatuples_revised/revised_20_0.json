    "How does Verus plan to create a secure, scalable, and transparent system for running and recording polls, and what are the benefits of this approach?",
    "Verus envisions a system where polls can be run securely, transparently, and with unlimited scalability. To achieve this, Verus will utilize autochains, which are parallel voting chains created dynamically on demand for each poll in its ecosystem. This approach provides improved, isolated security for each poll, allowing for virtually unlimited scaling.\n\nThe Verus wallet, used for voting, will also have the ability to validate blocks through proof-of-stake. This means that voters who participate in validating the election will be able to earn rewards, either in Virtue (when available) or from the outputs of the payment transaction that instantiated the poll.\n\nWhen a poll is complete, the results are posted back to the main Verus chain. The chain used to run the poll can then be archived or deleted, and is typically abandoned. This approach ensures that each poll is run independently, with its own dedicated security and validation, while still maintaining transparency and verifiability.\n\nBy using blockchains as databases for permanent storage, Verus aims to create a system that is truly confidential, verifiable, and transparent. This is crucial for ensuring the integrity of polls and elections, as well as other applications that require secure and transparent data storage and processing.",
