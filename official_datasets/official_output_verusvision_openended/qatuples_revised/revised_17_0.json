    "What types of polls does Verus support, and what features do these polls have?",
    "Verus is designed to support a wide range of poll types, including multiple choice, weighted multiple choice, ranking, and rating polls. These polls can be used for various purposes, such as classifying, selecting, ranking, and rating. Additionally, Verus polls can have various features, including:\n\n* Confidential or public voting\n* Live or delayed poll results\n* Online or offline vote authorization\n* Lottery selected vote authorization\n\nVerus's vision is to provide a comprehensive polling system that can be used for a variety of applications, including political polls, opinion polls, content classification, and ID verification. The system is designed to be flexible and scalable, with the goal of supporting a wide range of poll types and features.\n\nIn terms of the types of polls, Verus supports multiple choice polls, which allow voters to select one or more options from a list of choices. Weighted multiple choice polls allow voters to assign different weights or importance to their choices. Ranking polls allow voters to rank options in order of preference, while rating polls allow voters to assign a rating or score to options.\n\nVerus's poll system is designed to be modular and extensible, with the goal of supporting a wide range of poll types and features. The system is designed to be easy to use and understand, with a simple and intuitive interface for creating and participating in polls.",
    "Verus will support numerous types of polls, those that use weighted or unweighted voting,\nthat seek to expose truth or opinions, and polls that rate and choose collectively. In order to\n13create a sensible taxonomy for polls, one that people will understand, we define the following\ntypes of voting:\n1. Multiple choice\n2. Weighted multiple choice\n3. Ranking\n4. Rating\nWe also define the following types of polls:\n1. Polls to classify\n2. Polls to select\n3. Polls to rank\n4. Polls to rate\nWe do not expect Verus to support all voting and poll types in the early phases. In fact,\nuntil Phase IV, the Verus core team plans to focus on known requirements of multiple choice\nand weighted multiple choice voting. During or after completion of Phase IV, expanding\nsupport for voting and poll types will be higher priority.\nEach type of Verus poll may support confidential or public voting, live or delayed poll\nresults, online or offline vote authorization, and lottery selected vote authorization. We will\nroll out working vote models in phases, as well, initially providing solutions for weighted and\nunweighted selection voting, which fits well for both political and opinion polls as well as\ncontent classification and ID verification.\n3.3.5Intrinsic Polls",
