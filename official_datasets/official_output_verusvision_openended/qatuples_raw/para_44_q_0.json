    "What is the Verus vision, and what are the key features and phases of this vision?",
    "The Verus vision is a long-term mission to advance the Verus project and its contribution to society. At its core, the Verus chain serves as a fungible value chain, with the use of Verus tokens being the central value around which the vision is developed. The vision is divided into four phases, each introducing new capabilities and experiences that provide independent value and further leverage Verus Coin to power operation.\n\n**Phase I - Mainnet:**\nThe first phase of the Verus vision is the mainnet, which features a 50/50 PoW/PoS consensus algorithm, time locks, and a fair launch. The mainnet's emission schedule is designed to slowly increase the block reward over a period of time, reaching its peak and then stabilizing.\n\n**Key Features:**\nThe Verus chain includes several key features, such as zk-SNARKs for privacy, both transparent and private addresses, a brand new CPU-mineable hash algorithm for proof of work, and a unique emission schedule among fair launch cryptocurrency projects.\n\n**Goals and Vision:**\nThe Verus project aims to become a worldwide, inclusive community effort, welcoming and rewarding those who contribute. The vision is to create a foundation upon which to build further phases, ultimately making the world a better place. The project's goal is to advance and contribute to society, with each phase building upon the previous one to achieve this vision.\n\n**Ongoing Mission:**\nThe Verus vision is an ongoing mission, with each phase serving as a stepping stone towards achieving the project's goals. The vision is not limited to the four phases outlined, but rather a continuous effort to advance and improve the Verus project and its contribution to society.",
    "unexpected opportunity or obstacle, take two steps to the right or left, and only then proceed\nforward.\nFor the purpose of this whitepaper, we will discuss four phases of the Verus vision. We do\nnot see these four phases as a completion of the vision as much as four phases of an ongoing\nmission to advance Verus and its contribution to society that we can currently express. From\nits inception and throughout the project, the Verus chain will serve as our fungible value\nchain, and use of Verus tokens on this chain will be the core value around which we continue\nto develop the Verus vision.\nThe first Verus chain, which is already available at the time of this white paper\u2019s release,\nincludes zk-SNARKs for privacy, both transparent and private addresses, a brand new CPUmineable hash algorithm for proof of work, a brand new proof of stake algorithm, and a\nunique emission schedule among fair launch cryptocurrency projects. Each phase of our\nproject\u2019s development will introduce capabilities and experiences that provide independent\nvalue on their own, further leverage Verus Coin to power operation, and create a foundation\nupon which to build the next phase.We intend and hope for the Verus project to become a worldwide, inclusive community\neffort, which welcomes and rewards those who contribute. Although we articulate these first\nfour phases here, we see these phases as just the beginning, and we hope you will join us by\nparticipating in and contributing to the Verus project to make our world a better place.\n204.1Phase I \u2013 Mainnet \u2013 50/50 PoW/PoS \u2013 Time Locks \u2013 Fair\nLaunchIn phase one, the Verus main network began with a slow start and 15 minutes advance notice\nat 7:15am GMT, Monday, May 21st, 2018.\nThe Verus network began emitting first 0 block reward, rising linearly each block over\nthe course of 7 days until block 10080 to its peak of 384 coins per block.
