    "What is the reward schedule for Verus, and how does it incentivize long-term support for the network and project?",
    "The reward schedule for Verus is designed to incentivize long-term support for the network and project. It consists of multiple eras, each with a different block reward structure. In the early stages, the reward curve is accelerated, with a halving every month for the first 5 months. This is intended to encourage early adoption and support.\n\nIn Era 1, the block reward rises linearly from 0 to 384 over the first 10,080 blocks. In Era 2, the reward remains constant at 384 for a period, then halves every 26,199 blocks, eventually reaching 24. In Era 3, the reward continues to halve every 1,051,200 blocks, approximately every 2 years.\n\nTo ensure a smooth release of the Verus currency supply and incentivize long-term support, Verus implements a time-locked coinbase transaction system. During the first two months, when the block rewards are at or above 192 Verus, mined blocks will have time-locked coinbase transactions, preventing spending, staking, or transferring of those coins for a period ranging from approximately 3 months to 2 years and 3 months.\n\nThis design aims to encourage participants to support the long-term success of the Verus network and project, rather than focusing on short-term gains. By providing a stable and predictable reward structure, Verus aims to create a sustainable and equitable environment for all participants.\n\nAdditionally, Verus operates with a dual proof of stake/proof of work mechanism, using the CPU-only VerusHash algorithm, which is designed to be quantum secure and maximize performance on modern CPUs. The algorithm is intended to be fair and accessible, without giving an unfair advantage to any particular group of miners.",
    "chedule is as follows:\nEra 1:\nBlock 0 - 10080 reward: 0 to 384, rising linearly and changing each block\nEra 2:\nBlock 10080 - 53279 reward: 384\nBlock 53280 - 96479 reward: 192\nBlock 96480 - 139679 reward: 96\nBlock 139680 - 182879 reward: 48\nBlock 182880 - 226079 reward: 24\nEra 3:\nBlock 226080 - 1277279 reward: 24\nBlock 1277280 - 2328479 reward: 12\nBlock 2328480 - 3379679 reward: 6\n. . . halving indefinitely every 1051200 blocks (approximately 2 years)\nWe also added another fair twist on the launch that we believe will contribute to a more\nstable value growth in the Verus currency, without any unusual risk of dumping by any single\nparty. During the first 5 months, Verus will have an accelerated reward curve for mining\nand staking, with a halving every month. During the first two months, when the block\nrewards are at or above 192 Verus, mined blocks will have time locked coinbase transactions,\npreventing spending, staking, or transferring of those coins for a period that varies from\napproximately 3 months after the genesis block, based on numbers of blocks, to 2 years and\n3 months. These time locked coins provide a smooth release of the Verus currency supply as\nwell as incentive to all of their owners to support the long term success of the Verus network\nand project.\nFrom the very beginning of its operation, Verus operated with a dual proof of stake /\nproof of work mechanism for all participants. Verus mining with the VerusHash algorithm,\nas of this point, is a CPU-only algorithm, designed with a Haraka512 V2 [30] core to be\nquantum secure and to maximize performance on modern CPUs. While VerusHash was\ndesigned to be CPU-optimized and did not begin life with GPU or ASIC miners capable of\nbeating CPUs in its mining, the Verus developers have no illusions that it is possible someone\nmight develop either a GPU or ASIC-based miner that could be meaningfully superior to\nCPUs.",
