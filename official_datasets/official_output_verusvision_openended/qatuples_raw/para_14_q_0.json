    "What are the three fundamental pillars of the Verus Project, and how do they contribute to the project's vision of a better society?",
    "The Verus Project is built on three fundamental pillars that work together to create a virtuous circle, where each pillar strengthens the others. These pillars are:\n\n1. **Extreme transaction throughput and scalable decentralized applications with autochains**: This pillar enables public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), which allows for the creation of scalable decentralized applications that can process a high volume of transactions. Autochains are a key component of this pillar, as they enable the creation of multiple blockchains that can operate independently and interoperate with each other.\n\n2. **Selectively strong, private identity**: This pillar focuses on providing individuals with a secure and private digital identity that can be used to interact with various blockchain-based applications and services. This identity is selectively strong, meaning that individuals have control over how much information they share and with whom they share it.\n\n3. **Open application support with a foundation of polls, voting, and lottery selection services**: This pillar enables the creation of open applications that can be used to process human knowledge, understanding, and opinion on any content or topic. These applications are built on a foundation of polls, voting, and lottery selection services, which enable secure, transparent, and fair decision-making processes.\n\nTogether, these three pillars contribute to the Verus Project's vision of a better society by enabling the creation of a secure, public platform that respects privacy and can potentially serve as the foundation of a more respectful society. This platform can be used to process human knowledge, understanding, and opinion on any content or topic, and can provide direct querying with confidential and truthful answers across an entire population. The Verus Project's vision is to create a system that promotes transparency, accountability, and fairness, and that can help to build a more respectful and equitable society.",
    "The longer term Verus Project vision of a better society through public blockchain services\nrelies upon three fundamental pillars \u2013where the correct operation of each strengthens the\nothers in the form of a virtuous circle.\nThese pillars are:\n1. Extreme transaction throughput and scalable decentralized applications with autochains,\nwhich provide public blockchains as a service (PBaaS)\n2. Selectively strong, private identity, and\n3. Open application support with a foundation of polls, voting, and lottery selection\nservices.\nEach of these pillars will help us process human knowledge, understanding, and/or opinion on any content or topic. Together, they will enable direct querying \u2013 with confidential\nand truthful \u2013 answers across an entire population. It will create a secure, public platform\nthat respects privacy, and can potentially serve as the foundation of a more respectful society.\nIt is also important to know about the the concept of Verus Virtue when reading further\nin this document. The best way to think about Virtue for the purposes of this document\nis as a separate currency that can be earned, but not purchased or sold, and is part of the\n6evolution of the Verus proof-of-stake algorithm, slated for later phases of the Verus project.\nProof of Virtue is a technology that will be described in much greater detail and implemented\nin later phases of the Verus project.3.1Autochains",
