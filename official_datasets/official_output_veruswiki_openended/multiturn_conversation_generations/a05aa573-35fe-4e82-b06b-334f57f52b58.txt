    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    How do Verus identities work in terms of control, transfer, and management of
    funds and transactions?


    **ANSWER:**

    Verus identities are designed to provide a high level of control and flexibility
    in managing funds and transactions. Here''s how they work:


    **Control and Signatures:** Each identity consists of a set of addresses (one
    or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend
    or sign on behalf of the identity. This ensures that only authorized parties can
    access and manage the funds and transactions associated with the identity.


    **Authority Structure:** Each identity has three types of authorities: Primary,
    Revocation, and Recovery.


    1. **Primary Authority:** This is the self-identity and has the ability to modify
    any part of the identity except its name, parent, and data under the control of
    the other two authorities.

    2. **Revocation Authority:** This identity can revoke the primary identity, which
    will revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control. However, it
    cannot spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.

    3. **Recovery Authority:** This authority can redefine or recover a revoked identity,
    but it cannot change the revocation authority nor modify an unrevoked identity.


    **Transferability:** Identities can be transferred by defining them with primary
    addresses with private keys, which are under another party''s control. When identities
    are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified
    as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.


    **Fund Management:** If an identity is transferred from one party to another,
    all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also
    transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet,
    these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility
    of the balance of an identity using `z_getbalance identity@`.


    **Future-Proofing:** If new address types or signature algorithms are added to
    the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to
    be under the control of the new address type will be compatible with the new technology.
    This ensures that Verus identities are future-proof and can adapt to new developments
    in blockchain technology.'
