    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    What are the steps to define a PBaaS blockchain on the Verus platform, and how
    do you export an ID to a PBaaS chain?


    **ANSWER:**

    Defining a PBaaS blockchain on the Verus platform involves creating a JSON object
    that specifies the properties of the blockchain, including its name, options,
    currencies, conversions, eras, notaries, nodes, and gateway converter details.
    Here''s a breakdown of the components:


    * **Name**: The name of the PBaaS chain, in this case "PBaaSChain".

    * **Options**: An integer value, in this case 264, that specifies the options
    for the chain.

    * **Currencies**: An array of currencies that can be used on the chain, in this
    case only "VRSCTEST".

    * **Conversions**: An array of conversion ratios between the chain''s native currency
    and other currencies, in this case only 1.

    * **Eras**: An array of era definitions, each specifying the reward, decay, halving,
    and end of the era.

    * **Notaries**: An array of VerusIDs that will serve as notaries on the chain.

    * **Minnotariesconfirm**: The minimum number of notaries required to confirm a
    block.

    * **Nodes**: An array of node definitions, each specifying the network address
    and node identity.

    * **Gateway converter**: The name and issuance details of the gateway converter,
    which enables the transfer of funds on and off the chain.


    To define the PBaaS chain, you need to pass two JSON objects to the `definecurrency`
    command: one for the chain definition and one for the bridge definition. The bridge
    definition specifies the currencies supported, initial contributions, and initial
    supply.


    Once the PBaaS chain is defined, you can export an ID to the chain using the `sendcurrency`
    command. This command requires the address of the ID to be exported, the name
    of the PBaaS chain, and the amount of currency to be transferred.


    Here''s an example of the command to export an ID to a PBaaS chain:

    ```

    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]''

    ```

    This command exports the ID "IDNAME@" to the PBaaS chain "PBaaSChainName" with
    an amount of 100 VRSCTEST.'

    **User:**

    I''m trying to get started with creating a PBaaS blockchain on the Verus platform.
    Could you walk me through the steps to define a PBaaS blockchain, and how to export
    an ID to a PBaaS chain?


    **AI Assistant:**

    Defining a PBaaS blockchain on the Verus platform involves creating a JSON object
    that specifies the properties of the blockchain. Let me break it down for you.


    To define a PBaaS blockchain, you''ll need to create a JSON object that includes
    the following components:


    * **Name**: The name of the PBaaS chain.

    * **Options**: An integer value that specifies the options for the chain.

    * **Currencies**: An array of currencies that can be used on the chain.

    * **Conversions**: An array of conversion ratios between the chain''s native currency
    and other currencies.

    * **Eras**: An array of era definitions, each specifying the reward, decay, halving,
    and end of the era.

    * **Notaries**: An array of VerusIDs that will serve as notaries on the chain.

    * **Minnotariesconfirm**: The minimum number of notaries required to confirm a
    block.

    * **Nodes**: An array of node definitions, each specifying the network address
    and node identity.

    * **Gateway converter**: The name and issuance details of the gateway converter,
    which enables the transfer of funds on and off the chain.


    Once you have this JSON object, you''ll need to pass it to the `definecurrency`
    command, along with a second JSON object that specifies the bridge definition.
    The bridge definition includes the currencies supported, initial contributions,
    and initial supply.


    Now, to export an ID to the PBaaS chain, you''ll use the `sendcurrency` command.
    This command requires the address of the ID to be exported, the name of the PBaaS
    chain, and the amount of currency to be transferred.


    Here''s an example of the command to export an ID to a PBaaS chain:

    ```

    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]''

    ```

    This command exports the ID "IDNAME@" to the PBaaS chain "PBaaSChainName" with
    an amount of 100 VRSCTEST.


    Do you have any questions about this process, or would you like more information
    on any of these steps?'
