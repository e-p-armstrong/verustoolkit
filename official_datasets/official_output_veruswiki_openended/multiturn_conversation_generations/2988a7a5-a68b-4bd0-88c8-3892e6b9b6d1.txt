    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    My Verus wallet is stuck on a certain block number and won''t synchronize properly.
    What steps can I take to resolve this issue and get my wallet working again?


    **ANSWER:**

    If your Verus wallet is stuck on a specific block number and won''t synchronize
    with the blockchain, there are several steps you can take to resolve this issue.


    **Step 1: Check your block height**

    First, check your wallet''s block height and compare it to the current block height
    on the Verus blockchain using the explorer link provided. If your wallet''s block
    height is significantly lower (more than 10 blocks behind), then you can proceed
    with the following steps.


    **Step 2: Close your wallet**

    Close your Verus wallet to ensure that it''s not running while you make changes
    to the configuration files.


    **Step 3: Add nodes to your VRSC.conf file**

    Locate the VRSC.conf file in the standard location for your operating system (e.g.,
    `~/.komodo/VRSC` for Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC` for Mac
    OS, or `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\VRSC\` for Windows 10). Add the following lines
    to the bottom of the file, just below `rpcallowip=127.0.0.1`:

    ```

    addnode=157.90.113.198:27485

    addnode=95.217.1.76:27485

    ```

    These lines add new nodes to your wallet''s configuration, which can help it connect
    to the blockchain and synchronize properly.


    **Step 4: Get an up-to-date list of working nodes (optional)**

    If you want to get an up-to-date list of working nodes, you can join the Verus
    Discord channel and message `/peerinfo` in the #tipbot channel. This will give
    you a list of current nodes that you can add to your VRSC.conf file.


    **Step 5: Remove the peers.dat file**

    After adding the new nodes, remove the `peers.dat` file from the VRSC folder.
    Be careful not to remove any other files or folders, as this can cause problems
    with your wallet. You can rename or move the `peers.dat` file to a different location
    if you''re unsure.


    **Step 6: Start your wallet again**

    Finally, start your Verus wallet as you normally would. Your wallet should now
    be able to connect to the blockchain and synchronize properly.


    Remember to be careful when modifying your wallet''s configuration files, and
    make sure you don''t remove any important files or folders. If you''re still having
    trouble with your wallet, you may need to bootstrap it, which is a more involved
    process.'
