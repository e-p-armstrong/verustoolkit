    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    How do you define a new currency on the Verus network, and what does it mean to
    set the proof protocol to PROOF_CHAINID? What are the implications of this setting,
    and how can the controller of the chain ID use it to mint new coins?


    **ANSWER:**

    To define a new currency on the Verus network, you can use the `definecurrency`
    command with the required parameters. For example, to define a new currency called
    "mycoin", you would use the following command:

    ```

    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency ''{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest",
    "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000''

    ```

    In this command, we''re specifying the name of the currency, its options, proof
    protocol, currencies that can be converted to it, minimum pre-conversion amounts,
    and initial supply.


    The `proofprotocol` parameter is set to 2, which corresponds to PROOF_CHAINID.
    This setting means that the controller of the chain ID has the ability to mint
    new coins. This is a powerful feature that allows the controller to create new
    coins and distribute them as needed.


    To mint new coins, the controller of the chain ID can use the `sendcurrency` command
    with the `mintnew` parameter set to 1. For example:

    ```

    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" ''[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]''

    ```

    This command would mint 10,000 new "mycoin" units and send them to the address
    "mike@". The controller of the chain ID can use this feature to manage the supply
    of "mycoin" units and ensure the smooth operation of the currency.


    It''s important to note that the PROOF_CHAINID setting gives the controller of
    the chain ID significant control over the currency, and should be used carefully
    to avoid abuse or mismanagement of the currency.'
  role: user
- content: '## Conversation that answers the provided questions:

    **User:**

    I''m curious about creating a new currency on the Verus network. Can you walk
    me through the process of defining a new currency and explain what it means to
    set the proof protocol to PROOF_CHAINID? What are the implications of this setting,
    and how can the controller of the chain ID use it to mint new coins?


    **AI Assistant:**

    Defining a new currency on the Verus network is a straightforward process. To
    do so, you can use the `definecurrency` command with the required parameters.
    For example, to define a new currency called "mycoin", you would use the following

    ```

    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency ''{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest",

    ```

    In this command, we''re specifying the name of the currency, its options, proof
    protocol, currencies that can be converted to it, minimum pre-conversion amounts,
    and initial supply.


    Now, about the `proofprotocol` parameter. When you set it to 2, which corresponds
    to PROOF_CHAINID, it means that the controller of the chain ID has the ability
    to mint new coins. This is a powerful feature that allows the controller to create
    new coins and distribute them as needed.


    The implications of this setting are significant. With PROOF_CHAINID, the controller
    of the chain ID has full control over the supply of the currency. This means they
    can mint new coins at will, which can be useful for managing the economy of the
    currency or rewarding users for certain activities.


    To mint new coins, the controller of the chain ID can use the `sendcurrency` command
    with the `mintnew` parameter set to 1. For example:

    ```

    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" ''[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]''

    ```

    This command would mint 10,000 new "mycoin" units and send them to the address
    "mike@". The controller of the chain ID can use this feature to manage the supply
    of "mycoin" units and ensure the smooth operation of the currency.


    It''s important to note that the PROOF_CHAINID setting gives the controller of
    the chain ID significant control over the currency, and should be used carefully
    to avoid abuse or mismanagement of the currency.


    Do you have any more questions about defining a new currency on the Verus network
    or using the PROOF_CHAINID setting?'
