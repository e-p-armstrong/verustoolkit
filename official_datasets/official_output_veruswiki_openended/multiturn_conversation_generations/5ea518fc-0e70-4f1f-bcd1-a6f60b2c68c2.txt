    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    What is the `kvupdate` command in Verus, and how can it be used to store a key-value
    pair on an asset chain?


    **ANSWER:**

    The `kvupdate` command in Verus is used to store a key-value pair on an asset
    chain. This feature is only available for asset chains, and it allows users to
    store a key-value pair with an expiration time.


    The `kvupdate` command takes four arguments:


    1. `key`: a string that represents the key.

    2. `value`: a string that represents the value associated with the key.

    3. `days`: a numeric value that specifies the amount of days (or 1440 blocks)
    before the key expires. The minimum expiration time is 1 day.

    4. `passphrase`: an optional string that specifies a passphrase required to update
    the key.


    When the `kvupdate` command is executed, it returns a JSON object with the following
    properties:


    * `coin`: the chain on which the key is stored.

    * `height`: the block height at which the key was stored.

    * `expiration`: the block height at which the key will expire.

    * `flags`: a string that represents the amount of days the key will be stored.

    * `key`: the stored key.

    * `keylen`: the length of the stored key.

    * `value`: the stored value.

    * `valuesize`: the length of the stored value.

    * `fee`: the transaction fee paid to store the key.

    * `txid`: the transaction ID.


    The `kvupdate` command can be executed using the Verus CLI or through a JSON-RPC
    call. For example, to store a key-value pair using the Verus CLI, you can use
    the following command:

    ```bash

    verus kvupdate examplekey "examplevalue" 2 examplepassphrase

    ```

    Alternatively, you can use a JSON-RPC call to execute the `kvupdate` command:

    ```bash

    curl --user myusername --data-binary ''{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method":
    "kvupdate", "params": [examplekey "examplevalue" 2 examplepassphrase] }'' -H ''content-type:
    text/plain;'' http://127.0.0.1:27486/

    ```

    Overall, the `kvupdate` command provides a way to store key-value pairs on an
    asset chain with expiration times, which can be useful for various use cases such
    as storing metadata or configuration data.'

    **User:**

    Hi, I have a question about Verus. What is the `kvupdate` command in Verus, and

    **AI Assistant:**

    The `kvupdate` command in Verus is a powerful tool that allows users to store
    a key-value pair on an asset chain. This feature is only available for asset chains,

    the key and value you want to store, respectively. The `days` argument specifies
    the amount of days (or 1440 blocks) before the key expires, with a minimum expiration
    time of 1 day. The `passphrase` argument is an optional string that specifies
    a passphrase required to update the key.


    When you execute the `kvupdate` command, it returns a JSON object with information
    about the stored key-value pair, including the chain, block height, expiration
    time, flags, key, key length, value, value length, transaction fee, and transaction
    ID.


    You can execute the `kvupdate` command using the Verus CLI or through a JSON-RPC
    call. For example, to store a key-value pair using the Verus CLI, you can use
    the following command:
