    "What are the Verus commands to list shielded addresses, operation IDs, and received amounts by a specific address, and how do I use them?",
    "The Verus commands to list shielded addresses, operation IDs, and received amounts by a specific address are `z_listaddresses`, `z_listoperationids`, and `z_listreceivedbyaddress`, respectively.\n\n**`z_listaddresses`**:\nThis command returns a list of Sprout and Sapling shielded addresses belonging to the wallet. It takes an optional argument `includeWatchonly` which is a boolean value that defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, it will also include watch-only addresses. The result is a JSON array of strings, where each string is a shielded address.\n\nExample usage:\n```bash\n> verus z_listaddresses\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_listaddresses\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\n**`z_listoperationids`**:\nThis command returns a list of operation IDs currently known to the wallet. It takes an optional argument `status` which is a string that filters the result by the operation's state (e.g., \"success\"). The result is a JSON array of strings, where each string is an operation ID.\n\nExample usage:\n```bash\n> verus z_listoperationids\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_listoperationids\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\n**`z_listreceivedbyaddress`**:\nThis command returns a list of amounts received by a specific shielded address belonging to the node's wallet. It takes two arguments: `address` which is the private address, and `minconf` which is a numeric value that defaults to `1`. `minconf` specifies the minimum number of confirmations required for a transaction to be included in the result.\n\nExample usage:\n```bash\n> verus z_listreceivedbyaddress \"address\" 1\n```\n\nThese commands can be used to manage and query the shielded addresses and transactions associated with a Verus wallet.",
