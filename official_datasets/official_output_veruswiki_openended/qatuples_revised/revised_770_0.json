    "What are some limitations and considerations to be aware of when working with multi-currency on the Verus platform, and what steps should be taken when updating to a new version of Verus?",
    "When working with multi-currency on the Verus platform, there are a few limitations and considerations to be aware of.\n\n**Limitations in Multi-Currency:**\n\n1. **ID Names and i-Addresses:** Be careful when creating IDs with names that are identical to i-addresses. This can cause problems and confusion when referring to currencies or IDs, as the protocol will interpret the i-address as a calculated ID based on the name registration, rather than the actual ID name. It's advised to avoid creating IDs with i-addresses as names.\n2. **Currency Name Conflicts (GUI Only):** In the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same names as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is temporary and will be resolved in future releases.\n\n**Updating to a New Version of Verus:**\n\nWhen updating to a new version of Verus, it's essential to delete the old testnet directories to ensure a smooth transition. The directories to delete vary depending on your operating system:\n\n* **Linux:** `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* **MacOS:** `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* **Windows:** `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nBy taking these precautions, you can avoid potential issues and ensure a successful update to the new version of Verus.",
    "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/vrsctest\n```**MacOS**\n```\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest\n```**Windows**\n```\n\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST\n```# Disclaimer",
