    "How does Verus enable the launch of new currencies, and what features does it offer to make this process easy and flexible?",
    "Verus provides a robust platform for launching new currencies with a range of features that make the process easy, flexible, and secure. These features include:\n\n**Kickstarter-like Minimums:** Verus allows currency creators to set minimum participation requirements for their currency launch. If these requirements are not met, the funds are automatically refunded to participants.\n\n**Dynamic Currency Launch Pricing:** The pricing for the currency launch is dynamic and based on participation. This means that the price of the currency adjusts according to the level of interest and participation in the launch.\n\n**Pre-launch Participation Price Discounts:** Verus offers price discounts for early participants in the currency launch, encouraging people to get involved early on.\n\n**Pre-conversion Reserve Currency Carveouts:** Currency creators can set aside a portion of the total currency supply for pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, allowing for more flexibility in the launch process.\n\n**Price-Neutral Launch Pre-allocations:** Verus enables price-neutral launch pre-allocations, ensuring that the launch process is fair and transparent.\n\n**Easy-to-Use Commands and Parameters:** All of these features can be accessed and configured using easy-to-understand commands and parameters, with no programming necessary.\n\n**Fractional Reserve Capabilities:** Currencies launched on Verus can be configured to accept a range of other currencies and can be launched with or without fractional reserve capabilities.\n\n**Integration with Other Blockchains:** Verus' import/export protocol is designed to make integration with other blockchains provable and easy. This enables seamless interaction between Verus and other blockchain networks, such as Ethereum and ERC20 tokens.\n\n**Multi-chain and Dynamic Merge Mining:** Verus is also preparing to enable multi-chain and dynamic merge mining capabilities, which will allow Verus network chains to operate independently while still being merge mineable with up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash. This will enable all network blockchains to provide fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens and native zk-SNARK supporting currencies.",
    "# The Best Way to Launch a Currency\nCurrency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!Currencies can be launched to accept a range of other currencies and with or without fractional reserve capabilities. Verus import/export protocol was designed to make integration with other block chains provable and easy, and there are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, where currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network, and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.# Preparing for Multi-chain, Dynamic Merge Mining\nWhile this 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology which was running on testnet last year. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies as well.## Sending and Converting Currency\n**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**",
