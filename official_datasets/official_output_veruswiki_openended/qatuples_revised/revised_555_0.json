    "What are the necessary steps to take when updating Verus to a new version, specifically when transitioning from an older version to a new one that includes a testnet reset?",
    "When updating Verus to a new version, especially when transitioning from an older version to a new one that includes a testnet reset, it's crucial to take certain steps to ensure a smooth transition. \n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that the testnet was deleted and relaunched in this new version. This means that any previous testnet data or configuration will be lost, and the testnet will start from scratch. \n\nTo avoid any conflicts or issues, **it's highly recommended to delete specific directories** before running the new update. These directories contain the old testnet data and configuration, which will be incompatible with the new version. \n\nThe directories to be deleted vary depending on your operating system:\n- On Linux, delete `~/.komodo/vrsctest`.\n- On MacOS, delete `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`.\n- On Windows, delete `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`.\n\nBy deleting these directories, you'll ensure a clean start with the new testnet and avoid any potential issues arising from incompatible data or configurations.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that Verus is experimental and unfinished software, and its use comes with no warranty or guarantee. Users are advised to use it at their own risk and should be aware of the potential risks and limitations associated with the software.\n\nThe software is provided under an open-source license, which allows users to modify, distribute, and use the software freely, but also stipulates that the authors and copyright holders are not liable for any damages or claims arising from the use of the software.",
