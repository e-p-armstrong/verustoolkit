    "How do I create a new currency on the Verus network, and what are the steps involved in launching and converting to the new currency?",
    "To create a new currency on the Verus network, you can use the `definecurrency` command. For example, let's say you want to create a currency called \"gold\". You would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines the properties of the new currency, including its name, options, convertible currencies, conversion rates, and minimum preconversion amounts.\n\nBefore the currency can be launched, it must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST, and 1000 VRSCTEST must be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD. Once these conditions are met, the currency will launch automatically as part of the mining process.\n\nAfter the currency has launched, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will \"park\" your conversion until the token launches, at which point you will either receive the converted amount of GOLD or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\nOnce the new currency has launched, you can create additional currencies that can be converted to and from the new currency. For example, you could create a currency called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to and from GOLD or VRSCTEST. To do this, you would use the `definecurrency` command again, specifying the properties of the new currency and its conversion rates with the existing currencies.\n\nIt's worth noting that, at present, the only way to create new tokens is through a centralized issuance option. However, Verus is a decentralized platform, and the mining process is what enables the launch of new currencies and the conversion of existing currencies to new ones.",
    "my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
