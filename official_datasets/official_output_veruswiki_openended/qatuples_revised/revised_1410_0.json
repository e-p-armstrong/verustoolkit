    "How can I create and launch a trusted currency like \"gold@\" that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold, and a token like \"mycoin@\" that offers utility or product value, using Verus?",
    "To create and launch a trusted currency like \"gold@\" and a token like \"mycoin@\", you can use the Verus command line interface. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n**Defining the Currency \"gold@\"**\nFirst, you need to define the currency \"gold@\" using the `definecurrency` command. This command sets the properties of the currency, such as its name, options, and conversion rates. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a currency called \"gold\" with specific options and conversion rates. The `preallocations` property allocates a certain amount of gold to the identity \"mike@\".\n\n**Launching the Currency \"gold@\"**\nAfter defining the currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command to initiate a currency launch. The launch will start 50 blocks from when it was made, and it requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to GOLD**\nOnce the currency is launched, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command converts 100 VRSCTEST to GOLD at a rate of 1:0.975.\n\n**Creating the Token \"mycoin@\"**\nTo create a token like \"mycoin@\", you can use a similar process to define the token and set its properties. For example, you can define the token \"mycoin@\" as a Kickstarter-like token that offers utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\n\nIn summary, creating and launching a trusted currency like \"gold@\" and a token like \"mycoin@\" requires defining the currency and token properties, funding the identity of the currency, initiating the launch, and converting VRSCTEST to the new currency or token using the Verus command line interface.",
    " hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted t",
