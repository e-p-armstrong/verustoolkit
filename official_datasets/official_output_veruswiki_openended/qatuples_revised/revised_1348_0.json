    "How do you sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, create a tokenized ID control, and create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent in Verus?",
    "In Verus, there are several operations that can be performed to manage transactions, tokenized IDs, and identities. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform these operations:\n\n**Signing Transactions from Multi-Signature IDs:**\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a transaction**: Use the `sendcurrency` command to create a transaction from a multi-signature ID. The format is `verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'`.\n2. **Get the raw transaction data**: Use the `z_getoperationstatus` command to get the raw transaction data. The format is `verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>`.\n3. **Sign the transaction**: Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs. Use the `signrawtransaction` command to sign the transaction. The format is `verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>`.\n4. **Broadcast the transaction**: After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command. The format is `verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>`.\n\n**Tokenizing ID Control (Next Generation NFT):**\nTo create a tokenized ID control, also known as a next-generation NFT, you need to define a currency with specific options and properties. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n1. **Define the currency**: Use the `definecurrency` command to define a currency with the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN` flags, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre-allocated or pre-converted to. The format is `verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'`.\n\n**Creating an Identity with a Fractional Currency as its Parent:**\nTo create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent, you need to use the `registernamecommitment` command with additional arguments. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n1. **Register a name commitment**: Use the `registernamecommitment` command with two additional positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. The format is `registernamecommitment <name> <currency_parent> <funding_address>`. You can use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank.\n\nThese operations allow you to manage transactions, tokenized IDs, and identities in Verus. By following these steps, you can create and manage complex transactions and identities in the Verus ecosystem.",
    "### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)\nCreate transaction, get raw transaction data:\n ```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\nTake the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:\n ```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:\n ```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):\nThe currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```### Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent\n`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration",
