    "What is Verus Vault, and how does it protect funds on a VerusID?",
    "Verus Vault is a feature of the Verus ecosystem that provides an additional layer of security to protect funds on a VerusID. With Verus Vault, you can lock your VerusID, which prevents anyone, including the owner of the private key, from spending funds associated with that identity until it is unlocked. This means that even if your private key is stolen, the thief will not be able to access your funds.\n\nWhile the VerusID is locked, you can still stake your funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. You can also continue to receive funds on that identity. However, to spend or access the funds, you will need to unlock the VerusID, which will trigger a waiting period before the funds can be accessed.\n\nTo enable Verus Vault, you need to have at least one primary identity and one revocation/recovery ID configured. The revocation and recovery authority identities can still revoke and recover the locked VerusID, which provides an additional layer of security.\n\nVerus Vault is particularly useful in preventing the \"5 dollar wrench attack,\" where an attacker steals your private key by physical means. With Verus Vault, you can set a delay time, such as 24 hours, before the funds can be accessed after unlocking. This allows you or a third-party service to detect and respond to unauthorized unlock attempts.\n\nIn addition to protecting funds, Verus Vault also provides security for IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. Overall, Verus Vault provides a decentralized solution for protecting and recovering funds, preserving your assets and generational blockchain wealth without the need for a traditional bank.",
    "#### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",
