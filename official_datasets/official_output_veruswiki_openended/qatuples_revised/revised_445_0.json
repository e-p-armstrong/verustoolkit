    "What are some limitations to be aware of when creating and using multi-currencies in Verus, and what are the implications of these limitations?",
    "There are two important limitations to be aware of when creating and using multi-currencies in Verus. \n\n**Limitation 1: IDs with i-addresses as names**\nIn Verus, it is possible to create an ID with an i-address as its actual name, but this is not recommended. Using an i-address as an ID name can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used, and it is not supported for creating currencies. This is because an i-address is calculated based on a name registration, and using it as an ID name can lead to confusion. To prevent user confusion, the set of characters that are not allowed for currency registrations will be expanded.\n\n**Limitation 2: Currency naming conflicts in the GUI**\nIn the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same names for a PBaaS chain. This limitation is specific to the GUI and will be addressed before mainnet availability.\n\n**Importance of understanding these limitations**\nIt is essential to understand these limitations to avoid potential issues when creating and using multi-currencies in Verus. By being aware of these limitations, you can ensure a smoother experience and avoid problems that may arise from using i-addresses as ID names or conflicting currency names.\n\n**Disclaimer and permission notice**\nIt is also important to note that Verus is experimental and unfinished software, and users should be aware of the risks involved. The software is provided without warranty, and users are granted permission to use, modify, and distribute the software under certain conditions, including the inclusion of the copyright notice and permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the software.",
    "#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.### DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
