    "What are the steps to launch a new token, such as GOLD, on the Verus network, and how can I convert VRSCTEST to this new token? Additionally, how can I create a new token, mycoin, that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?",
    "Launching a new token, such as GOLD, on the Verus network requires a few steps. First, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate the currency launch. This launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction was made, and it must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. This process is part of the mining process, and miners who mine the blocks that launch the currency will earn a 0.025% conversion fee.\n\nOnce the token is launched, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the `sendcurrency` command. For example, you can issue the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, and you will either receive 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\nIf you want to create a new token, mycoin, that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can use the `definecurrency` command. This command allows you to define the properties of the new token, such as its name, options, currencies, and initial supply. For example, you can create mycoin with the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\" with the specified properties. Note that the `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. The `currencies` property lists the currencies that can be converted to mycoin, and the `minpreconversion` property defines the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin.",
    "ncy must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
