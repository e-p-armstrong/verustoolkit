    "What is a sample chain definition in Verus, and what are the key properties that can be configured when defining a chain?",
    "A sample chain definition in Verus is a command that defines the properties of a new chain. The command uses the `definechain` option with `verusd` and includes a JSON object that specifies the chain's configuration.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key properties that can be configured when defining a chain:\n\n**Name:** The name of the chain, in this case, \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\".\n\n**Payment Address:** The address that will receive the premine, in this case, \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\".\n\n**Premine:** The amount of the premine, in this case, 50,000,000,000,000.\n\n**Initial Contribution:** The initial contribution amount, in this case, 5,000,000,000,000.\n\n**Conversion:** The conversion rate, in this case, 100,000,000.\n\n**Minimum Preconvert:** The minimum amount required for preconversion, in this case, 45,000,000,000,000.\n\n**Maximum Preconvert:** The maximum amount allowed for preconversion, in this case, 100,000,000,000,000.\n\n**Launch Fee:** The fee for launching the chain, in this case, 0.\n\n**Billing Period:** The billing period, in this case, 14,400 seconds.\n\n**Notarization Reward:** The reward for notarization, in this case, 100,000,000,000.\n\n**Eras:** An array of era configurations, each specifying the reward, decay, halving, and era end for that era. In this case, there is only one era with a reward of 5,000,000,000 and no decay or halving.\n\n**Nodes:** An array of node configurations, each specifying the network address and payment address for that node. In this case, there are two nodes with different network addresses but the same payment address.\n\nOverall, this chain definition specifies a chain that emits a premine to the specified address and converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. The chain's reserve deposits are funded by contributions, and the more contributions, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start, and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.",
    "**Sample chain definition:**\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{\"name\":\"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\",\"premine\":50000000000000,\"initialcontribution\":5000000000000,\"conversion\":100000000,\"minpreconvert\":45000000000000,\"maxpreconvert\":100000000000000,\"launchfee\":0,\"billingperiod\":14400,\"notarizationreward\":100000000000,\"eras\":[{\"reward\":5000000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0,\"eraoptions\":1}],\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"ipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"},\n{\"networkaddress\":\"2ndipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"}]}'\n```The example above defines a chain that emits a premine to the indicated address and also converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.",
