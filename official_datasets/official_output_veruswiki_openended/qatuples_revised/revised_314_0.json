    "How can I park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, and later create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST?",
    "In the Verus ecosystem, you can park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches using the `sendcurrency` command. This command allows you to specify the conversion details, including the address to receive the converted tokens, the token to convert to, whether to perform a pre-conversion, and the amount to convert.\n\nHere's an example of how to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token called `gold`:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will effectively park your conversion until the `gold` token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount of `gold` in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nLater, if you want to create a new token called `mycoin` that can be converted to with either `gold` or VRSCTEST, you can use the `definecurrency` command. This command allows you to specify the properties of the new token, including its name, options, proof protocol, currencies it can be converted to, and initial supply.\n\nHere's an example of how to create `mycoin`:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines a new token named `mycoin` that can be converted to with either `vrsctest` or `gold`. The `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. The `options` and `minpreconversion` properties are also specified, and the initial supply of `mycoin` is set to 20,000 units.",
    "ST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
