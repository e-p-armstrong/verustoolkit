    "How does the Verus DeFi protocol ensure that all currency conversions are solved and priced simultaneously, and what are the benefits of launching a new blockchain with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool?",
    "The Verus DeFi protocol addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This is achieved by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n\nIn addition, the Verus DeFi protocol provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities. This means that miners and stakers are incentivized to participate in the consensus process, which helps to maintain the integrity and security of the blockchain.\n\nOne of the key benefits of the Verus DeFi protocol is that it allows for the simultaneous launch of a new blockchain and a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This bridge converter liquidity pool is bound to the launch of the new blockchain and runs on the new blockchain, ensuring that all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain.\n\nThe Verus DeFi protocol also provides a unique crowdfunding model for launching new currencies, which allows for minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge). This model ensures that participants are protected in case the minimum participation levels are not met, and also provides for pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations, and carve-outs.\n\nOverall, the Verus DeFi protocol provides a robust and secure framework for launching new blockchains and currencies, while ensuring that all participants are fairly incentivized and protected.",
    "ncies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-out",
