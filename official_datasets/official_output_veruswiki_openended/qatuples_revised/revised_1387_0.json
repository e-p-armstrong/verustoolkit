    "How can I set up pool-mining on a Mac with low priority, so it doesn't interfere with other processes running on my computer, and what are the necessary steps to configure the miner and batchfile?",
    "To set up pool-mining on a Mac with low priority, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Download and configure the pool-mining software**\nFirst, download your preferred miner from the Verus website. Extract the miner to your preferred location and configure the batchfile with the pool of your choice and your own mining address. You can refer to the Verus documentation for more information on configuring the miner.\n\n**Step 2: Adjust the batchfile to run on low priority**\nTo run the miner on low priority, you'll need to add the `nice -n 19` command to the batchfile. This will deprioritize the mining process, allowing your computer to throttle down the miner whenever it needs processing power for other tasks.\n\nFor example, if you're using NHEQMINER, you can run the following command:\n```\nnice -n 19./nheqminer -v -l pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -p x -t 6\n```\nMake sure to replace the pool (`pool.verus.io:9999`) with your preferred pool and the address (`RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ`) with your own mining address. The address shown in this example is the Veruscoin foundation donation address.\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up pool-mining on your Mac with low priority, allowing you to use CPU-heavy applications like games without interference from the miner.",
    "# MacOS pool-mining on low priority.\n\nAttention: Read it completely before use.\n\n### Useful links for VRSC mining:\n\n[Miners download page](https://verus.io/get-vrsc)\n[Miner configuration guide](#!faq-macos\\mac-faq03-mining_guide.md)\n\n## Procedure:\n\nIn order to let your mining not interfere with other processes running on your PC, we'll need to deprioritize the mining process. This will result in your miner throttling down whenever your PC needs processing power.\nPeople have reported to be able to use CPU-heavy applications, like games, without the miner interfering, with this method.\n\nBecause the Verus wallet (GUI and CLI) does a lot more than mining, it is not recommended to use this for a solo-mining setup.\n\nFirst thing you will need is pool-mining software. The link is supplied above this procedure. Download your preferred miner, extract it to your prefered location and configure the batchfile with the pool of your choice and your own mining address.\n\nNow we'll need to adjust the batchfile to run on low priority:\n\n#### NHEQMINER:\n\n- Run your miner as you normally would, with `nice -n 19 ` placed in front of the command you normally use,\n  for example:\n   `nice -n 19 ./nheqminer -v -l pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -p x -t 6`\n - make sure you replace the pool (`pool.verus.io:9999`) with your prefered pool and the address\n  (`RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ`) with your own address. The address shown in this line is the veruscoin\n  foundation donation address. If desired change the identifier (`Donator`) to a name that easily identifies the\n  miner to you.\n\nCreated by Oink.vrsc@.\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-11-11.",
