    "What are some limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus, and what are the implications of these limitations?",
    "When working with multi-currency in Verus, there are two main limitations to be aware of:\n\n**Limitation 1: Using I-Addresses as Currency Names**\nOne limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This means that if an ID has an i-address as its name, it will cause problems when trying to use that i-address or name in various cases. This is because the naming system will interpret an i-address as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. While it is not prevented by the protocol, using an i-address as a currency name is not supported and will lead to issues. To avoid confusion, the naming system will also be expanding the set of characters that are not allowed for currency registrations.\n\n**Limitation 2: Conflicting Currency Names in GUI**\nAnother limitation, specific to the GUI, is that if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This means that you cannot create a PBaaS chain with the same name as an existing supported currency. This limitation is considered errata and will be addressed before mainnet availability.\n\n**Disclaimer and Licensing**\nIt is essential to note that the software is experimental and unfinished, and users are advised to use it at their own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage. The software is licensed under an open-source license, which allows users to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, subject to certain conditions, including the inclusion of the copyright notice and permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.",
    "#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.### DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
