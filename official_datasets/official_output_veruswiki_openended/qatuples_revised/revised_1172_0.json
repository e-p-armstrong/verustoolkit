    "Verifying the authenticity and integrity of Verus software downloads is crucial to ensure that you are installing legitimate and safe software. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n**Understanding False Positives:**\nAntivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky may flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because Verus is a cryptocurrency mining software, and these warnings are intended to alert you that you are installing mining software that could potentially be used to exploit your PC.\n\n**Verifying Downloads:**\nTo verify the authenticity and integrity of Verus software downloads, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Extract the downloaded archive:** First, extract the downloaded archive file to a directory of your choice.\n2. **Verify the signature:** Next, verify the signature of the extracted archive using the extracted text file. This text file contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature.\n3. **Verify the file or checksum:** You can verify the file directly using the `verifyfile` command or verify the checksum using the `verifyhash` command. Both commands use the signer's identity, which is \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\".\n\n**CLI Examples:**\nHere are some examples of how to use the `verifyfile` and `verifyhash` commands:\n\n**Verifying a file directly:**\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AeLPFAABQR+s98mnsOWxeaCcqPQ/Fc8d5cZh8QJtbz/ZGXqAtlKtyx1fV2HX2wO755f3O6qeT+Oyvk8SAK2bTA+rFOVsUQAk /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.2-7-amd64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.2-7-x86_64.tar.gz\n```\n**Verifying using a checksum:**\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AeLPFAABQR+s98mnsOWxeaCcqPQ/Fc8d5cZh8QJtbz/ZGXqAtlKtyx1fV2HX2wO755f3O6qeT+Oyvk8SAK2bTA+rFOVsUQAk d24732b7d81eabdb15ea8bb775c6d833117f934694628a2e8c3c09fb7d8fa601\n```\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that you are installing legitimate and safe Verus software.",
