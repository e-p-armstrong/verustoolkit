    "What features and enhancements are available in the Verus daemon version v0.7.1-4, specifically with regards to multi-currency technology, currency conversion, and currency management?",
    "The Verus daemon version v0.7.1-4 offers several new features and enhancements, particularly in the context of multi-currency technology, currency conversion, and currency management. While this version is not yet considered hardened for mainnet, it provides a technology preview on the Verus Testnet.\n\nOne of the key enhancements is the \"sendcurrency\" API, which is already available on Verus mainnet in its simplified form. On the Testnet, this API is enhanced with new multi-currency parameters. The first parameter, \"currency\":\"currencyname\", specifies the source currency of the send. The default currency name on Testnet is \"vrsctest\". The next parameter, \"convertto\":\"currencyname\", allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source.\n\nAdditionally, version v0.7.1-4 enables increased scale over previous versions, allowing for the application of both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency. This feature enables price-neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies.\n\nAnother important feature introduced in this version is the \"burn\" parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API. If \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent, which must be a token or fractional currency, is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.\n\nOverall, the Verus daemon version v0.7.1-4 provides a range of enhancements and features that improve the functionality and flexibility of multi-currency management and conversion on the Verus platform.",
    "While Verus daemon v0.7.1-4 has no improvements for mainnet operation, it offers full support for the new Verus Testnet multi-currency technology preview. On testnet, the new \"sendcurrency\" API, which is already available on Verus mainnet in its simplified form, is enhanced with new multi-currency parameters. The first parameter, \"currency\":\"currencyname\" - where the default on testnet for currency name is \"vrsctest\", specifies the source currency of the send. The next, \"convertto\":\"currencyname\", allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source.# Enhancements to TestNet Protocols for Increased Scale, Currency Burn Functions, and Centralized Fractional Currencies\nVersion v0.7.1-4 is not yet considered hardened for mainnet, but has increased scale over previous versions in addition to the ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency. This allows price neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. This version also enables a new parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API called \"burn\". If \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent, which must be a token or fractional currency is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.",
