    "Where are the standard file locations for Verus Desktop, including the installation folder, daemon locations, program settings, and standard chain data and wallet locations?",
    "When installing Verus Desktop, the installer suggests two standard locations depending on whether you want to install it for all users or just yourself.\n\n**For All Users:**\nThe standard installation location for all users is `%ProgramFiles%\\Verus-Desktop`.\n\n**For Current User Only:**\nThe standard installation location for the current user only is `%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Verus-Desktop`.\n\nIt's essential to note that changing files in these folders or subfolders may result in a corrupt installation, so only do so when instructed by the Verus support community.\n\n**Daemon Locations:**\nThe daemons are located in the `komodod`, `verusd`, and `zcashd` folders, which can be found in the `resources\\app\\assets\\bin\\win64\\` subfolder of the installation folder.\n\n**Program Settings:**\nVerus Desktop saves its program settings in a different folder: `%AppData%\\Verus-Desktop`. The user's settings are stored in `appdata\\config.json` within the program settings folder.\n\n**Standard Chain Data and Wallet Locations:**\nThe standard locations for chain data and wallet folders are as follows:\n\n* **KMD (Komodo):** `%AppData%\\Komodo`\n* **Verus (VRSC):** `%AppData%\\Komodo\\VRSC`\n* **Komodo Asset Chains:** Any Komodo asset chain will create a subfolder in the KMD chain data and wallet folder, with a standard name in capitals, identical to the official asset-chain name. For example:\n\t+ Pirate: `%AppData%\\Komodo\\PIRATE`\n\t+ Utrum: `%AppData%\\Komodo\\OOT`\n\t+ Zexo: `%AppData%\\Komodo\\ZEXO`\n\nYou can access these folders easily using the debug menu in Verus-Desktop.",
