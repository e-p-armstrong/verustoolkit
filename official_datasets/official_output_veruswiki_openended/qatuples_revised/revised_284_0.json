    "How do I create a new identity using the Verus command-line interface, and what are the benefits of having an identity?",
    "Creating a new identity using the Verus command-line interface involves a two-step process designed to prevent \"name front running\" by selfish miners. Here's how to create a new identity and the benefits of having one:\n\n**Step 1: Commit to a Friendly Name**\nFirst, you need to commit to a friendly name that you wish to have in your identity. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has the name you want, you'll need to either be the first to purchase it or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.\n\n**Step 2: Register the Identity**\nOnce you've committed to a name, you need to register it and reveal your commitment. To register an identity, you'll need to pay a fee of 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the fee is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity using the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money is automatically spent along with your registration.\n\n**Benefits of Having an Identity**\nHaving a Verus identity provides several benefits, including:\n\n* The ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash, making transactions more user-friendly.\n* Easy use of CLI commands, such as `z_sendmany` and `sendtoaddress`, which can be used to send funds to other identities.\n* Unique and memorable names for identities, making it easier to identify and interact with other users on the blockchain.\n\nIn summary, creating a new identity using the Verus command-line interface involves committing to a friendly name and registering it with a fee. Having an identity provides a more user-friendly experience and enables easier transactions with other users on the blockchain.",
    "## Making a new identity\nArguably, the hardest part of the new Verus identity technology is just making your first identity, especially without a GUI. Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ \u2018[{\u201caddress\u201d:\u201dalice@\u201d, \u201camount\u201d:100}]\u2019\n```\nor\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100\n```\nMaking a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. To prevent this name \u201cfront running\u201d, you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows:",
