    "How does staking work in Verus, and what are the requirements for staking?",
    "Staking in Verus allows users to participate in the validation process and earn rewards. To start staking, you need to have VRSCs that are not time-locked, stored in a public and transparent wallet, and are at least 150 blocks old (approximately 2.5 hours).\n\nThe chance of winning a block reward through staking is determined by the proportion of your coins in your public and transparent wallet to the total staking supply in public and transparent wallets. The maximum total staking supply is around 485,000 VRSC, which is the amount available from the first week of Verus.\n\nIt's important to note that there is only one reward every minute, which can be either mining or staking. On average, this means 720 mining and 720 staking rewards per day.\n\nAs an example, if you have 300 coins in a public and transparent address, and there are 300,000 coins in public wallets, your chance of winning a staking block reward would be around 1/1000 x 720, or an average of 1.4 days.\n\nHash power does not influence staking rewards, so anyone can participate in staking regardless of their computing power.\n\nRegarding time-locked coins, these are coins that are received through mining or staking rewards and are initially locked. To use these coins for staking or transactions, you need to send them to a private address and then to a public and transparent address. Once the time lock is removed, you can transfer the coins back to your public and transparent address, and they will automatically start staking.\n\nIn your Verus debug.log, you may see the message \"No eligible staking transaction found.\" This message simply means that you are staking but have not received a reward yet.",
    "# Question: How does staking work?\n\nYou'll start staking with the first VRSCs that are not time locked + in your public / transparent wallet + 150 blocks old (or about 2.5 hours).\n\nYour chances to win a block: Your coins in your public/transparent wallet / Total staking supply in public/transparent wallets (which is max. about 485.000 VRSC from the first (sunrise) week as long as the rewards were below 192)\n\nRemember: There will be only one reward every minute. It\u2019s going to be either mining or staking, so on average 720 mining and 720 staking rewards every day.\n\nExample: I have 300 coins in a public/transparent address / 300.000 in public wallets (let's assume some part is lost/not staking or in private wallets), so that would be 1/1000 x 720 of a chance or around average 1,4 days for a staking block rewards. Hash power does not influence staking reward.\n\nRegarding the Verus debug.log: \u201c<DATE> No eligible staking transaction found\u201c. It means that you are staking but have not received a reward yet. @miketout will change the message soon.\n\nRegarding time locked coins:\nThe Zcash protocol requires you to send all coins received by mining (on wallet, not pool mining) or staking (reward transactions, also on wallet, not pool staking) once unlocked to a private address and then to a public/transparent address before you can use them either for staking or for making transactions (that\u2019s how you make use of your rewarded coins = coinbase coins). So, once your coins loose their time lock, you can unlock those coins as described in [\"Shield Verus Coins via Command Line Interface]\"(#!how-to/how-to_shield_via_cli.md). Once you've transferred the coins from your private address back to (one of) your public / transparent address(es) and you\u2019ll automatically start staking.\n\n(submitted by @karero, edited by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nnote: last revision date 2020-02-25.",
