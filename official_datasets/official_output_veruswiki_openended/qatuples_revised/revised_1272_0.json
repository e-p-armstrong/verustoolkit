    "What are some key features and benefits of the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and how do they enable new use cases and unlimited scale?",
    "The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network offers several key features and benefits that enable new use cases and unlimited scale. \n\n**Seamless Connectivity:** \nOne of the main benefits is seamless connectivity between different blockchains. This means that fees generated through cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This allows for frictionless interaction between different blockchain networks.\n\n**Blockchain-based Crowdfunding:**\nVerus enables blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds. This means that users can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. This feature also allows for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and pre-launch discounts for early participants.\n\n**Interoperable Multichain Network:**\nThe Verus network enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be available to the world for merge mining and staking. Additionally, private, internal blockchains can be easily set up, with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back. This allows for unlimited scale, as there is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n\nOverall, the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network provides a powerful platform for creating new blockchain-based use cases, with features such as seamless connectivity, blockchain-based crowdfunding, and an interoperable multichain network. These features enable unlimited scale and new possibilities for blockchain-based applications.",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.
