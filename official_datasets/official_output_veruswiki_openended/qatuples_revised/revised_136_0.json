    "How do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus testnet or mainnet, and what are the key features of the new Verus testnet?",
    "To sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus testnet or mainnet, you can follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Create a Transaction and Get Raw Transaction Data**\nFirst, create a transaction using the `sendcurrency` command, specifying the multi-signature ID and the destination address and amount:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\nNext, use the `z_getoperationstatus` command to get the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency`, and retrieve the raw hex transaction data.\n\n**Step 2: Sign the Transaction**\nTake the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs, and sign the transaction using the `signrawtransaction` command:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\nRepeat this step for each additional signature required.\n\n**Step 3: Broadcast the Signed Transaction**\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\nThis will send the signed transaction to the Verus network for processing.\n\n**New Verus Testnet Features**\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers a wide range of features and capabilities. Some of the key features of the Verus testnet include:\n\n* **Easy GUI and Command Line Interface**: The Verus testnet can be accessed through an easy-to-use GUI for basic operations, or a command line interface for more advanced functions.\n* **Unlimited Identities, Currencies, Liquidity Pools, and Blockchains**: The Verus testnet allows users to create an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains, making it a highly scalable and flexible platform.\n* **Multi-Chain Capability**: The Verus testnet enables users to send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease, without the need for an exchange.\n* **Intrinsic Decentralization**: The Verus testnet is an intrinsically decentralized platform, which means that it is not controlled by any single entity or central authority.\n* **DeFi Enabled**: The Verus testnet is DeFi (Decentralized Finance) enabled, which means that it supports decentralized financial applications and services.\n\nOverall, the Verus testnet is a powerful and flexible platform that offers a wide range of features and capabilities, making it an ideal choice for businesses, governments, projects, and individuals looking to build decentralized applications and services.",
