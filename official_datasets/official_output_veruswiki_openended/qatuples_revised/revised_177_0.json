    "What are the different fundraising options available for a new currency launch on the Verus platform, and how do they affect the value of the currency?",
    "When launching a new currency on the Verus platform, there are several fundraising options available. These options allow the currency creator to raise funds for the launch and reward early participants. Here's a breakdown of each option and how they impact the value of the currency:\n\n**Fractionally Backed Currencies:**\nExcept for new blockchain launches, which create native currency for operating the proof of stake, most currencies using fundraising options will be fractionally backed. This means that the currency's value will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it.\n\n**Fundraising Options:**\nThere are three primary fundraising options available:\n\n1. **Pre-launch Discount:** This option offers a discount to early participants who contribute to the launch before it goes live on its start block. This discount is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency remains in demand when it launches.\n\n2. **Pre-launch Carve-out:** This option allows a percentage of each initial participation currency to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price-neutral manner. The carved-out amount is sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.\n\n3. **Pre-allocation:** This option enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price-neutral manner, and the allocated amount is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time-locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods.\n\n**Impact on Currency Value:**\nThe choice of fundraising option can affect the value of the currency. For example, a pre-launch discount can increase demand for the currency, causing its value to appreciate. On the other hand, a pre-launch carve-out or pre-allocation can reduce the reserve ratio, potentially causing the currency's value to depreciate. It's essential to carefully consider the fundraising options and their impact on the currency's value when launching a new currency on the Verus platform.",
    "a percentage of the reserve backing. Except in the case of a new blockchain launch, which creates new native currency for operating the proof of stake of the blockchain, any currency that uses fundraising options will be a fractionally backed currency which will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it. If a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options that are not met, no fundraising is received:\n - Pre-launch discount - all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency. This is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live.\n- Pre-launch carve-out - this enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.\n- Pre-allocation - this enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods.",
