    "What kind of warranty or liability does the Verus software come with, and are there any potential issues with antivirus software flagging it as malicious?",
    "The Verus software is provided \"as is\", which means that it does not come with any warranty or guarantee of any kind. This includes implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Additionally, the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability that may arise from the use of the software.\n\nIt's also important to note that some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software is related to cryptocurrency mining, which can be exploited by third parties to misuse your computer's resources. However, these warnings are false positives, and the software is not actually malicious.\n\nIf you're concerned about these warnings, you can review resources from reputable sources such as Malwarebytes and Kaspersky, which provide more information about these types of false positives. These resources explain that these warnings are typically triggered by the software's mining capabilities, and do not indicate that the software is actually malicious.\n\nIn terms of verifying the safety of the software, you can also check the VirusTotal links provided, which show the detection results from various antivirus engines. These links are specific to the different versions of the Verus software (MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows).",
