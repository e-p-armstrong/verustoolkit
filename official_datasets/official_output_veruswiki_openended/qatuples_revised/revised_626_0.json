    "What are the steps to safely update the Verus daemon to a new version on a Linux system, ensuring that the wallet and blockchain data are preserved?",
    "To update the Verus daemon to a new version on a Linux system, follow these steps to ensure a safe and smooth transition:\n\n**Step 1: Stop the Verus daemon**\nUse the command `./verus stop` to stop the daemon. Verify that it has stopped running by checking the process list with `top`. The `verusd` process should not be listed.\n\n**Step 2: Rename old binaries**\nRename the old versions of the `verus` and `verusd` binaries to preserve them, in case you need to revert to the old version. Use the command `mv verus verus-v0.7.3-9` and `mv verusd verusd-v0.7.2-9` (replace the version numbers with the version being replaced).\n\n**Step 3: Verify renaming**\nUse the command `ls -la` to verify that the old binaries have been renamed.\n\n**Step 4: Unpack new binaries**\nUnpack the binaries for the latest version using the command `tar -xvf Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tar.gz`.\n\n**Step 5: Verify unpacking**\nUse the command `ls -la` to verify that the new binaries have been unpacked in the directory.\n\n**Step 6: Check and update datadir (if necessary)**\nIf your Verus wallet and blockchain data are stored in a non-standard location, such as an external hard drive, check the `VRSC.conf` file to ensure that the `datadir` parameter is correct. If necessary, edit the file using `nano VRSC.conf` and append the correct `datadir` path.\n\n**Step 7: Start the Verus daemon**\nStart the Verus daemon again using the command `./verusd`. You can add other start options as needed, as described in the Verus documentation.\n\n**Step 8: Verify the new version**\nUse the command `./verus getwalletinfo` to verify that the new version is working correctly.\n\n**Step 9: Clean up old binaries**\nOnce you are satisfied that the new version is working, delete the old binaries (or move them to another directory) using the command `rm verus-v0.7.3-9` and `rm verusd-v0.7.3-9`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can safely update the Verus daemon to a new version, ensuring that your wallet and blockchain data are preserved.",
    "7. STOP the Verus daemon\n    ./verus stop\n  Check whether it has stopped running with this command. (To be doubly sure you can also look in the debug file in the )\n    top\n  (This time `verusd` should **NOT** appear in this list.)\n8. Rename the old versions of the binaries (replace the version numbers with the version being replaced)\n  (This ensures you can easily revert to the old version by renaming these files.)\n    mv verus verus-v0.7.3-9\n    mv verusd verusd-v0.7.2-9\n9. Check they have been renamed\n    ls-la\n10. Unpack/unzip the binaries for the latest version\n    tar -xvf Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tar.gz\n11. Check if they have unpacked/unzipped in the directory\n    ls -la\n12. If the directory where your Verus wallet.dat, Chaindata & VRSC.conf files are stored is in a non standard place - eg on a mounted external hard drive - you may have a datadir specified in your VRSC.conf file.\n  Navigate to that directory to check your datadir is still correct. The VRSC.conf file may have been overidden in the update. This ensures the Verus daemon knows where to find the blockchain you have currently saved on your system.\n    cat VRSC.conf\n  If it requires editing, use nano to edit this file\n    nano VRSC.conf\n  & append this to the VRSC.conf file :  \n    datadir=[your custom file path for your mounted hard drive]\n13. Start the Verus daemon again on the new version (add any other start options from https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-01_verusd_options.md)\n    ./verusd\n14. Check the version\n    ./ verus getwalletinfo\n15. Once you are satisfied the new version is working, clean up the older binares (from step 8) by deleting them (or just move them to another directory using the same mv command as step 8)\n    rm verus verus-v0.7.3-9\n    rm verus verusd-v0.7.3-9",
