    "After a release, it's essential to reset the testnet to ensure a clean and stable environment. To do this, you need to delete specific directories depending on your operating system. \n\n**Deleting Directories:**\nBefore running the new update, you need to delete the following directories:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST` and `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\VerusTest`\n\n**Launching the Testnet:**\nAfter deleting the directories, you can launch the testnet using the following command:\n\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST\n```\n\nThis command will start the Verus daemon with the VRSCTEST chain, allowing you to interact with the testnet.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\nPlease note that this is experimental and unfinished software, and you use it at your own risk.
