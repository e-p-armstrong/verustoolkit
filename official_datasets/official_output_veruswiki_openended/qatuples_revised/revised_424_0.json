    "How can I use Verus to send unconverted VRSCTEST to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain, and how can I convert between reserve currency and native currency on these chains?",
    "Verus provides several commands to manage the movement of funds between chains and conversion between reserve currency and native currency. Here's a breakdown of each command:\n\n**Sending unconverted VRSCTEST to an address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain:**\nYou can send unconverted VRSCTEST to an address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain using the `sendreserve` command. This allows you to store VRSCTEST on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain, which can be converted to/from the native coin of that chain later. The command to do this is:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000}'\n```\n**Sending reserve to another chain and converting to native currency:**\nYou can send reserve currency to another chain and convert it to the native currency of that chain at the current market price using the `sendreserve` command with the `tonative` option. The command to do this is:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```\n**Sending reserve currency to an address on the current PBaaS reserve chain:**\nYou can send reserve currency to an address on the current PBaaS reserve chain without any cross-chain operation using the `sendreserve` command. The command to do this is:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{\"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000}'\n```\n**Sending native currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting to reserve currency:**\nYou can send native currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and convert it to reserve currency at the current market price using the `sendreserve` command with the `toreserve` option. The command to do this is:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{\"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"toreserve\": 1}'\n```\n**Sending reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting to native currency:**\nYou can send reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and convert it to native currency at the current market price using the `sendreserve` command with the `tonative` option. The command to do this is:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{\"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```\nThese commands provide a range of options for managing the movement of funds between chains and conversion between reserve currency and native currency on PBaaS reserve chains.",
    "**Sending unconverted VRSCTEST to an address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain for later conversion to/from the native coin.**\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000}'\n```**Sending reserve to another chain and converting a coin from reserve to that chain's native currency at the current market price.**\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```**Sending reserve currency to an address on the current PBaaS reserve chain with no cross-chain operation, Reserve currency on a PBaaS chain is equivalent to and convertible between the native VRSCTEST currency, but may also be sent to and used on PBaaS reserve chains. It will arrive as reserve currency.**\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{\"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000}'\n```**Sending native currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting it to reserve currency at the same time at the current market price.**\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{\"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"toreserve\": 1}'\n```**Sending reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and converting it to native currency at the same time at the current price. It will arrive as native currency.**\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{\"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```",
