    "How do private, internal blockchains work in the Verus network, and what are some advanced features of Verus IDs, such as locking and unlocking, and how do conversion queries work in Verus?",
    "In the Verus network, private, internal blockchains are easy to set up, allowing organizations to bridge public currencies onto their internal private network and back. These private blockchains have all the features and currencies of the public chain, but with restricted access. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on the Verus network, making it a fractal model that enables an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n\nNow, let's dive deeper into some advanced features of Verus IDs.\n\n**Locking and Unlocking IDs:**\nVerus IDs can be locked and unlocked using the `updateidentity` command. There are two types of locks: Time Lock and Time Delay.\n\n**Time Lock:**\nA Time Lock sets the unlock height of an identity, which means that the ID will be locked until a specific block height is reached. To set a Time Lock, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Time Delay:**\nA Time Delay sets a delay in blocks before an ID can be unlocked when its flags are set back to an unlocked state. To set a Time Delay, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nSome important notes about locking and unlocking IDs:\n\n* Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n* A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**Conversion Queries:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that meet certain conditions, such as having at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, a reserve ratio greater than 10%, and all listed currencies as reserves. For example, to retrieve all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that meet the specified conditions.",
    " private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n## Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n## Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n  ```\n  Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
