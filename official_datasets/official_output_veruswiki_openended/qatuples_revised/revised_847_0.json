    "How do I shield a single address and send funds from a shielded address to a transparent address using the Verus command line?",
    "Shielding addresses and sending funds between them is a crucial part of the Verus ecosystem. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it.\n\n**Shielding a Single Address:**\nTo shield a single address, you need to use the `z_shieldcoinbase` command. This command takes two arguments: your R-address (a transparent address) and your zs-address (a shielded address). The format of the command is:\n```\nverus z_shieldcoinbase <YOUR R-ADDRESS> <YOUR zs-ADDRESS>\n```\nOnce you run this command, the funds will be moved from your transparent address to your shielded address. This process needs to be confirmed on the blockchain before you can use the shielded funds.\n\n**Sending Funds from a Shielded Address:**\nTo send funds from a shielded address to a transparent address, you need to use the `z_sendmany` command. This command takes two arguments: the shielded address you want to send from and a JSON object specifying the amount and destination of the funds. The format of the command is:\n```\nverus z_sendmany <YOUR zs-ADDRESS> '[{\"amount\":<AMOUNT>,\"address\":<DESTINATION ADDRESS>}]'\n```\nReplace `<YOUR zs-ADDRESS>` with your shielded address, `<AMOUNT>` with the amount of Verus you want to send, and `<DESTINATION ADDRESS>` with the transparent address you want to send to. For example:\n```\nverus z_sendmany zcZpfuzzJqmNJ3fUJekvbnyuxuJe9eAURAHrMCvN2Nr7VuWjakb1LEw6j2etPcCnr45BRot7MaMbipuS5da162BfuUkFGxx '[{\"amount\":10,\"address\":\"Verus Coin Foundation@\"}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 Verus from the specified shielded address to the transparent address `Verus Coin Foundation@`.\n\nNote that the funds sent to a transparent address are eligible for staking, which means they can be used to participate in the Verus proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and earn rewards.",
    "To just shield a single address, specify that as the first argument:\n\n`verus z_shieldcoinbase <YOUR R-ADDRESS> <YOUR zs-ADDRESS>`\n\nOnce the funds have moved to the zaddr and are confirmed, you can freely send them to any address, They will be eligble for staking id sent to a transpartent address (R-address).\n\nTo send from a certain zaddr to a transparent address, use z_sendmany. The following command sends 10 Verus to a given transparent address, ID address or ID-name.\nExample: `verus z_sendmany zcZpfuzzJqmNJ3fUJekvbnyuxuJe9eAURAHrMCvN2Nr7VuWjakb1LEw6j2etPcCnr45BRot7MaMbipuS5da162BfuUkFGxx '[{\"amount\":10,\"address\":\"Verus Coin Foundation@\"}]'`\n\nNote: revision date 2020-02-12.",
