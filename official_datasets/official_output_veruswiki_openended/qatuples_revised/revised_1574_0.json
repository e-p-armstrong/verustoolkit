    "What are the requirements and rules for defining a new chain on the Verus network, and how can I create a new chain with a premine and conversion of contributions to the native chain currency?",
    "When defining a new chain on the Verus network, there are several requirements and rules to keep in mind. Firstly, a minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations is required, and each block of notarization must have a minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST. Additionally, VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet to create a chain.\n\nTo create a new chain, you can use the `definechain` command with Verus. The command takes a JSON object as an argument, which defines the properties of the new chain. Here's an example of how to define a chain with a premine and conversion of contributions to the native chain currency:\n\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{\"name\":\"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\",\"premine\":50000000000000,\"initialcontribution\":5000000000000,\"conversion\":100000000,\"minpreconvert\":45000000000000,\"maxpreconvert\":100000000000000,\"launchfee\":0,\"billingperiod\":14400,\"notarizationreward\":100000000000,\"eras\":[{\"reward\":5000000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0,\"eraoptions\":1}],\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"ipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"2ndipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"}]}'\n```\n\nThis example defines a chain named \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\" with a premine of 50,000,000,000,000 VRSCTEST to the specified payment address. The chain also has a conversion mechanism that converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.\n\nNote that the chain definition includes several important properties, such as:\n\n* `name`: the name of the chain\n* `paymentaddress`: the address that will receive the premine and other payments\n* `premine`: the amount of VRSCTEST to be emitted as a premine\n* `initialcontribution`: the initial contribution amount\n* `conversion`: the conversion rate for contributions to the native chain currency\n* `minpreconvert` and `maxpreconvert`: the minimum and maximum amounts that can be converted\n* `launchfee`: the fee for launching the chain\n* `billingperiod`: the billing period for the chain\n* `notarizationreward`: the reward for notarizing blocks on the chain\n* `eras`: an array of era definitions, which specify the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each era\n* `nodes`: an array of node definitions, which specify the network addresses and payment addresses for each node on the chain",
    "- Maximum of 3 eras\n- Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations.\n- Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.\nVRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.**Sample chain definition:**\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{\"name\":\"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\",\"premine\":50000000000000,\"initialcontribution\":5000000000000,\"conversion\":100000000,\"minpreconvert\":45000000000000,\"maxpreconvert\":100000000000000,\"launchfee\":0,\"billingperiod\":14400,\"notarizationreward\":100000000000,\"eras\":[{\"reward\":5000000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0,\"eraoptions\":1}],\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"ipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"},\n{\"networkaddress\":\"2ndipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"}]}'\n```The example above defines a chain that emits a premine to the indicated address and also converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.",
