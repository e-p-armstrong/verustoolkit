    "How can I use Verus to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token, and then later create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST?",
    "With Verus, you can park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token using the `sendcurrency` command. For example, if you want to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token called `gold`, you would use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command effectively parks your conversion until the `gold` token launches. Once the token launches, you will either find the converted amount of `gold` in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nLater, if you want to create a new token called `mycoin` that can be converted to with either `gold` or VRSCTEST, you can do so using the `definecurrency` command. For example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either `gold` or VRSCTEST. The `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. The `currencies` property lists the tokens that can be converted to `mycoin`, and the `minpreconversion` property specifies the minimum amounts of each token needed to convert to `mycoin`. The `initialsupply` property sets the initial supply of `mycoin` to 20,000 units.\n\nWith this setup, you can convert VRSCTEST to `gold` and then to `mycoin`, or convert VRSCTEST directly to `mycoin`. This provides a flexible and powerful way to manage your tokens and conversions within the Verus ecosystem.",
