    "What are some examples of Verus commands and their uses, including pruning spent wallet transactions, rescanning the wallet from a specified height, re-broadcasting unconfirmed wallet transactions, and sending funds from one account to another?",
    "Verus, a decentralized blockchain protocol, offers various commands to manage and interact with the Verus wallet. Here are some examples of Verus commands and their uses:\n\n**Pruning Spent Wallet Transactions:**\nThe `prunespentwallettransactions` command is used to remove spent transactions from the wallet. This can be done in various ways:\n\n* `verus prunespentwallettransactions`: This command prunes all spent transactions from the wallet.\n* `verus prunespentwallettransactions \"1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d\"`: This command prunes a specific spent transaction from the wallet, specified by its transaction ID.\n* Using curl, you can also prune spent transactions by sending a JSON RPC request to the Verus daemon: `curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"prunespentwallettransactions\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/`\n\n**Rescanning the Wallet from a Specified Height:**\nThe `rescanfromheight` command is used to rescan the wallet from a specified block height. This command can take minutes or even hours to complete on very large wallets and rescans.\n\n* `verus rescanfromheight`: This command initiates a rescan of the entire chain.\n* `verus rescanfromheight 1000000`: This command initiates a rescan from block 1000000.\n\n**Re-broadcasting Unconfirmed Wallet Transactions:**\nThe `resendwallettransactions` command is used to immediately re-broadcast unconfirmed wallet transactions to all peers. This command is intended only for testing, as the wallet code periodically re-broadcasts automatically. It returns an array of transaction IDs that were re-broadcast.\n\n**Sending Funds from One Account to Another:**\nThe `sendfrom` command is used to send an amount from an account to a VRSC address. Note that this command is deprecated and should not be used; instead, use the `sendtoaddress` command.\n\n* `verus sendfrom \"fromaccount\" \"toVRSCaddress\" amount ( minconf \"comment\" \"comment-to\" )`: This command sends an amount from an account to a VRSC address. The amount is a real and is rounded to the nearest 0.00000001.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many commands available in Verus. By using these commands, you can manage your wallet, send and receive funds, and interact with the Verus blockchain.",
