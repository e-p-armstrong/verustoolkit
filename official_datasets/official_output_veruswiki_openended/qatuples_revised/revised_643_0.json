    "What are the key features of VerusIDs, including revocation, recovery, and privacy, and how do they contribute to a decentralized and secure identity management system?",
    "VerusIDs are a fundamental component of the Verus ecosystem, offering a range of features that promote decentralized, secure, and private identity management. Three key aspects of VerusIDs are revocability, recoverability, and privacy.\n\n**Revocability:** Each VerusID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity itself. This authority has the permission to revoke the identity, effectively freezing all associated funds and preventing the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered. This feature is particularly useful in cases of key theft, where the revocation authority can intervene to protect the identity's assets.\n\n**Recoverability:** In addition to revocation, each VerusID also includes a separate recovery authority, which defaults to the identity itself. This authority can recover the identity by redefining its primary state and recovery state, but cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority. This ensures that the recovery process is secure and tamper-proof.\n\n**Privacy:** VerusIDs contain a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used for messaging, financial, or voting purposes. Additionally, each ID includes a content map of key-value hashes, designed to work alongside various applications and identity policies. This enables private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when available.\n\nThese features collectively contribute to a decentralized and secure identity management system, where individuals have full control over their identities and associated assets. The built-in decentralized referral program further promotes natural growth and adoption of the Verus ecosystem.",
    "**Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.**Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.**Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.### A Built-in Decentralized Referral Program, Enabling Natural Growth.",
