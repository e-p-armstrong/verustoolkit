    "What are the common errors that may occur when running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution, and how can I resolve them?",
    "When running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution, such as Debian or Devuan, you may encounter errors due to uninstalled dependencies. Specifically, you may see the following error messages:\n```\nerror while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory\nerror while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory\n```\nThese errors occur because the `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries are not installed by default on your Linux distribution. To resolve these errors, you need to install these libraries using the following command:\n```\nsudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev\n```\nOnce you have installed these libraries, you should be able to run `./verusd` without encountering these errors.",
