    "What are the key features and implications of VerusIDs, including their transferability, revocation, recovery, and upgradeability to new address types or signature algorithms?",
    "VerusIDs are a fundamental component of the Verus ecosystem, offering a range of features and capabilities that enable advanced identity management and security. Here are the key aspects of VerusIDs:\n\n**Authority Structure**: A VerusID has three authorities: the primary authority, revocation authority, and recovery authority. The primary authority controls the identity, while the revocation authority can revoke the identity, and the recovery authority can recover a revoked identity.\n\n**Transferability**: VerusIDs are transferable, meaning that the primary authority can be changed, and the identity can be transferred to another party. This transfer can include changes to the revocation and recovery authorities, depending on the permissions of the party updating the ID. When an identity is transferred, all associated funds and transactions are also transferred to the new controlling party.\n\n**Revocation and Recovery**: The revocation authority can revoke an identity, which will freeze all associated funds and transactions. The recovery authority can then recover the revoked identity, but it cannot modify an unrevoked identity or change the revocation authority.\n\n**Upgradeability**: One of the most significant benefits of VerusIDs is their upgradeability to new address types or signature algorithms, such as quantum-secure addresses. When an identity is updated to use a new address type, all transactions sent to that identity will be subject to the new spend conditions, effectively retroactively securing all associated transactions. This feature ensures that identities can be future-proofed against emerging security threats.\n\n**Implications**: The transferability, revocation, recovery, and upgradeability of VerusIDs have significant implications for identity management, security, and flexibility. They enable a high degree of control and autonomy for users, while also providing a robust framework for managing identities and associated assets.",
    "ot modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.\n  - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n  - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.\n3. Identities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party\u2019s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.\n4. If an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using `z_getbalance identity@\u201d`.\n5. If later, a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure s added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well. That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.",
