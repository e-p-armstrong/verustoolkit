    "What is the Verus DeFi Testnet, and what are its features and capabilities?",
    "The Verus DeFi Testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network that is currently available for testing and development. This testnet is a significant milestone for the Verus project, as it introduces many new capabilities and blockchain-first features that have the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry.\n\nOne of the key features of the Verus DeFi Testnet is that it allows for the testing of new 'endcurrency' features, which are now available on both mainnet and testnet. Additionally, the testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses, providing a more comprehensive testing environment.\n\nThe testnet is powered by a hybrid consensus algorithm that combines 50% proof of work and 50% proof of stake, ensuring a secure and decentralized network. It is available worldwide, and all new Verus protocols are being tested and hardened on this network before being deployed on mainnet.\n\nIt's important to note that all currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have no value and may be reset at any time to ensure the integrity of testing for mainnet. However, users can request a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies to try out the new protocols and features by visiting the Verus Discord and asking in the #pbaas-development channel.\n\nOverall, the Verus DeFi Testnet provides a unique opportunity for developers and users to test and experiment with cutting-edge DeFi features and technologies, and to contribute to the development of the Verus ecosystem.",
    "## The Verus DeFi Testnet -- THERE IS NO TESTNET RESET\nAll new 'sendcurrency' features described above now work on both mainnet and testnet. In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well.This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever released, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it\u2019s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel. You can use this link as an invite to the Verus Discord: https://discord.gg/gecZsCf",
