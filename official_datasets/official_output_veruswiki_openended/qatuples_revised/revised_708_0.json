    "What kind of warranty does Verus software come with, and how should I handle potential warnings from antivirus software when installing it?",
    "The Verus software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that the authors or copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use or other dealings in the software.\n\nRegarding the installation of Verus software, it's important to note that some antivirus software may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because Verus is a mining software, and some antivirus programs may detect it as a potential threat to your computer. However, these warnings are false positives, and you can safely ignore them.\n\nTo understand more about these false positives, you can review the resources provided by Malwarebytes and Kaspersky, two reputable cybersecurity companies. They explain that these warnings are simply a result of the software being a mining program, and not a malicious threat to your computer.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Verus provides links to VirusTotal, a website that analyzes files for viruses and malware, to demonstrate that the software is safe to use. You can review the detection results for each platform (MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows) to see that the software has been cleared of any malicious threats.\n\nIn summary, Verus software comes with no warranty, and you should be aware of potential warnings from antivirus software during installation. However, these warnings are false positives, and you can safely ignore them after reviewing the resources provided.",
