    "What are the supported versions of OSX/macOS for Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallet, and how can I uninstall Verus from an unsupported version of OSX/macOS?",
    "The supported versions of OSX/macOS for Verus Desktop are macOS 10.12.x and later. If you try to install Verus Desktop on OSX 10.11.x or earlier, the wallet will not function and will not complete the initial sync. On the other hand, the Verus CLI wallet is expected to run without issues on lower versions of OSX/macOS.\n\nIf you need to uninstall Verus from an unsupported version of OSX/macOS, follow these steps:\n\n1. Quit the Verus wallet application.\n2. Eject the Verus wallet dmg (disk image).\n3. Make a backup of the `wallet.dat` and `VRSC.conf` files if you need to preserve your wallet data.\n4. Move the `Agama.app` file from the Applications folder to the Trash.\n5. Delete the `~/Library/Application Support/Agama` folder by moving it to the Trash or by using the command `rmdir /Users//Library/Application\\ Support/Agama` in the Terminal.\n6. Delete the `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo` folder by moving it to the Trash or by using the command `rmdir /Users//Library/Application\\ Support/Komodo` in the Terminal.\n7. Upgrade your OS to a supported version.\n8. Install Agama.\n\nNote that the Verus wallet data is stored in the `/Users//Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC` directory on Mac OS.",
