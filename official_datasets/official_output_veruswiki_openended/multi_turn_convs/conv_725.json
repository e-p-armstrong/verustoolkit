    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus, but I'm not sure how to use it. Can you provide some examples of how to send and convert funds using this API? Specifically, I'd like to know how to send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, send from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, and convert VRSCTEST to another reserve through a fractional currency.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool for sending and converting funds. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST from a Single Address to a Single Recipient:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to the address `alice@`.\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST from All Private Wallet Funds to Multiple Recipients:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to the addresses `alice@:private` and `bob@:private`.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to a Fractional Basket Currency:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, such as VRSC-BTC, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to VRSC-BTC.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to Another Reserve through a Fractional Currency:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, such as BTC, through a fractional currency, such as VRSC-BTC, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to BTC through the fractional currency VRSC-BTC.\n\nI hope these examples help you understand how to use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus. Let me know if you have any further questions or need more assistance!",
