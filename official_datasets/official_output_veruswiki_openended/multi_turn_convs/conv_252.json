    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating a new currency on the Verus blockchain. Could you walk me through the process of defining and launching a new currency, and what are the requirements for launching a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDefining and launching a new currency on the Verus blockchain is a fascinating topic. To get started, you'll need to use the `definecurrency` command. Here's an example of how to define a new currency called \"gold\":\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency named \"gold\" with specific properties:\n\n* `name`: the name of the currency, which is \"gold\" in this case.\n* `options`: a configurable integer, set to 96 in this example.\n* `currencies`: an array of currencies that can be converted to the new currency, which is VRSCTEST in this case.\n* `conversions`: the conversion ratio between VRSCTEST and GOLD, which is 0.01 in this example.\n* `minpreconversion`: the minimum amount of VRSCTEST required to convert to GOLD, which is 1000 in this example.\n* `preallocations`: a dictionary of pre-allocated amounts for specific identities, which is mike@ with 50,000,000 GOLD in this example.\n\nAfter defining the currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate the currency launch. The currency launch will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and it must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. The mining process will earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD.\n\nOnce the currency is launched, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the `sendcurrency` command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will park your conversion until the token launches, and you will either receive 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\nNote that currently, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option.\n\nDo you have any questions about the process, or would you like more information on any of the specific requirements?",

I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
