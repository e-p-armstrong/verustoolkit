    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get familiar with the `sendcurrency` API on the Verus testnet, and I was wondering if you could walk me through some examples of how to use it to send and convert funds? Specifically, I'd like to know how to send VRSCTEST to specific addresses, convert to fractional basket currencies, and pre-convert to other reserves.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API is a powerful tool in Verus that allows you to send and convert funds on the testnet. I'd be happy to provide some examples of how to use it.\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST to a Single Address:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from a single address to another, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis will send 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to the address `alice@`.\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST from All Private Wallet Funds to Multiple Recipients:**\nIf you want to send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis will send 10 VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to the addresses `alice@:private` and `bob@:private`.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to a Fractional Basket Currency:**\nYou can also use the `sendcurrency` API to convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, such as VRSC-BTC. Here's an example:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis will convert 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to VRSC-BTC.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to Another Reserve through a Fractional Currency:**\nFinally, you can use the `sendcurrency` API to convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, such as BTC, through a fractional currency like VRSC-BTC. Here's an example:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis will convert 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to BTC through the VRSC-BTC fractional currency.\n\n**Pre-Converting VRSCTEST:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API also allows you to pre-convert VRSCTEST to another currency before sending it. This can be useful if you want to ensure that the recipient receives the converted amount. The pre-conversion process is similar to the conversion process, but it happens before the funds are sent.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `sendcurrency` API or any of these examples?",
