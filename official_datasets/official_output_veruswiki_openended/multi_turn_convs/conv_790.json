    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating a new Verus identity. Can you walk me through the steps involved in creating one, and how does the process prevent \"name front running\" by selfish miners?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCreating a new Verus identity is a straightforward process that ensures unique and secure friendly names on a blockchain. I'd be happy to guide you through it.\n\nCreating a new Verus identity is a two-step process that prevents \"name front running\" by selfish miners. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a Verus identity:\n\n**Step 1: Commit to a Name**\nThe first step is to commit to a friendly name for your identity. This commitment is registered on the blockchain, but the name remains secret until you reveal it during the registration process. This approach prevents \"name front running\" by selfish miners, who might try to replace your purchase of an ID with their own purchase of the same name.\n\n**Step 2: Register the Identity**\nTo register your identity, you need to pay a fee of 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has a Verus identity. With a referral, the registration fee is reduced to 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register your identity using the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money is automatically spent along with your registration.\n\nThe registration process reveals your committed name, making it publicly available on the blockchain. The fee paid during registration is used to incentivize miners to secure the network and validate transactions.\n\n**Security Benefits**\nThe two-step process of creating a Verus identity ensures that friendly names are unique to a blockchain and prevents name front running by selfish miners. Additionally, the use of a referral system helps to promote the growth of the Verus community while reducing the cost of identity registration.\n\n**Using Your Verus Identity**\nOnce you have created your Verus identity, you can use your friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash in various CLI commands. For example, you can use your friendly name to send money to other identities or perform other transactions on the blockchain.\n\nDo you have any more questions about creating a Verus identity or how the process works?",

            "## Making a new identity\nArguably, the hardest part of the new Verus identity technology is just making your first identity, especially without a GUI. Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ \u2018[{\u201caddress\u201d:\u201dalice@\u201d, \u201camount\u201d:100}]\u2019\n```\nor\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100\n```\nMaking a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. To prevent this name \u201cfront running\u201d, you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows:",
