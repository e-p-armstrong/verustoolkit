    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how IDs are issued and managed in the Verus ecosystem. Could you explain how decentralized and centralized currencies with a proof protocol of 2 handle ID registration, pricing, referrals, and permission requirements?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to break down the key aspects of ID registration, pricing, referrals, and permission requirements for both decentralized and centralized currencies in the Verus ecosystem.\n\nIn the Verus ecosystem, currencies with a proof protocol of 2 can issue and manage IDs in a decentralized or centralized manner.\n\n**Decentralized Fractional Currencies:**\nFor fully decentralized fractional currencies, the ID registration process is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency. This reduces the supply of the fractional currency and increases its on-chain value relative to its reserves. The minimum price of ID registration can be set in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves, such as USDC or DAI. It's possible to pay more than the minimum price for ID registration, which can include additional features like VDXF key and contract bindings for content or IP licensing.\n\n**Centralized Currencies:**\nCentralized currencies can also issue and manage IDs, but the process is slightly different. The ID registration fee is sent to the currency ID, rather than being burned. Additionally, centralized currencies can set their own rules for ID registration, pricing, and referrals.\n\n**Referral Support:**\nBoth decentralized and centralized currencies can have multiple levels of referral support, up to a limit of 5 levels. This means that when an ID is registered with a referral, the registration fee is reduced, and part of it is divided evenly among the past referrers. For decentralized currencies, the remaining amount is burned, while for centralized currencies, it's sent to the currency ID.\n\n**Permission Requirements:**\nIn some cases, permission from the currency identity is required for ID registration. This means that the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity. Additionally, referrals may be required, which means that an identity registration must have a referral and co-signature of a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.\n\nOverall, the Verus ecosystem provides a flexible and decentralized way for currencies to issue and manage IDs, with options for pricing, referrals, and permission requirements that can be tailored to the needs of each currency.\n\nDo you have any more questions about ID registration, pricing, referrals, or permission requirements in the Verus ecosystem? Or would you like more information on decentralized or centralized currencies?",

            "All fractional and centralized {\u201cproofprotocol\u201d:2} currencies can now issue as a decentralized operation, or with centralized currencies, sell, IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, permission from the currency identity required, which means the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity, or even referrals required, which means that an identity registration must have a referral and co-signature of a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.\nFor fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone.\nThe minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself, or in one of its reserves, for example USDC or DAI.More than the minimum price can be paid for ID registration, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.\nEach currency, either centralized and/or fractional, can have multiple levels of referral support (limit of 5 levels), meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers.
