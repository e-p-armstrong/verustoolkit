    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to experiment with creating my own currency on the Verus testnet. Can you walk me through the process of defining a new currency called \"mycoin\" on the Verus testnet? Additionally, what are the implications of setting the proof protocol to PROOF_CHAINID? And, just in case things go wrong, what steps do I need to take to reset the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDefining a new currency on the Verus testnet is a great way to experiment with the platform. To define a new currency called \"mycoin\", you can use the `definecurrency` command. Here's an example of how you can do it:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nLet me break down what each part of this command does:\n\n* `name` specifies the name of the currency, in this case \"mycoin\".\n* `options` is a configurable integer, in this case set to 97.\n* `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.\n* `currencies` lists the currencies that can be converted to \"mycoin\", in this case VRSCTEST and GOLD.\n* `minpreconversion` defines the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to \"mycoin\", respectively.\n* `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of \"mycoin\" to 20,000 units.\n\nNow, about setting the proof protocol to PROOF_CHAINID: this means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. To mint new coins, you can use the `sendcurrency` command, like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command mints 10,000 new units of \"mycoin\" and sends them to the address \"mike@\".\n\nFinally, if you need to reset the testnet, you'll need to delete the following directories:\n\n**On Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/VRSCTEST\n~/.verustest\n```\nThis will remove all data from the previous testnet and allow you to start fresh.\n\nDo you have any more questions about defining currencies on the Verus testnet, or would you like more information on a specific part of the process?",
