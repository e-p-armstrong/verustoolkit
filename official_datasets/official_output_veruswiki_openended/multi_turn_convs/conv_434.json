    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the differences between Native IDs and non-Native IDs on the Verus platform. Can you explain their capabilities and how they differ in terms of launching currencies and using other features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to clarify the differences between Native IDs and non-Native IDs on the Verus platform.\n\nOn the Verus platform, IDs can be categorized into two types: Native IDs and non-Native IDs. Native IDs are those registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, and they have the ability to launch currencies on that blockchain. In fact, if the Native ID is on the Verus blockchain, it can even launch actual independent blockchains.\n\nOn the other hand, non-Native IDs, which are issued by fractional or centralized currencies, cannot launch currencies. However, they are still valuable for other purposes. They can be used as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs, as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with various features such as identity, NFTs, proofs, brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login. Additionally, they can cross-prove common ownership with other IDs.\n\nThere is an exception to the rule that non-Native IDs cannot create currencies. IDs with the *.veth gateway extension, which are available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter, can create Ethereum-mapped currencies. The registration of these.veth IDs is priced at 100 USD worth of ETH to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Verus platform offers a testnet environment where users can experiment with these features without incurring actual costs. In this testnet environment, users can reset their testnet by deleting specific directories and restarting the testnet daemon.\n\nDo you have any further questions about Native IDs, non-Native IDs, or their capabilities on the Verus platform?",

            "While Native IDs, those registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, will be able to launch currencies on that blockchain, and if on Verus, actual independent blockchains, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, but will still be valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features, for proofs, for brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login, and will have the ability to cross-prove common ownership with other IDs as well.The exception to non-native IDs creating currencies, is that *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter and will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. Registration of .veth IDs will be priced at 100 USD worth of ETH to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.All of these features are currently enabled on the v0.9.3 new testnet. Stay connected on the #pbaas-development channel and participate in the launch at no actual cost as a testnet liquidity provider and get some nice testnet IDs, launch your own currencies, or start your exclusive ID-restricted club, governance group, or business.## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):",
