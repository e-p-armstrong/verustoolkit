    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API on the Verus testnet, but I'm not quite sure how to do it. Can you walk me through how to use this API and provide some examples?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API is a powerful tool in Verus that allows you to send and convert funds on the testnet. This API is used to transfer funds from one address to another, and can also be used to convert funds from one currency to another.\n\n**Warning:** It's important to note that all testnet coins and currencies have no value and will disappear whenever the VRSCTEST network is reset.\n\nTo use the `sendcurrency` API, you need to specify the sender's address, the recipient's address, the currency being sent, and the amount being sent. Here are some examples of how to use this API:\n\n**Example 1: Sending VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient**\nTo send VRSCTEST from a single address (e.g. `bob@`) to a single recipient (e.g. `alice@`), you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command will send 10 VRSCTEST from `bob@` to `alice@`.\n\n**Example 2: Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients**\nTo send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (e.g. `alice@:private` and `bob@:private`), you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":20}]'\n```\nThis command will send 10 VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to `alice@:private` and 20 VRSCTEST to `bob@:private`.\n\nIn general, the `sendcurrency` API is a flexible tool that allows you to send and convert funds on the Verus testnet in a variety of ways. By specifying the sender's address, the recipient's address, the currency being sent, and the amount being sent, you can use this API to perform a wide range of transactions on the testnet.\n\nDo you have any further questions about using the `sendcurrency` API, or would you like more examples of how to use it?",
