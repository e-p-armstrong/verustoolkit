    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to wrap my head around how currencies with a proof protocol of 2 issue and manage IDs. Can you explain how they do it, and what are the options for payment, referrals, and permission requirements?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus, currencies with a proof protocol of 2 (PROOF_CHAINID) can issue IDs as a decentralized operation. This means that the currency can sell IDs using its own currency as the payment currency. There are several options for managing ID issuance, including:\n\n**Payment Options:** The currency can set a minimum price for ID registration, which can be paid in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves (e.g., USDC or DAI). Additionally, more than the minimum price can be paid, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.\n\n**Referral Support:** Currencies can have multiple levels of referral support (up to 5 levels), which means that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred. The referral fee will be divided evenly among past referrers, and the remaining amount will be burned for decentralized currencies or sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.\n\n**Permission Requirements:** ID registration can require permission from the currency identity, which means that the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity. This adds an extra layer of security and control for the currency.\n\n**Decentralized Currencies:** For fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone.\n\nOverall, this system allows for a high degree of flexibility and control for currencies in managing ID issuance, while also providing incentives for referrals and ensuring the security and integrity of the currency ecosystem.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any more questions about how currencies with a proof protocol of 2 issue and manage IDs, or any of the specific options I mentioned?",

            "All fractional and centralized {\u201cproofprotocol\u201d:2} currencies can now issue as a decentralized operation, or with centralized currencies, sell, IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, permission from the currency identity required, which means the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity, or even referrals required, which means that an identity registration must have a referral and co-signature of a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.\nFor fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone.\nThe minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself, or in one of its reserves, for example USDC or DAI.\nMore than the minimum price can be paid for ID registration, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.\nEach currency, either centralized and/or fractional, can have multiple levels of referral support (limit of 5 levels), meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers.
