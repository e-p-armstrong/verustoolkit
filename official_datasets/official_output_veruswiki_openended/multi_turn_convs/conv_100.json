    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus network, and I was also wondering about the key features of the new Verus testnet. Could you walk me through the process of signing transactions and tell me a bit about the testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help.\n\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus network, you can follow these steps:\n\n**Signing Transactions from Multi-Signature IDs:**\n\n**Step 1: Create a transaction and get raw transaction data**\nUse the `verus sendcurrency` command to create a transaction and get the raw transaction data. For example:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\nThis command will return an operation ID. Use the `verus z_getoperationstatus` command to get the raw hex transaction data:\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\n**Step 2: Sign the transaction with additional wallets**\nTake the raw hex transaction data and sign it with each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs using the `verus signrawtransaction` command:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n**Step 3: Broadcast the signed transaction**\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using the `verus sendrawtransaction` command:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\n\nAs for the new Verus testnet, it's a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers a wide range of features. Some of the key features of the Verus testnet include:\n\n* **Easy GUI for basic operations**: The Verus testnet provides a user-friendly graphical user interface for basic operations, making it easy for users to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains.\n* **Command line for advanced functions**: For more advanced users, the Verus testnet also provides a command-line interface for advanced functions.\n* **Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains**: The Verus testnet allows users to create an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains, making it a highly flexible and customizable platform.\n* **Decentralized and multi-chain**: The Verus testnet is a decentralized, multi-chain blockchain platform that allows users to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease.\n* **Currency conversion without an exchange**: The Verus testnet allows users to convert currencies to others on the network without the need for an exchange, simply by sending to themselves and converting along the way.\n\nDo you have any other questions about signing transactions from multi-signature IDs or the Verus testnet?",
