    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus, but I'm not sure how to use it. Can you give me some examples of how to send and convert currencies on the VRSCTEST chain and between chains, including conversions to and from PBaaSChain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert currencies on the VRSCTEST chain and between chains. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST Within the Chain:**\nYou can use `sendcurrency` to send VRSCTEST from one address to another within the VRSCTEST chain. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from `bob@` to `alice@`, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients by using the `*Z` wildcard and specifying the friendly-name z-addresses of the recipients.\n\n**Converting Currencies:**\n`sendcurrency` can also be used to convert VRSCTEST to other currencies, such as fractional basket currencies like VRSC-BTC. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert VRSCTEST to other reserve currencies, such as BTC, through a fractional currency like VRSC-BTC.\n\n**Preconverting to New Currencies:**\n`sendcurrency` allows you to preconvert VRSCTEST to new currencies before they are active. For example, to preconvert 10 VRSCTEST to a new currency called NEWCOIN, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\nThis will park the conversion until NEWCOIN is active, and then complete the conversion.\n\n**Cross-Chain Conversions:**\n`sendcurrency` can also be used to send and convert currencies between chains, such as from VRSCTEST to PBaaSChain. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from VRSCTEST to PBaaSChain, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\",\"amount\":10, \"exportto\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert VRSCTEST to PBaaSChain using the `convertto` and `via` parameters.\n\n**Converting Between Chains:**\nFinally, `sendcurrency` can be used to convert currencies between chains in both directions. For example, to convert PBaaSChain to VRSCTEST, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"exportto\":\"Bridge.VRSCTEST\",\"via\":\"Bridge.VRSCTEST\"}]'\n```\nThese are just a few examples of the many ways you can use `sendcurrency` to send and convert currencies on the VRSCTEST chain and between chains. Do you have any more questions about using `sendcurrency`, or any of these specific examples?",
