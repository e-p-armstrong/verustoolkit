    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in using Verus Desktop to create a PBaaS chain, but I want to make sure I understand the limitations and disclaimers involved. Can you walk me through those, as well as the terms of the software license?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using Verus Desktop to create a PBaaS chain, there are some important limitations and disclaimers to be aware of.\n\nFirstly, there is a limitation to be aware of: if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), you will not be able to use those same currency names for your PBaaS chain. This limitation is currently an errata, but it will be resolved before the mainnet release.\n\nIn addition to this limitation, it is essential to understand that the software is still experimental and unfinished. As such, it is provided \"as is\" without any warranty or guarantee of any kind. This means that the authors and copyright holders are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liabilities that may arise from the use of the software.\n\nRegarding the software license, it grants permission to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software, as long as the enclosed copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. This license does not imply any warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\nIn summary, when using Verus Desktop for PBaaS chain creation, be aware of the current limitation regarding currency names, and understand that the software is experimental and provided without warranty or liability.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these limitations and disclaimers, or would you like more information on the software license?",
