    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about VerusIDs and the VerusHash algorithm. Can you tell me about the key features of VerusIDs, and how the VerusHash algorithm works to equalize performance between FPGAs and CPUs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are indeed a powerful tool, and the VerusHash algorithm plays a crucial role in maintaining a fair and balanced network. Let me break it down for you.\n\nVerusIDs have several key features that make them powerful and flexible. Two of these features are **Recoverable** and **Private**.\n\n**Recoverable**: Each VerusID includes a separate recovery authority, which defaults to the ID itself. This recovery authority can recover the identity by redefining its primary state and recovery state, but it cannot modify the revocation state or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.\n\n**Private**: Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport. These claims and attestations can be attested to with a quantum secure signature when available.\n\nNow, let's talk about the VerusHash algorithm. VerusHash 2.0 was designed to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs. FPGAs were not blocked completely, but the algorithm was developed to ensure that FPGA performance was not significantly better than CPU performance. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to this equalization technology, which is expected to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still allowing FPGAs to operate with minor modifications. The Verus developers have made the new algorithm available to FPGA manufacturers, ensuring that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake on the network.\n\nDo you have any further questions about VerusIDs or the VerusHash algorithm? How they work, or how they can be used in different scenarios?",

            "- **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.- **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.\n# VerusHash 2.1\nVerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.\n# Disclaimer",
