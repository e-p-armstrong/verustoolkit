    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to query a transaction in Verus, but I'm not sure how to use the arguments. Can you explain what they are and what they do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen querying a transaction in Verus, there are two arguments that can be used to customize the query.\n\nThe first argument, \"txid\", is a required string that specifies the transaction ID of the transaction you want to query. This is a unique identifier for the transaction, and it's necessary to provide it in order to retrieve information about the transaction.\n\nThe second argument, \"includeWatchonly\", is an optional boolean value that defaults to false. This argument determines whether to include watch-only addresses in the balance calculation and details of the transaction. Watch-only addresses are addresses that are being monitored by the wallet, but are not controlled by the wallet. By setting \"includeWatchonly\" to true, you can include these addresses in the balance calculation and details, which can provide a more comprehensive view of the transaction. However, if you set it to false or omit it (since it defaults to false), watch-only addresses will be excluded from the calculation and details.\n\nBy using these two arguments, you can customize your transaction query in Verus to retrieve the specific information you need.\n\nDo you have any more questions about querying transactions in Verus, or about these arguments in particular?",
