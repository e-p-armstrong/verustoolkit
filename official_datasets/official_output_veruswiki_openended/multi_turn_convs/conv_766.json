    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble using the `sendcurrency` API in Verus. Can you walk me through how to send and convert currency using this API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API is a powerful tool in Verus that allows you to manage your funds and convert them into different currencies as needed. I'd be happy to explain how to use it.\n\nTo send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to the address `alice@`. The `sendcurrency` command takes two arguments: the source address and a JSON array of transactions. In this case, the source address is `bob@` and the JSON array specifies a single transaction: sending 10 VRSCTEST to `alice@`.\n\nIf you want to send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, you can use the `*Z` wildcard instead of a specific source address. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":20}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to `alice@:private` and 20 VRSCTEST to `bob@:private`. The `*Z` wildcard tells the API to use all available private wallet funds as the source.\n\nNote that the `sendcurrency` API can also be used to convert funds between different currencies. For example, if you want to convert VRSCTEST to another currency, you can specify the target currency in the JSON array. The API will then convert the funds and send them to the specified address.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that all testnet coins and currencies have no value and will disappear whenever the VRSCTEST network is reset. This means that any funds sent or converted on the testnet will be lost when the network is reset.\n\nDo you have any questions about how to use the `sendcurrency` API, or would you like more information on converting funds between currencies?",
