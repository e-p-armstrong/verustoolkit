    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with Verus and I've got a question about the multi-currency features. What are some limitations and considerations to be aware of when working with them, and what steps should I take if I've previously used an older version of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen working with multi-currency features in Verus, there are several limitations and considerations to be aware of. Let me walk you through them.\n\n**Limitation 1: Using i-addresses as ID names**\nIn both the GUI and CLI, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name (not its calculated ID). It is advised to avoid doing this, as it can cause problems when referring to currencies or identities using i-addresses or names. While the protocol does not prevent creating IDs with i-addresses as names, it is not supported for creating currencies and may lead to user confusion.\n\n**Limitation 2: Currency name conflicts in the GUI (temporary errata)**\nIn the GUI, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop (such as BTC or ETH), you cannot use the same name for a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata and will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\nNow, if you've previously used an older version of Verus, it's essential to take some steps to ensure a smooth transition. \n\n**Testnet Reset and Directory Deletion**\nYou need to delete specific directories before running the new update. This is because the testnet was deleted and relaunched, and using older directories may cause issues. The directories to delete vary by operating system:\n\n* On Linux, delete `~/.komodo/vrsctest`.\n* On MacOS, delete `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`.\n* On Windows, delete `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`.\n\nBy being aware of these limitations and taking the necessary steps to update your Verus setup, you can ensure a smooth experience with multi-currency features in Verus.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these limitations or the update process?",

            "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/vrsctest\n```**MacOS**\n```\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest\n```**Windows**\n```\n\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST\n```# Disclaimer",
