    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've got a couple of questions about Verus. What are some limitations of multi-currency in Verus, and also, how do I reset the testnet after an update?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nWhen working with multi-currency in Verus, there are a few limitations to be aware of:\n\n**Limitation 1: ID Names and i-Addresses**\nIn Verus, it's not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity with that i-address calculated based on its name registration. While the protocol doesn't prevent this, it can cause problems in many cases and won't be supported for creating currencies.\n\n**Limitation 2: GUI and PBaaS Chain Names (Temporary Limitation)**\nIn the Verus Desktop GUI, there is a temporary limitation where you can't use the same names as existing currencies (like BTC or ETH) for a PBaaS chain. This limitation is expected to be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\nNow, about resetting the testnet after an update...\n\n**Testnet Reset**\nAfter an update, it's essential to reset the testnet to ensure everything runs smoothly. To do this, you need to delete the following directories:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nBy deleting these directories, you'll be able to start fresh with the updated testnet.\n\nDo you have any further questions about multi-currency limitations or testnet resets? Or maybe something else is on your mind?",

            "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/vrsctest\n```**MacOS**\n```\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest\n```**Windows**\n```\n\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST\n```# Disclaimer",
