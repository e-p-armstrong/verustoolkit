    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus testnet or mainnet, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you walk me through the process? And while we're at it, what are some key features of the new Verus multicurrency, multichain, DeFi enabled testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSigning transactions from multi-signature IDs on Verus can be a bit complex, but I'm here to guide you through it. And, of course, I'd be happy to introduce you to the exciting features of the new Verus testnet.\n\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus testnet or mainnet, you need to follow a few steps:\n\n**Step 1: Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data**\nUse the `verus sendcurrency` command to create a transaction from a multi-signature ID, specifying the destination address and transaction amount. This will return an operation ID. Use the `verus z_getoperationstatus` command with the operation ID to get the raw hex transaction data.\n\n**Step 2: Sign the transaction with additional wallets**\nTake the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and use the `verus signrawtransaction` command to sign the transaction.\n\n**Step 3: Broadcast the signed transaction**\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, use the `verus sendrawtransaction` command to broadcast the signed transaction on the network.\n\nNow, about the new Verus multicurrency, multichain, DeFi enabled testnet:\n\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that allows you to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming. With the Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, you can access the testnet and explore its features, such as:\n\n* Sending currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Converting currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way\n* Creating unlimited identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for various use cases, such as business, government, projects, or decentralized applications\n\nThe Verus testnet marks the beginning of a new era in crypto, offering a wide range of possibilities that are not available on other cryptocurrency platforms.\n\nDo you have any more questions about signing transactions from multi-signature IDs or the features of the Verus testnet?",
