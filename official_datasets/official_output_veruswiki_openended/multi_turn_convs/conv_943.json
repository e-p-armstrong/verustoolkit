    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how IDs are issued and managed in the Verus ecosystem, especially when it comes to decentralized and centralized currencies with a proof protocol of 2. Can you explain how they issue and manage IDs, and what are the options for price, referrals, and permissions in ID registration?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to clarify that for you.\n\nIn the Verus ecosystem, currencies with a proof protocol of 2, which are either fully decentralized or centralized, can issue and manage IDs in a decentralized manner. This means that these currencies can create, manage, and sell IDs using their own currency as the payment currency.\n\nFor fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, which reduces the supply and raises the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves. The minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself or in one of its reserves, such as USDC or DAI.\n\nIn addition to the minimum price, more than the minimum can be paid for ID registration, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.\n\nFurthermore, each currency, whether centralized or fractional, can have multiple levels of referral support (up to 5 levels), which means that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred, and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies, or sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.\n\nRegarding permissions, ID registration requires permission from the currency identity, which means that the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity. Additionally, referrals may be required, which means that an identity registration must have a referral and co-signature of a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.\n\nOverall, this system provides a decentralized and flexible way for currencies to issue and manage IDs, with options for price, referrals, and permissions that can be tailored to the specific needs of each currency.\n\nDo you have any further questions about ID registration or management in the Verus ecosystem?",
