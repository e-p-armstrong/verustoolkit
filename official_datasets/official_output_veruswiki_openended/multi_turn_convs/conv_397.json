    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a new currency on the VRSCTEST chain. Can you walk me through the process of creating a new currency called \"mycoin\"? Also, what are the implications of setting the proofprotocol to 2? And, as a side note, how do I reset the testnet if I need to start over?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCreating a new currency on the VRSCTEST chain is a straightforward process. To create a new currency called \"mycoin\", you can use the `definecurrency` command with Verus. Here's the command you'd use:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nLet's break down the components of this command:\n\n* `name` specifies the name of the new currency, in this case \"mycoin\".\n* `options` is a configurable integer, set to 97 in this example.\n* `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which corresponds to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID has the ability to mint new coins.\n* `currencies` lists the currencies that can be converted to \"mycoin\", in this case VRSCTEST and gold.\n* `minpreconversion` sets the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and gold required to convert to \"mycoin\".\n* `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of \"mycoin\" to 20,000 units.\n\nWith the `proofprotocol` set to 2, the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins using the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command would mint 10,000 new \"mycoin\" units and send them to the address \"mike@\".\n\nAs for resetting the testnet, you'll need to delete the following directories:\n**On Linux:**\n* `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST`\n* `~/.verustest`\n\nThis will remove any existing testnet data and allow you to start fresh.\n\nDo you have any further questions about creating a new currency or resetting the testnet?",
