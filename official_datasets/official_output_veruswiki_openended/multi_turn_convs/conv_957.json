    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a couple of questions about using the Verus command line tool. How do you retrieve currency statistics and prices for a specific block or range of blocks, and what command is used to refund contributions made to a failed PBaaS chain launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nTo retrieve currency statistics and prices using the Verus command line tool, you can use the `getcurrencystate` command. This command can be used in various ways to retrieve different types of data.\n\n**Retrieving data for the most recent block:**\nTo get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate\n```\n**Retrieving data for a specific block:**\nTo retrieve currency statistics and prices for a specific block, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\nReplace `blocknum` with the number of the block you want to retrieve data for.\n\n**Retrieving data for a range of blocks:**\nTo retrieve currency statistics and prices for a range of blocks with a specific period between them, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```\nReplace `startblocknum` with the number of the starting block, `endblocknum` with the number of the ending block, and `blockstostep` with the period between blocks.\n\nNow, regarding refunding contributions made to a failed PBaaS chain launch, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME\n```\nReplace `CHAINNAME` with the name of the failed PBaaS chain.\n\nNote that the software is experimental and unfinished, and use of it is at your own risk.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `getcurrencystate` command or refunding contributions to a failed PBaaS chain launch?",
