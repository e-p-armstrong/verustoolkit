    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get a better understanding of how identities work in Verus. Can you explain how identities work in Verus, and what are the different authorities associated with an identity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIdentities are a crucial part of the Verus ecosystem, and understanding how they work is essential for making the most of the platform.\n\nIn Verus, an identity is a unique entity that can be used as a reference to who you are and as an on-chain destination for funds transfers. An identity consists of a set of addresses (one or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of the identity.\n\nNow, let's dive into the different authorities associated with an identity. Each identity has three authorities associated with it:\n\n1. **Primary Authority**: This is the self-identity and has the power to modify any part of the identity, except for its name, parent (which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined), and the authorities that control it. The primary authority cannot modify data under the control of the other two authorities.\n\n2. **Revocation Authority**: This authority has the power to revoke the primary identity, which will revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control. However, the revocation authority cannot spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n\n3. **Recovery Authority**: This authority has the power to redefine or recover a revoked identity, but it cannot change the revocation authority, nor can it modify an unrevoked identity.\n\nIdentities in Verus are transferable, and when an identity is transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, depending on the authority of the party updating the ID. When an identity is transferred, all funds in transactions under its control will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity.\n\nIn summary, Verus identities are flexible and secure, allowing for multiple authorities to control different aspects of an identity, and enabling the transfer of identities and associated funds between parties.\n\nDo you have any follow-up questions about Verus identities or their associated authorities?",

            " and the same. Your friendly name can be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer.\n2. Each identity must have a set of addresses (1 or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. Each identity also refers to two additional identities that have authority over:\n  - **Primary** - this is the self identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.\n  - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n  - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.\n3. Identities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party\u2019s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.\n4. If an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using \u201cz_getbalance identity@\u201d.\n5. If later, a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure s added to the Verus blockch",
