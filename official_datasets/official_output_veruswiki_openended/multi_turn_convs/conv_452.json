    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I have a couple of questions about Verus. I'd love to know how to sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus network, and also what are the key features of the Verus testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nSigning transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus network involves several steps. First, you need to create a transaction using the `sendcurrency` command, specifying the multi-signature ID and the destination address, along with the transaction amount. Then, you need to get the raw transaction data using the `z_getoperationstatus` command. Next, you need to take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using the `signrawtransaction` command. Finally, after the last necessary signature is applied, you can broadcast the transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command.\n\nRegarding the Verus testnet, it is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers a wide range of features and capabilities. With the Verus testnet, you can create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming knowledge. You can also send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease, and even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way. The Verus testnet is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it marks the beginning of a new age in crypto, offering unlimited possibilities for decentralized applications and use cases.\n\nDo you have any further questions about signing transactions from multi-signature IDs or the Verus testnet?",
