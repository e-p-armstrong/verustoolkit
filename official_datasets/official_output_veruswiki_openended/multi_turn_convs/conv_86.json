    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard about the new Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet. Can you tell me more about its features and benefits? Also, what kind of updates are included in the v0.7.3-3 release?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe new Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers a wide range of features and benefits. This testnet allows users to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for various purposes, such as businesses, governments, projects, or personal use. With the testnet, users can send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease, and even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to themselves and converting along the way.\n\nThe testnet is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, making it easy to use and explore. This platform marks the beginning of a new age in crypto, offering many possibilities that are not available on other cryptocurrency platforms.\n\nRegarding the v0.7.3-3 release, it is a critical update that includes fixes for potential, targeted Denial of Service (DOS) attacks that do not affect overall network security. This update is mandatory for exchanges, pools, and businesses using the Verus network, and previous 0.7.3-x releases should be replaced by this version. Note that this release includes testnet functionality for Verus PBaaS, but it is a mainnet-focused release that does not fix any issues on testnet. Testnet issues will be addressed in upcoming optional releases.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet or the v0.7.3-3 release?",
