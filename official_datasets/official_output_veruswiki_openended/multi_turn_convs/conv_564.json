    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm excited about an upcoming currency launch on the Verus platform, and I want to make sure I'm prepared. Can you walk me through the process of preparing for a currency launch, and what are the requirements for a successful launch? Additionally, how can I convert my Verus coins to the new currency after it launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPreparing for a currency launch on the Verus platform involves a few key steps. Here's what you need to know:\n\nTo prepare for a currency launch on the Verus platform, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate the launch. The launch process happens as part of the mining process, and it requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch successfully. This preconversion process earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD.\n\nBefore the block where the GOLD token launches, you can send a command to park your conversion until the token launches. This command would look like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command effectively parks your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.\n\nAfter the launch, you can create a new token, called mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. To create mycoin, you can use a command similar to the one above, defining the properties of mycoin and its conversion rates with GOLD and VRSCTEST.\n\nIt's important to note that, currently, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option.\n\nDo you have any questions about this process, or would you like more information on creating new tokens on the Verus platform?",
