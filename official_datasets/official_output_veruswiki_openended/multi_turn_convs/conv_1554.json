    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus to send and convert funds. Can you walk me through how to do that and provide some examples?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is indeed a powerful tool that allows users to send and convert funds between different currencies and addresses. I'd be happy to explain how to use it and provide some examples.\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nTo send funds from one address to another, you can use the `sendcurrency` API with the sender's address, the recipient's address, and the amount to be sent. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from `bob@` to `alice@`, you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients by using the `*Z` wildcard and specifying the recipient addresses and amounts. For example:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Converting Funds:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API can also be used to convert funds from one currency to another. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to the fractional basket currency VRSC-BTC using the sender's ID as a funding source, you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert funds to another reserve currency, such as BTC, through a fractional currency like VRSC-BTC. For example:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThese are just a few examples of the many ways you can use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds in Verus. Do you have any specific scenarios in mind where you'd like to use this API, or would you like more examples?",
