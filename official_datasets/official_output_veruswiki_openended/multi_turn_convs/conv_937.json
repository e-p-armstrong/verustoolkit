    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get some information about Verus currency states and also refund some contributions. Can you help me out? How can I get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block, a specific block, or a range of blocks using the `getcurrencystate` command in Verus? And also, how can I refund contributions made to a failed PbaaS chain launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nUsing the `getcurrencystate` command in Verus, you can retrieve the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for different block ranges. Here are the ways to do it:\n\n**Getting the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block:**\nTo get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate\n```\nThis command will return the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block on the specified chain.\n\n**Getting the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for a specific block:**\nIf you want to get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for a specific block, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\nReplace `blocknum` with the specific block number you want to retrieve the data for.\n\n**Getting the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for a range of blocks:**\nTo get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for a range of blocks, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```\nReplace `startblocknum` with the starting block number, `endblocknum` with the ending block number, and `blockstostep` with the number of blocks to step between.\n\nNow, about refunding contributions made to a failed PbaaS chain launch: if you want to refund contributions made to a failed PbaaS chain launch, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME\n```\nReplace `CHAINNAME` with the name of the failed PbaaS chain.\n\nNote that the use of this software is at your own risk, and it is considered experimental and unfinished.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `getcurrencystate` command or refunding contributions?",
