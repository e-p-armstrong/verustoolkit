    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm planning to use Verus Desktop for PBaaS chain creation, but I want to make sure I understand the limitations and disclaimers involved. Can you walk me through those, as well as the terms of the software license agreement?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGreat question! When using Verus Desktop for PBaaS chain creation, there are some limitations and disclaimers you should be aware of.\n\n**Limitations:**\nOne limitation is that if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is temporary and will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\nThe Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and you use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur.\n\n**Software License Agreement:**\nThe Verus software is provided under an open-source license agreement. This means that you are free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, as long as you include the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\n**Warranty Disclaimer:**\nThe software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\n**Liability Limitation:**\nIn no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\nOverall, it's essential to understand these limitations and disclaimers before using Verus Desktop for PBaaS chain creation. Make sure you're comfortable with the terms before proceeding. Do you have any further questions about these limitations and disclaimers, or the software license agreement?",
