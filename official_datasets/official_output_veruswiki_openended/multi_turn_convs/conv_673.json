    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand how Verus handles confidential transactions. Could you explain the different Verus commands related to confidential transactions, and how they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides several commands to facilitate confidential transactions. Here's an overview of each command and how they work:\n\n**`zcrawjoinsplit`**\nThis command performs a joinsplit and returns the JSDescription. The joinsplit is a critical component of confidential transactions, as it allows multiple parties to combine and split funds without revealing the amounts or parties involved. The JSDescription is the output of this command, which can be used to create a confidential transaction.\n\n**`zcrawkeygen` (DEPRECATED)**\nThis command generates a zcaddr, which is a special type of address that can send and receive confidential values. The output includes the zcaddress, zcsecretkey, and zcviewingkey. However, please note that this command is deprecated and should not be used.\n\n**`zcrawreceive` (DEPRECATED)**\nThis command decrypts an encrypted note and checks if the coin commitments are in the blockchain. The output includes the amount, note plaintext, and an \"exists\" flag indicating whether the coin commitments are present on the blockchain. Again, please note that this command is deprecated and should not be used.\n\n**Confidential Transaction Output**\nWhen creating a confidential transaction, the output will include three components: encryptednote1, encryptednote2, and rawtxn. The caller is responsible for delivering the encrypted notes to the appropriate recipients and ensuring that the raw transaction is signed and mined on the blockchain. In the future, a new RPC call will enable the delivery of confidential payments directly on the blockchain.\n\nIn summary, Verus provides a set of commands to facilitate confidential transactions, including joinsplit and key generation. While some of these commands are deprecated, they demonstrate the capabilities of Verus in enabling private and secure transactions.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these commands or how they're used in confidential transactions?",
