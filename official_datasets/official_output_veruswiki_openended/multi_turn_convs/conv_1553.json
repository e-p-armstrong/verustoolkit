    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm about to download Verus, but I want to make sure I'm getting the real deal. What are the steps to verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download, and why may some antivirus software flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerifying the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download is crucial to ensure you're using a legitimate and unaltered version of the software. Here's how to do it:\n\n**Verifying Downloads:**\n\n1. **Extract the downloaded archive**: First, extract the downloaded archive to a directory on your computer.\n2. **Verify the signature**: Next, verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file. This text file contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature.\n3. **Extract the archive to the desired directory**: Once the signature is verified, you can extract the archive to the desired directory on your computer.\n\nYou can use the `verus` command-line tool to verify the file directly or using a checksum. Here are some CLI examples:\n\n**Verifying a file directly:**\n\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"signature\" \"/path/to/downloaded/file.tar.gz\"\n```\n\n**Verifying using a checksum:**\n\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"signature\" \"checksum\"\n```\n\nNow, about those antivirus warnings: some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software includes mining functionality, which may be used by third parties to exploit your computer. However, this is a false positive, and the software is safe to use.\n\nYou can learn more about these false positives by reviewing the resources provided, such as the Malwarebytes blog post on PUP-Optional-BitcoinMiner and Kaspersky's blog post on \"Not-a-virus\".\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that you are using a legitimate and unaltered version of the Verus software. Do you have any more questions about verifying the authenticity of Verus downloads or the antivirus warnings?",
