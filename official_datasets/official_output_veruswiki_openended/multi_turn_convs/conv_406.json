    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating a new currency on the Verus network. Can you walk me through the process of launching a new currency, parking a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, and creating a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLaunching a new currency on the Verus network involves a few steps. I'd be happy to guide you through the process.\n\nTo launch a new currency, you need to fund it with at least 10 VRSCTEST and preconvert 1000 VRSCTEST to the new token at a specified rate. This can be done as part of the mining process, where mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the conversion fees of participation in the launch.\n\nNow, if you want to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to the new token before it launches, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. For example, to convert 100 VRSCTEST to GOLD, you would use:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.\n\nAfter the token launches, you can create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. To do this, you need to define the new token using the `definecurrency` command, specifying the currencies that can be converted to the new token. For example, to create a new token called `mycoin` that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you would use:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\", specifies the currencies that can be converted to it, and sets the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin.\n\nDo you have any questions about this process, or would you like more information on any of these steps?",
