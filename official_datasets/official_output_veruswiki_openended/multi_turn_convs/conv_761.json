    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about how Verus can be used to facilitate token launches, and what are some key features of the Verus multichain network. Additionally, can you explain the concept of locking and unlocking IDs in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides a comprehensive framework for token launches, allowing for the creation of custom token economies with features such as vesting schedules, pre-launch discounts, and more. This is made possible through the use of VerusIDs, which enable decentralized management of token launches.\n\nIn terms of the Verus multichain network, it is designed to be highly scalable and flexible, allowing for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. This is achieved through the use of Notary IDs, which provide decentralized bridge confirmation, enabling seamless interaction between different blockchains. The Verus network can support both public and private blockchains, with the latter allowing for easy setup and bridging of public currencies into an organization's internal network.\n\nThe Verus network operates on a fractal model, which means that there is no theoretical limit to the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate simultaneously. While there may be some overhead associated with cross-notarization, the Verus network is designed to support a high degree of scalability and flexibility.\n\nNow, let's talk about ID locking and unlocking. ID locking allows users to restrict access to their VerusID, either by setting a specific unlock height or by imposing a time delay on unlocking. This can be useful for a variety of use cases, such as securing sensitive information or controlling access to token launches.\n\nThere are two types of ID locking in Verus: time lock and time delay. Time lock allows users to set a specific block height at which an ID will unlock, while time delay imposes a delay on unlocking after the flags are set back to an unlocked state. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of any time delay or unlock height, and a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\nOverall, Verus provides a powerful and flexible framework for token launches and multichain networking, along with advanced features such as ID locking and unlocking.\n\nDo you have any more questions about token launches, the Verus multichain network, or ID locking and unlocking?",

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n## Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencycon",
