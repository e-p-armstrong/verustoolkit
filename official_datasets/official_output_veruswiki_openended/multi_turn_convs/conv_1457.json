    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I just got back into testing Verus after a testnet reset, and I'm not sure what I need to do to get started again. Also, I've seen some warnings and disclaimers around, but I'm not entirely sure what they mean. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter a testnet reset, it's essential to delete specific directories related to Verus to ensure a clean start. The directories to delete vary depending on your operating system:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nMake sure to delete these directories if you've launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current one. Failure to do so may result in issues with your Verus setup.\n\nRegarding the warnings and disclaimers, it's crucial to be aware of them when using Verus. Verus is experimental and unfinished software, and you use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and you should be aware of the following conditions:\n\n* The software is provided \"as is,\" without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n* In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\nBy using Verus, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to these terms and conditions. It's essential to understand that Verus is still under development and may have bugs or issues that could result in losses.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the testnet reset process or the warnings and disclaimers associated with Verus?",
