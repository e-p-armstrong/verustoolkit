    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the advanced features and capabilities of the Verus multichain network. How can VerusIDs be used to manage and control access to these features?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multichain network is a powerful and flexible platform that offers several advanced features and capabilities. Let me walk you through some of the key features and how VerusIDs can be used to manage and control access to them.\n\n**Multichain Network:** The Verus network allows for the creation of multiple public and private blockchains that can interoperate with each other seamlessly. This enables organizations to create their own private blockchains and bridge them with public blockchains, allowing for the easy transfer of assets and data between them. VerusIDs can be used to control access to these blockchains and manage the flow of assets and data between them.\n\n**Notary IDs:** Notary IDs are used to provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking. VerusIDs can be used to manage the creation and deployment of Notary IDs, ensuring that only authorized entities can participate in the bridging process.\n\n**Vesting Schedules:** VerusIDs can be used to include vesting schedules in pre-allocations for token launches, allowing for more control over the distribution of tokens. This ensures that tokens are released according to a predetermined schedule, and that only authorized parties can access them.\n\n**Locking and Unlocking IDs:** VerusIDs can be locked and unlocked using the `updateidentity` command, which allows for the restriction of access to certain features or assets. There are two types of locks: Time Lock and Time Delay.\n\n* **Time Lock:** This sets the unlock height of the identity, allowing for the restriction of access until a certain block height is reached.\n* **Time Delay:** This sets the delay for an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state, allowing for a delay in access to certain features or assets.\n\n**Revoking an Identity:** Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. However, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**Conversion Queries:** The `get` command can be used to query conversion rates and other information related to token launches and vesting schedules. VerusIDs can be used to control access to this information, ensuring that only authorized parties can view or modify it.\n\nOverall, the Verus multichain network offers a high degree of flexibility and control over the creation and management of blockchains, tokens, and identities. VerusIDs play a crucial role in managing access to these features and ensuring the security and integrity of the network.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these features or how VerusIDs can be used to manage access to them?",

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n#### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `get",
