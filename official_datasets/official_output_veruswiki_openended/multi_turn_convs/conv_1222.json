    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with Verus Desktop to create PBaaS chains, but I want to make sure I understand the limitations and disclaimers associated with using it. Can you also tell me about the terms and conditions of using the Verus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using Verus Desktop to create PBaaS chains, there are some limitations and disclaimers to be aware of. \n\n**Limitations:**\nCurrently, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), you will not be able to use those same currency names as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata, and it is expected to be resolved before the mainnet release.\n\n**Disclaimers:**\nThe Verus software is considered experimental and unfinished. As such, it is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\n**Terms and Conditions:**\nThe Verus software is open-source, and permission is granted to anyone obtaining a copy of the software to deal in the software without restriction. This includes the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software. However, the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\n**Liability:**\nThe authors or copyright holders of the Verus software shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\nDid that answer your question? Do you have any further questions about the limitations, disclaimers, or terms and conditions of using the Verus software?",
