    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to use the `getcurrencyconverters` API, but I'm not sure how it works. Can you explain how I can use it to retrieve a list of currencies that meet specific reserve and liquidity requirements, and what are the criteria for a currency to be included in the result?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API is a powerful tool that allows you to retrieve a list of currencies that meet specific reserve and liquidity requirements.\n\nTo use this API, you need to run a command with the `verus` executable, specifying the `getcurrencyconverters` action and the currencies you're interested in. Here's an example of how to use the `getcurrencyconverters` API:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis command will return a list of all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above a certain liquidity threshold.\n\nNow, you might be wondering what the criteria are for a currency to be included in the result. Well, I'm happy to explain!\n\nThe criteria for a currency to be included in the result are as follows:\n\n1. **Minimum reserve requirement**: The currency must have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve.\n2. **Reserve ratio requirement**: The currency must have a reserve ratio of at least 10% VRSC.\n3. **Listed currencies as reserves**: The currency must have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\nBy using the `getcurrencyconverters` API, you can quickly and easily retrieve a list of currencies that meet these criteria, allowing you to make informed decisions about which currencies to use for conversions.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `getcurrencyconverters` API, or would you like to know more about the criteria for currency inclusion?",
