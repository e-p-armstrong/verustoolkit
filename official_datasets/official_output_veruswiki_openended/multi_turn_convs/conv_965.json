    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm a bit worried about updating the Verus bridge on testnet. Can you walk me through the process and let me know what I need to do if I miss the fork?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI totally understand your concerns. Updating the Verus bridge on testnet can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I've got you covered.\n\nWhen the Verus team updates the bridge on testnet, they provide instructions to ensure a smooth transition. In this case, the process involves shutting down the old version of Verus and restarting the notarizations and transaction flow between Ethereum and Verus at a specified time.\n\nTo update successfully, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Shut down the old version of Verus**. Make sure you stop the Verus daemon to avoid any issues.\n2. **Wait for the specified time** (in this case, 5 AM UTC). This is when the update will take place, so make sure you're ready.\n3. **Restart Verus** and let the notarizations and transaction flow between Ethereum and Verus resume. This will get you back on track with the updated bridge.\n\nBut what if you miss the fork at the specified time? Don't panic! You can recover by following these steps:\n\n1. **Stop Verus**. If you haven't already, shut down the Verus daemon to prevent any further issues.\n2. **Delete everything except your `wallet.dat` file** in your data directory. This will remove any conflicting data and allow you to start fresh.\n\nThe data directory location varies depending on your operating system:\n\n* **Linux**: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`\n* **Mac OS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`\n* **Windows 10**: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest`\n\nBy following these steps, you can recover from missing the fork and get back on the correct chain.\n\nAdditionally, the Verus team reminds us that IDs can be exported to a PBaaS chain using the `sendcurrency` command, as shown in the example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nThis command exports an ID to a PBaaS chain, allowing for the transfer of IDs between chains.\n\nDo you have any further questions about updating the Verus bridge on testnet or recovering from a missed fork?",

            "The good news is that throughout the whole process of this first bridge release on testnet, we've been able to update through the issues we've seen without a reset and have not lost a single satoshi of test funds (which is not to say it is fully hardened quite yet). At this point, we hope and believe that this is the last update in this round of testnet, which will allow us to get back to focusing on the mainnet release and not asking those testing to update until we are very close to a mainnet release.Once more, we will ask that you shut down the old version now, and we will restart the notarizations and transaction flow between Ethereum and Verus at 5 AM UTC time.Thank you to everyone who helped with all the testing and exposing of issues that enabled us to make maybe even inconveniently quick progress.If you miss the fork for this version at the above time you can get back on the correct chain by stopping Verus and deleting deleting everything other than your wallet.dat file in your data directory at:\n- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest`## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n  ```",
