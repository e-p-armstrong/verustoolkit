    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds in Verus, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you walk me through some examples of how to use it for different scenarios?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API is a powerful tool in Verus that allows you to send and convert funds between different addresses and currencies. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nTo send funds from a single address to a single recipient, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis will send 10 units of VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to the address `alice@`.\n\n**Sending Funds to Multiple Recipients:**\nTo send funds from all wallet funds to multiple recipients, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis will send 10 units of VRSCTEST to both `alice@` and `bob@` from all available funds in the wallet.\n\n**Converting Funds:**\nTo convert funds from one currency to another, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis will convert 10 units of VRSCTEST to VRSC-BTC and send it to the address `bob@`.\n\n**Converting Funds Through a Fractional Currency:**\nTo convert funds from one currency to another through a fractional currency, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis will convert 10 units of VRSCTEST to BTC through the fractional currency VRSC-BTC and send it to the address `bob@`.\n\n**Preconverting Funds to a New Currency:**\nTo preconvert funds to a new currency before it is active, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\nThis will preconvert 10 units of VRSCTEST to the new currency NEWCOIN and send it to the address `alice@`. If the conversion fails, the funds will be refunded to the address `alice@`.\n\n**Defining a Currency:**\nTo create a new currency, you need to define it using the `definecurrency` command. For example, to define a currency called \"gold\" that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis will define a new currency called \"gold\" with specific properties and initial supply.\n\nNote that the `sendcurrency` API is a powerful tool that requires careful use and understanding of the underlying mechanics. It is recommended to test and verify the results of each command before using it in production.\n\nDo you have any questions about these examples or how to use the `sendcurrency` API in general?",

I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n",
