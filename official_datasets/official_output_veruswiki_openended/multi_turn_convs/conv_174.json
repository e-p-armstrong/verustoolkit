    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand the structure of the result returned by a Verus operation. Could you explain what information it contains about the transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe result returned by a Verus operation is a data structure that contains information about the transaction. It has two possible forms, depending on whether the `returntxtemplate` parameter is set to `true` or not.\n\nLet me break it down for you. \n\n**If `returntxtemplate` is false:**\nIn this case, the result is a simple string that represents an \"operationid\". This operationid can be used to query the status of the operation using the `z_getoperationstatus` command.\n\n**If `returntxtemplate` is true:**\nIn this case, the result is a JSON object with two properties:\n* `outputtotals`: This is a map of currency values, where each key is a currency ticker and each value is the total output amount in that currency. This represents the total outputs of the transaction that need to be input.\n* `hextx`: This is a hexadecimal string that represents the transaction itself, with all specified outputs but no inputs.\n\nIn summary, the result of a Verus operation contains information about the transaction, including an operationid that can be used to query the operation status, and optionally, a template for the transaction with output totals and a hexadecimal representation of the transaction.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the Verus operation result, or would you like more information on how to use the `returntxtemplate` parameter?",
