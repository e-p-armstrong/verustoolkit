    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus to manage my funds. Can you walk me through how to use it to send, convert, and manage funds, including pre-converting to new currencies, sending cross-chain, and converting between chains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool for managing and converting funds within the Verus ecosystem. It allows you to send and convert funds between different addresses, currencies, and even chains. Here are some examples of how to use the `sendcurrency` API:\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nYou can use `sendcurrency` to send funds from one address to another. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from `bob@` to `alice@`, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients by using the `*Z` wildcard and specifying the friendly-name z-addresses of the recipients.\n\n**Converting Funds:**\n`sendcurrency` also allows you to convert funds from one currency to another. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to the fractional basket currency VRSC-BTC, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert funds to another reserve, such as BTC, through a fractional currency like VRSC-BTC.\n\n**Pre-Converting to New Currencies:**\nIf you want to pre-convert your funds to a new currency before it is active, you can use the `preconvert` option. For example, to pre-convert 10 VRSCTEST to the new currency NEWCOIN, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\n**Cross-Chain Transactions:**\n`sendcurrency` also allows you to send and convert funds cross-chain, between different chains in the Verus ecosystem. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from the VRSCTEST chain to the PBaaSChain, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\",\"amount\":10, \"exportto\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert funds cross-chain, for example, from VRSCTEST to PBaaSChain, using the `via` option to specify the bridge chain.\n\nOverall, the `sendcurrency` API provides a flexible and powerful way to manage and convert funds within the Verus ecosystem, including sending, converting, pre-converting, and sending cross-chain.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `sendcurrency` API, or would you like more information on a specific topic?",
