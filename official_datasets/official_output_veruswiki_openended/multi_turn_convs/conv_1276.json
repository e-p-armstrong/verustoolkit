    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still learning about the Verus platform, and I was wondering, what are the differences between native IDs and non-native IDs on the Verus platform, and what are their respective capabilities and limitations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOn the Verus platform, there are two types of IDs: native IDs and non-native IDs. Native IDs are those that are registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, whereas non-native IDs are issued by fractional or centralized currencies.\n\nNative IDs have more capabilities than non-native IDs. They can launch currencies on the blockchain they are registered on, and if they are on Verus, they can even launch independent blockchains. Additionally, native IDs can be used for revocation and recovery of other VerusIDs, as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with various identity and NFT features.\n\nOn the other hand, non-native IDs cannot launch currencies, but they are still valuable for other purposes. They can be used as revocation and recovery IDs for other VerusIDs, and for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with various identity and NFT features. They can also be used for proofs, brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login, and can cross-prove common ownership with other IDs.\n\nHowever, there is an exception to the rule that non-native IDs cannot launch currencies. IDs with the *.veth gateway can be registered in a decentralized manner from the Ethereum bridge converter and can create Ethereum-mapped currencies. The registration of.veth IDs is priced to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with fees going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.\n\nIt's worth noting that these features are currently available on the testnet, and users can participate in the launch at no actual cost as a testnet liquidity provider and get some nice testnet IDs, launch their own currencies, or start their exclusive ID-restricted club, governance group, or business.\n\nDo you have any more questions about native and non-native IDs, or would you like to know more about the testnet and how to get involved?",

            "While Native IDs, those registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, will be able to launch currencies on that blockchain, and if on Verus, actual independent blockchains, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, but will still be valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features, for proofs, for brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login, and will have the ability to cross-prove common ownership with other IDs as well.The exception to non-native IDs creating currencies, is that *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter and will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. Registration of .veth IDs will be priced at a level to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.All of these features are currently enabled on the v0.9.2 new testnet. Stay connected on the #pbaas-development channel and participate in the launch at no actual cost as a testnet liquidity provider and get some nice testnet IDs, launch your own currencies, or start your exclusive ID-restricted club, governance group, or business.## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):",
