    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how to define a new currency on the Verus network. Specifically, I'm curious about the `proofprotocol` parameter. What does it mean to set the `proofprotocol` to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID) when defining a new currency, and how can the controller of the chain ID mint new coins?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen defining a new currency using the `definecurrency` command, the `proofprotocol` parameter determines the rules for minting and managing the currency. Setting `proofprotocol` to 2, which corresponds to PROOF_CHAINID, gives the controller of the chain ID the authority to mint new coins.\n\nIn essence, this means that the controller of the chain ID has the power to create new coins and manage the currency's supply. This can be useful for a variety of use cases, such as managing a token economy or creating a decentralized financial system.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose you define a new currency called \"mycoin\" with `proofprotocol` set to 2. The controller of the chain ID can then mint new coins using the `sendcurrency` command.\n\nTo mint new coins, the controller would use a command like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command would mint 10,000 new units of \"mycoin\" and send them to the address \"mike@\".\n\nSo, to summarize, setting `proofprotocol` to 2 gives the controller of the chain ID the power to mint new coins and manage the currency's supply.\n\nDo you have any further questions about defining currencies or minting new coins on the Verus network?",
