    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm exploring the capabilities of Verus and I was wondering, what are the limitations in creating multi-currencies in Verus, and what are the implications of these limitations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen creating multi-currencies in Verus, there are two important limitations to be aware of.\n\nThe first limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because when referring to a currency, an i-address will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but it will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (in many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce user confusion, the naming system will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.\n\nThe second limitation, specific to the GUI, is that if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata and will not be a limitation in the mainnet release.\n\nIt's also important to remember that the software is still experimental and unfinished, and users should be aware that they use it at their own risk. The software is licensed under an open-source license, which grants permission to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software, subject to certain conditions.\n\nDo you have any further questions about creating multi-currencies in Verus, or would you like more information on these limitations?",

            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
