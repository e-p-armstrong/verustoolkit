    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about token conversions on Verus. How does Verus allow users to park conversions of tokens before they launch, and how can new tokens be created that can be converted to with multiple other tokens?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides a powerful feature that enables users to park conversions of tokens before they launch, and also allows for the creation of new tokens that can be converted to with multiple other tokens.\n\nLet's dive into the details. To park a conversion of tokens before they launch, users can utilize the `sendcurrency` command with specific parameters. For instance, if a user wants to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token called GOLD before it launches, they can use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command effectively parks the conversion until the GOLD token launches. Once the token launches, the user will either find the converted amount of GOLD in their wallet or have their original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nNow, after the launch of the GOLD token, users can create new tokens that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. This is achieved using the `definecurrency` command with specific parameters. For example, to create a new token called mycoin that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, the user can use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\" with specific properties, such as the currencies it can be converted to (VRSCTEST and GOLD), the minimum amounts required for conversion, and the initial supply of the token.\n\nDo you have any further questions about parking token conversions or creating new convertible tokens on Verus?",
