    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit confused about how to convert my VRSCTEST tokens to a new token before it launches, and what happens to my tokens after the launch. Can you help me out? Additionally, how can I create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that! \n\nConverting VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches is a process called \"parking\" the conversion. To do this, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with specific parameters. The command would look like this:\n```\nST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command effectively parks your conversion of VRSCTEST to the new token, in this case, \"gold\". When the new token launches, one of two things will happen:\n\n1. If the token launches successfully, you will receive the converted amount of the new token, in this case, 0.975 GOLD, in your wallet.\n2. If the token launch fails, you will receive your original VRSCTEST amount back.\n\nNow, if you want to create a new token, let's call it \"mycoin\", that can be converted to with either the new token (GOLD) or VRSCTEST, you would use the `definecurrency` command with specific parameters that define the properties of mycoin.\n\nThe `definecurrency` command would look something like this:\n```\ndefinecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines mycoin with the specified properties, allowing it to be converted to with either VRSCTEST or GOLD. The `proofprotocol` set to 2 means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. The `currencies` list specifies that mycoin can be converted to with either VRSCTEST or GOLD. The `minpreconversion` property defines the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin, respectively. Finally, the `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of mycoin to 20,000 units.\n\nDo you have any further questions about parking conversions or creating new tokens?",
