    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm about to download the Verus software, but I want to make sure I'm getting it from a trusted source. How can I verify the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads? Also, I heard there was a recent update to the Verus protocol - what are the benefits of that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerifying the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads is a crucial step to ensure the security and trustworthiness of the software. Verus provides a mechanism to verify the downloads using a digital signature and a checksum.\n\nTo verify a Verus download, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Extract the downloaded archive**: First, extract the contents of the downloaded archive to a directory on your system.\n2. **Verify the signature**: Next, use the `verifyfile` command provided by Verus to verify the signature of the extracted archive. The command takes three arguments: the identity of the signer (in this case, \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\"), the signature, and the path to the extracted archive.\n\nFor example:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AYGcHwABQSCPnizC1yvgpTQCGjoVGNa6DTnFk7Y5cJk4B+UnS8ctLwtxP3HsTvqwR/Hf0TAWFqo3pDc9pBHwfnvVj9ddEDhD /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.3-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.3-x86_64.tar.gz\n```\nAlternatively, you can verify the checksum of the archive using the `verifyhash` command.\n\nFor example:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AYGcHwABQSCPnizC1yvgpTQCGjoVGNa6DTnFk7Y5cJk4B+UnS8ctLwtxP3HsTvqwR/Hf0TAWFqo3pDc9pBHwfnvVj9ddEDhD d167fe2800bfe3da70009ff3861cf2eb7415fa6fb7c3e132bde10161ac3f49dd\n```\nIf the signature or checksum is valid, the command will output `true`.\n\nRegarding the recent update to the Verus protocol, it enables the full use of Ethereum mapped currencies, which allows any currency to become a fully decentralized, auditable stable coin by mapping to DAI, USDT, USDC, or another on Ethereum. This update is highly recommended for mainnet use and critical for testnet use. Additionally, the new website for Metamask support and use from Ethereum now displays all mapped currency options, including those added when someone exports a currency definition to Ethereum, either as a mapped currency or for using any Verus or PBaaS currency as an ERC20.\n\nDo you have any further questions about verifying downloads or the benefits of the recent protocol update?",
