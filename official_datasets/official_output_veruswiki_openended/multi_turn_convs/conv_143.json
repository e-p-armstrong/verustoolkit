Also, I've heard that some antivirus software might flag Verus as malicious - what's the deal with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using Verus software, it's essential to understand the warranties and liabilities associated with its use. The software is provided \"as is,\" without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software.\n\nIn particular, the software does not come with warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. This means that you, the user, assume all risks associated with using the software.\n\nRegarding the antivirus warnings, some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). These warnings are not necessarily indicating that the software is malicious, but rather that it may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC for mining purposes.\n\nIt's essential to understand that these warnings are false positives, and the software is safe to use. You can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives and how to mitigate them.\n\nTo verify the safety of the Verus software, you can check the virus detection results for each platform on VirusTotal, a website that analyzes files and URLs for viruses and malware. The links provided in the text show the detection results for MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows.\n\nIn summary, when using Verus software, you assume all risks associated with its use, and the authors and copyright holders are not liable for any claims or damages. Additionally, be aware that some antivirus software may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP,\" but these warnings are false positives, and the software is safe to use.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the warranties and liabilities, or the antivirus warnings?",
