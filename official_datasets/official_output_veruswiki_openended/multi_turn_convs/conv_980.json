    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to create a new currency using the Verus command line. Could you explain the purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency, and how it enables the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen defining a new currency using the Verus command line, setting `proofprotocol` to 2, which is equivalent to PROOF_CHAINID, allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. This means that the entity controlling the chain ID has the authority to create new coins and add them to the circulating supply of the currency.\n\nLet me provide an example to illustrate this. Suppose we define a new currency called \"mycoin\" with a `proofprotocol` set to 2 using the following command: `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'`.\n\nBy setting `proofprotocol` to 2, we enable the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. To mint new coins, the controller of the chain ID can use the `sendcurrency` command, as shown in the example: `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'`. This command mints 10,000 new coins of \"mycoin\" and sends them to the address \"mike@\".\n\nIn summary, setting `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency using the Verus command line enables the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins, allowing them to control the supply of the currency and perform actions such as creating new coins or incentivizing certain behaviors within the ecosystem.\n\nDo you have any further questions about setting `proofprotocol` to 2 or minting new coins?",
