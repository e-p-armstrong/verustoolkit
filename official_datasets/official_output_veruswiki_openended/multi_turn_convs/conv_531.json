    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about the multi-currency technology preview in Verus. Can you tell me more about its key features and benefits, specifically in terms of the \"sendcurrency\" API, conversion rates, and fees?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe multi-currency technology preview in Verus is a significant development, and I'd be happy to dive into its key features and benefits.\n\nThe multi-currency technology preview in Verus offers several key features and benefits, particularly in the context of the \"sendcurrency\" API.\n\n**Sendcurrency API:**\nThe \"sendcurrency\" API has been enhanced with new multi-currency parameters, allowing for more flexibility and control when sending currencies. The API now includes two new parameters: \"currency\" and \"convertto\". The \"currency\" parameter specifies the source currency of the send, with a default value of \"vrsctest\" on the testnet. The \"convertto\" parameter allows for conversion from one currency to another, either to a fractional currency where it is a reserve or to a reserve of the fractional currency of the source.\n\n**Conversion Rates:**\nOne of the key benefits of this technology is that conversion rates are always the same for all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is no spread between the conversion to and from a currency, ensuring fairness and transparency for all users.\n\n**Fees:**\nThere is a fee of 0.025% for conversions, which goes directly to miners and stakers. Additionally, an implied volatility fee is planned to be implemented in the future, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions. This fee will help to offset the risk of impermanent loss for liquidity providers and ensure that relatively volatile currency baskets are balanced with earnings from implied volatility fees.\n\n**Benefits:**\nThe multi-currency technology preview in Verus offers several benefits, including the elimination of front running, ensuring that all transactions are processed simultaneously and at the same rate. This provides a fair and transparent experience for all users. The implied volatility fee will also help to mitigate the risk of impermanent loss for liquidity providers, making the system more sustainable and reliable in the long run.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the multi-currency technology preview, or would you like more information on any of these specific features?",

            "While Verus daemon v0.7.1-2 has minor improvements for mainnet operation, it offers full support for the new Verus Testnet multi-currency technology preview. On testnet, the new \"sendcurrency\" API, which is already available on Verus mainnet in its simplified form, is enhanced with new multi-currency parameters. The first parameter, \"currency\":\"currencyname\" - where the default on testnet for currency name is \"vrsctest\", specifies the source currency of the send. The next, \"convertto\":\"currencyname\", allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source.# An end to front running\nConversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.",
