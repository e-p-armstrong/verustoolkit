    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm having some trouble understanding how Verus determines the number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging. Can you explain the process and the limitations involved?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help clarify that for you. \n\nIn Verus, the number of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) and notes selected for merging can be limited by the caller. The transparent limit parameter plays a crucial role in this process. If this parameter is set to zero, the behavior of the system changes depending on whether Overwinter is active or not.\n\nBefore Overwinter is active, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option determines the number of UTXOs selected for merging. This option sets a specific limit on the number of UTXOs that can be processed.\n\nHowever, once Overwinter is active, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option is ignored, and the transparent input limit of zero takes precedence. In this case, the number of UTXOs selected for merging is limited based on the size of the transaction.\n\nIt's essential to note that there are consensus rules in place that constrain the maximum transaction size. Before Sapling (a specific technology upgrade) activates, the maximum transaction size is 100,000 bytes. After Sapling activates, this limit increases to 2,000,000 bytes.\n\nIn summary, the number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging in Verus is determined by the transparent limit parameter and the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option, with the latter being ignored once Overwinter is active. The process is also subject to consensus rules that limit the maximum transaction size to ensure the integrity of the system.\n\nDo you have any further questions about this process or the limitations involved?",

            "The number of UTXOs and notes selected for merging can be limited by the caller. If the transparent limit parameter is set to zero, and Overwinter is not yet active, the `-mempooltxinputlimit` option will determine the number of UTXOs. After Overwinter has activated `-mempooltxinputlimit` is ignored and having a transparent input limit of zero will mean limit the number of UTXOs based on the size of the transaction. Any limit is constrained by the consensus rule defining a maximum transaction size of 100000 bytes before Sapling, and 2000000 bytes once Sapling activates.",
