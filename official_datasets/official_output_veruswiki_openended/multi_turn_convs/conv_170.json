    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about the Verus platform. Can you tell me about the Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault, and how they contribute to the security and functionality of the Verus platform?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault are two innovative features of the Verus platform that contribute to its security, sustainability, and functionality.\n\nLet me break them down for you:\n\n**Verus Fee Pooling Technology:**\nThe Verus Fee Pooling technology is a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model that addresses concerns about blockchain security. In this model, all fees from transactions in a block are gathered and added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees. The current block miner or staker then takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool. This approach preserves the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time. This solution ensures that the blockchain security is strengthened, rather than weakened, by providing a sustainable revenue model for miners and stakers.\n\n**Verus Vault:**\nThe Verus Vault is an advanced time-locking feature for identities that provides a theft-resistant workflow of identity management. It enables various use cases, including trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, estate planning, and more. The Verus Vault combines with the revocation and recovery capabilities of VerusID to offer immense possibilities for secure identity management. This feature allows for the creation of complex identity management workflows, such as trusts and vesting schedules, while ensuring the security and integrity of identities on the Verus platform.\n\nIn summary, the Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault are two key features of the Verus platform that contribute to its security, sustainability, and functionality. They provide a sustainable revenue model for miners and stakers, while enabling advanced identity management capabilities and use cases.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these features, or how they enhance the Verus platform?",

            "- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
