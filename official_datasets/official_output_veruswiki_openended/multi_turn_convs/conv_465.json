    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, and I'm curious to know how the Verus DeFi protocol addresses these issues. Additionally, I'd love to know more about its features for launching new blockchains and crowdfunding currency launches.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExcellent questions! The Verus DeFi protocol has some innovative solutions to tackle MEV and front-running, and its features for launching new blockchains and crowdfunding currency launches are quite impressive.\n\nTo address MEV and front-running, the Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This is achieved by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols, providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers. This approach eliminates the opportunity for miners to extract value through front-running, ensuring a fair and transparent process for all users.\n\nNow, when it comes to launching new blockchains and crowdfunding currency launches, the Verus DeFi protocol offers several exciting features. One of the key features is the ability to launch a new blockchain simultaneously with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This bridge converter liquidity pool allows for seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and other blockchains, with all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool being earned on the new blockchain, without any rent going back to the Verus blockchain.\n\nAnother feature offered by the Verus DeFi protocol is the ability to launch crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds. This allows users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimum levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, and price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies.\n\nOverall, the Verus DeFi protocol provides a robust and flexible framework for launching new blockchains and crowdfunding currency launches, while addressing the issues of MEV and front-running, and providing seamless connectivity and fee-based incentives to miners and stakers.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the Verus DeFi protocol or its features?",

Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees.
