    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds in Verus. Can you walk me through some examples of how to use it? Specifically, I'd like to know how to send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, send from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, and convert VRSCTEST to another reserve through a fractional currency.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool for sending and converting funds. Here are some examples to get you started:\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST from a Single Address:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to the address \"alice@\".\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST from All Private Wallet Funds:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients, \"alice@:private\" and \"bob@:private\".\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to a Fractional Basket Currency:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, such as VRSC-BTC, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to VRSC-BTC.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to Another Reserve through a Fractional Currency:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, such as BTC, through a fractional currency, such as VRSC-BTC, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to BTC through the fractional currency VRSC-BTC.\n\nIn general, the `sendcurrency` API allows you to send and convert funds in Verus by specifying the source address, recipient address, amount, and currency. You can also specify additional parameters, such as the conversion currency and reserve, to perform more complex conversions.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `sendcurrency` API, or would you like more information on any of these examples?",
