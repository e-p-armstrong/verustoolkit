    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into the advanced features of Verus, and I'm really interested in learning more about querying fractional basket currencies and enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology. Can you tell me more about these features and how they can be used for various purposes such as arbitrage, investment discovery, and estate planning?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus offers several advanced features that enable users to take advantage of its capabilities. Two such features are system-wide queries for fractional basket currencies and enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology.\n\nLet's dive into each of these features and explore their potential use cases.\n\n**System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies:**\nVerus allows for system-wide queries of fractional basket currencies through its RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters`. This API enables users to instantly query any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This feature enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies and determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity. Users can then convert at the best possible rates worldwide or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.\n\nThis feature can be used for various purposes such as:\n\n* Arbitrage: By querying the entire network of fractional currencies, users can identify opportunities for arbitrage and earn profits by converting currencies at favorable rates.\n* Investment discovery: The API enables users to discover new investment opportunities by identifying fractional currencies with high liquidity and favorable conversion rates.\n* Conversion bargain hunting: Users can use the API to find the best conversion rates for their currencies and convert at the most favorable rates.\n\n**Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology:**\nVerusIDs have been enhanced with Verus Vault technology, which extends the already groundbreaking features of VerusIDs to include an advanced time lock capability. This capability enables users to implement various use cases such as vesting, trusts, and protocols for theft-proofing funds, while still allowing for staking on locked funds. With Verus Vault technology, users can have peace of mind knowing that their funds, identity, and estate planning are protected from lost or stolen private keys.\n\nSome potential use cases of enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology include:\n\n* Estate planning: Users can use Verus Vault technology to create trusts and other estate planning mechanisms that ensure their assets are protected and transferred according to their wishes.\n* Theft-proofing funds: The advanced time lock capability enables users to create protocols that protect their funds from theft or loss, while still allowing for staking and other uses of their funds.\n* Vesting: Verus Vault technology can be used to create vesting schedules for employees, investors, or other stakeholders, ensuring that funds are released only according to pre-defined terms.\n\nOverall, these advanced features of Verus enable users to take advantage of its capabilities and use cases, providing a robust and secure platform for various applications.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these features or how they can be used for specific purposes?",

            "- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.",
