    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to wrap my head around multi-chain and dynamic merge mining on the Verus network. Can you walk me through how to prepare for it, and maybe give some examples of sending and converting currency using the `sendcurrency` API?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPreparing for multi-chain and dynamic merge mining on the Verus network involves understanding the capabilities of the Verus network and its merge mining and multi-chain technology. This technology allows Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies.\n\nTo send and convert currency on the Verus network, you can use the `sendcurrency` API. Here are some examples:\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from a single address (e.g. bob@) to a single recipient (e.g. alice@) using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to multiple recipients:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to multiple recipients (e.g. alice@ and bob@) using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Converting VRSCTEST to another currency:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to another currency (e.g. TESTCOIN) using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"TESTCOIN\"}]'\n```\n**Preconverting to a new currency before it is active:**\nYou can preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency (e.g. NEWCOIN) before it is active using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\nAdditionally, to create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\n\nDo you have any more questions about preparing for multi-chain and dynamic merge mining on the Verus network, or using the `sendcurrency` API?",

            "# Preparing for Multi-chain, Dynamic Merge Mining\nWhile this 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology which was running on testnet last year. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies as well.## Sending and Converting Currency\n**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.\n**Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Converting VRSCTEST to another currency, TESTCOIN:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"TESTCOIN\"}]'\n```\n**Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```## Defining a CurrencyTo create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name.
