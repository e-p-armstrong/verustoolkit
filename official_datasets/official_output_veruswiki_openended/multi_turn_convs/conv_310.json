    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus to send and convert funds. Could you walk me through some examples of how to use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool for managing and transferring funds within the Verus ecosystem. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\nThe `sendcurrency` API allows users to send and convert funds between different addresses and currencies. Let's take a look at some examples:\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to the address `alice@`.\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to the addresses `alice@:private` and `bob@:private`.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, such as VRSC-BTC, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to VRSC-BTC.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve through a fractional currency:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, such as BTC, through a fractional currency, such as VRSC-BTC, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to BTC through the fractional currency VRSC-BTC.\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexibility and power of the `sendcurrency` API in Verus, allowing users to easily send and convert funds between different addresses and currencies. Do you have any further questions about using the `sendcurrency` API, or would you like more examples?",
