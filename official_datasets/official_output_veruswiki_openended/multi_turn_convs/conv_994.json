    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there! I'm interested in launching a new token on the Verus network. Could you walk me through the basic steps to do so, and also explain how I can convert VRSCTEST to the new token?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to guide you through the process.\n\nTo launch a new token on the Verus network, you need to follow a few steps:\n\n**Step 1: Fund the Currency Launch**\nFirst, you need to fund the currency launch with at least 10 VRSCTEST. This is a required step to initiate the currency launch process.\n\n**Step 2: Meet the Preconversion Requirements**\nThe new token launch requires a minimum of 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per unit of the new token (in this case, GOLD). This is a necessary condition for the token to launch successfully.\n\n**Step 3: Send the Launch Transaction**\nOnce the funding and preconversion requirements are met, you can send the transaction to launch the new token. This transaction will be mined into a block, which will trigger the token launch process. The mining process earns a 0.025% conversion fee, which is paid in VRSCTEST.\n\nNow, let's talk about converting VRSCTEST to the new token. After the token launches, you can convert VRSCTEST to the new token (GOLD) using the `sendcurrency` command. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will park your conversion until the token launches. Once the token launches, you will either receive the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST refunded.\n\nIf you want to create a new token (mycoin) that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can define the token properties using the `definecurrency` command. The new token (mycoin) can then be used for transactions and conversions on the Verus network.\n\nDo you have any questions about these steps or the conversion process?",

I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option.
