    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about the capabilities of Verus, and I'm curious about how it enables the creation of new blockchains with features like crowdfunding currency launches, interoperability, and unlimited scale. Can you explain that in more detail?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides a comprehensive framework for creating new blockchains with advanced features, ensuring seamless connectivity and unlimited scalability. Here's how:\n\n**Crowdfunding Currency Launches:**\nVerus allows for blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge). This means that creators can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and vesting schedules in the pre-allocations.\n\n**Interoperable, Multichain Network:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, allowing public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. These private blockchains are easy to set up, with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network, and back. They offer all the features and currencies of the public chain but without the access. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n\n**Seamless Connectivity and Unlimited Scale:**\nVerus ensures seamless connectivity between blockchains, allowing for cross-chain fee conversions and general use of the liquidity pool, with all fees earned on the new blockchain and no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This creates an unlimited scalability model, where new blockchains can be created and interconnected, enabling unlimited use cases and applications. While there is some overhead for cross-notarization, the Verus blockchain network is designed to support an unlimited number of blockchains, making it an ideal platform for creators and organizations looking to build innovative applications.\n\nDo you have any more questions about creating new blockchains on Verus, or how these features can be used in practice?",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access.
