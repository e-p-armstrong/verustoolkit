    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to understand how to use the `getaddresstxids` and `getaddressutxos` commands to retrieve information about transactions and unspent outputs associated with specific addresses on the Verus blockchain. Can you walk me through how to use these commands?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getaddresstxids` and `getaddressutxos` commands are two essential tools for retrieving information about transactions and unspent outputs associated with specific addresses on the Verus blockchain.\n\nLet me break it down for you. \n\n**`getaddresstxids` Command:**\nThe `getaddresstxids` command retrieves a list of transaction IDs associated with one or more addresses on the Verus blockchain. To use this command, you need to provide a JSON object with an array of addresses as a string, where each address is base58check encoded. You can also specify a start and end block height to limit the range of transactions to retrieve.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `getaddresstxids` command:\n```bash\nverus getaddresstxids '{\"addresses\": [\"RY5LccmGiX9bUHYGtSWQouNy1yFhc5rM87\"]}'\n```\nThe result will be a JSON array of transaction IDs associated with the specified address.\n\n**`getaddressutxos` Command:**\nThe `getaddressutxos` command retrieves a list of unspent outputs (UTXOs) associated with one or more addresses on the Verus blockchain. To use this command, you need to provide a JSON object with an array of addresses as a string, where each address is base58check encoded. You can also specify additional options, such as including chain information, friendly names, and verbosity level.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `getaddressutxos` command:\n```bash\nverus getaddressutxos '{\"addresses\": [\"RY5LccmGiX9bUHYGtSWQouNy1yFhc5rM87\"]}'\n```\nThe result will be a JSON array of UTXO objects, each containing information about the address, transaction ID, block height, output index, script, and number of satoshis.\n\nBoth commands can be used with the Verus CLI or via JSON-RPC using `curl` or other tools. By using these commands, you can retrieve valuable information about transactions and unspent outputs associated with specific addresses on the Verus blockchain.\n\nDo you have any questions about how to use these commands, or would you like more information on a specific aspect of their functionality?",
