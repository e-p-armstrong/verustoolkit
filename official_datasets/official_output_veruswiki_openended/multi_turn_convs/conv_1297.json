    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI have a question about using Verus to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token, and then later creating a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST. Can you walk me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that. To park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the `preconvert` option. This will effectively park your conversion until the new token launches.\n\nHere's an example command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command will park the conversion of 100 VRSCTEST to GOLD. When the GOLD token launches, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original 100 VRSCTEST back.\n\nLater, if you want to create a new token called `mycoin` that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can use the `definecurrency` command. Here's an example command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\" with the following properties:\n\n* `name`: The name of the token, which is \"mycoin\".\n* `options`: A configurable integer, in this case set to 33.\n* `proofprotocol`: Set to 2, which means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.\n* `currencies`: An array of currencies that can be converted to mycoin, which includes VRSCTEST and GOLD.\n* `minpreconversion`: An array of minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin.\n* `initialsupply`: The initial supply of mycoin, set to 20,000 units.\n\nWith this definition, you can convert VRSCTEST or GOLD to mycoin, and mycoin can be used for various purposes on the Verus network.\n\nDo you have any questions about this process, or would you like more information on any of the commands or options used?",
