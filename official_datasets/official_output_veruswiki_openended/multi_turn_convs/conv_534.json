    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about Verus Vault, but I'm not really sure what it is or what it does. Can you explain what Verus Vault is, and how it provides decentralized protection and recovery of funds, IDs, and NFTs? And are there any additional features it offers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a decentralized security solution that provides an additional layer of protection and recovery for your funds, IDs, and NFTs on the Verus blockchain. It allows you to lock your VerusID, which means that even with the primary keys, including multisig primary keys, you need to wait for a predetermined unlock time before you can spend or access funds. This delay provides a decentralized solution to the infamous \"5-dollar wrench attack\" by giving the revocation and recovery authority identities time to intervene and revoke and recover the ID in case of an unauthorized unlock.\n\nVerus Vault also provides protection and recovery for your IDs and NFTs, and offers time locks for various purposes such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This means that you can use Verus Vault to preserve your blockchain wealth and assets from common forms of crypto loss or theft, without relying on a bank.\n\nIn addition to its security features, Verus Vault also offers a range of additional features. For example, you can export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the `sendcurrency` command. This command allows you to move an ID to a PBaaS chain, along with a specified amount of currency. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\n\nThis command exports the ID named \"IDNAME@\" to a PBaaS chain named \"PBaaSChainName\", along with 100 units of VRSCTEST currency.\n\nOverall, Verus Vault provides a powerful decentralized solution for protecting and recovering your funds, IDs, and NFTs on the Verus blockchain, and offers a range of additional features that make it a versatile and useful tool for managing your blockchain assets.\n\nDo you have any more questions about Verus Vault, or would you like to know more about any of its specific features?",

            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyoe with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n  ```",
