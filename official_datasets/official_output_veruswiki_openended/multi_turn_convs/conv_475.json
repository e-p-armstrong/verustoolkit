    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating a new currency on the Verus network. Can you walk me through the process of preparing for a currency launch and what the requirements are for launching a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPreparing for a currency launch on the Verus network involves a few key steps. To get started, you'll need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST and have at least 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a certain rate (in this example, 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch. This process is part of the mining process, and mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new currency.\n\nBefore the block where the new currency (in this case, GOLD) launches, you can send a command to effectively park your conversion until the token launches. This is done using the `sendcurrency` command, like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will park your conversion until the GOLD token launches, at which point you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nAfter the currency launches, you can create a new currency (in this example, mycoin) that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. This is done by defining the properties of the new currency, such as its name, options, proof protocol, currencies, and initial supply.\n\nIt's important to note that currently, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. However, the Verus network provides a decentralized and flexible way to create and manage currencies, allowing for a wide range of use cases and applications.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the process of launching a new currency on the Verus network, or would you like more information on any of the steps I mentioned?",
