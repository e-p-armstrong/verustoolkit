    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I just downloaded the Verus software, but my antivirus software is flagging it as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". Should I be concerned? Also, how can I verify the authenticity of the downloaded software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDon't worry about the antivirus warning; it's not necessarily a cause for concern. These warnings are often triggered by the installation of mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. You can review the resources provided to learn more about these false positives.\n\nRegarding the authenticity of the downloaded Verus software, you can verify it using the provided txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. The packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\".\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to verify the download:\n\n1. **Extract the downloaded archive**: First, extract the downloaded archive to a folder on your computer.\n2. **Verify the signature for the extracted archive**: Using the extracted text file, verify the signature for the extracted archive. You can use the `./verus verifyfile` command, followed by the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\", the signature, and the path to the extracted archive.\n3. **Extract the archive to the desired directory**: Once the signature is verified, you can extract the archive to the desired directory on your computer.\n\nAlternatively, you can also verify the download using a checksum. You can use the `./verus verifyhash` command, followed by the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\", the signature, and the checksum value. If the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the downloaded Verus software is authentic and has not been tampered with. Do you have any further questions about verifying the authenticity of the software or dealing with antivirus warnings?",
