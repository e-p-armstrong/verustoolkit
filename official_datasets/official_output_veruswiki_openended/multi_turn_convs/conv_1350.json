    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus to send and convert funds, but I'm not really sure how it works. Can you explain how to use it and provide some examples?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds between different addresses and currencies. Here are some examples of its usage:\n\nThe `sendcurrency` API allows you to specify the source address, destination address, amount, and currency to send or convert. It provides a flexible and powerful way to manage your funds in Verus.\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` API to send funds from one address to another. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from an address named `bob@` to an address named `alice@`, you would use the following command:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n\nYou can also send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses `alice@:private` and `bob@:private`, you would use the following command:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n\n**Converting Funds:**\nYou can also use the `sendcurrency` API to convert funds from one currency to another. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC, using IDs as a funding source, you would use the following command:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC, through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC. For example:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\"}]'\n```\n\nDo you have any questions about these examples or how to use the `sendcurrency` API in general?",
