    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus to send and convert funds, and how to define a new currency using the `definecurrency` command. Could you please walk me through some examples?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool for sending and converting funds between different addresses and currencies. I'd be happy to provide some examples of how to use it.\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nTo send funds from one address to another, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the sender's address, the recipient's address, and the amount to be sent. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 units of VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to the address `alice@`.\n\n**Sending Funds to Multiple Recipients:**\nYou can also send funds to multiple recipients in a single transaction. To do this, you can use the `*` wildcard to specify all wallet funds as the sender, and then list multiple recipients and amounts. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 units of VRSCTEST from the wallet to both `alice@` and `bob@`.\n\n**Converting Funds:**\nYou can also use the `sendcurrency` command to convert funds from one currency to another. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"TESTCOIN\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 units of VRSCTEST to TESTCOIN and sends it to the address `bob@`.\n\n**Preconverting Funds:**\nYou can also preconvert funds to a new currency before it is active. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\nThis command preconverts 10 units of VRSCTEST to NEWCOIN and sends it to the address `alice@`. If the conversion fails, the funds will be refunded to `alice@`.\n\n**Defining a New Currency:**\nTo define a new currency, you need to have an ID of the same name, and you can only define a currency of that name once. For example, let's say you want to define a currency called `gold@` that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold. You can define the currency as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency called `gold@` with specific options and conversion rates. The `preallocation` field specifies that 50,000,000 units of gold should be allocated to the address `mike@`.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `sendcurrency` API or defining a new currency?",

The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start.
