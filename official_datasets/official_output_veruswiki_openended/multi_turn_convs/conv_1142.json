    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got some coinbase transactions that I want to shield, get their balance, and then send them to a transparent address using the Verus command line. Can you walk me through the steps to do this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nShielding coinbase transactions, getting their balance, and sending them to a transparent address using the Verus command line involves a series of steps. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:\n\n**Step 1: Shield Coinbase Transactions**\nTo shield your coinbase transactions, you need to use the `z_shieldcoinbase` command. This command captures all coinbase transactions, which are mined coins that are not yet staking. You need to wait for 100 blocks (minutes) after receiving them before you can move them. The format for this command is:\n```\n./verus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\" my_private_address_without_quotationmarks\n```\nReplace `my_private_address_without_quotationmarks` with your actual private address.\n\n**Step 2: Get the Balance**\nAfter shielding your coinbase transactions, you need to get the balance of your private address. You can do this using the `z_getbalance` command. The format for this command is:\n```\n./verus z_getbalance <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks>\n```\nAgain, replace `my_private_address_without_quotationmarks` with your actual private address. This step is necessary to subtract the 0.0001 VRSC fee from the balance in the next step.\n\n**Step 3: Send the Balance to a Transparent Address**\nNow, you need to send the balance (minus the 0.0001 VRSC fee) to a transparent address. You can do this using the `z_sendmany` command. The format for this command is:\n```\n./verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> '[{\"address\":\"<my_transparent_address>\",\"amount\":<95.9998>}]'\n```\nReplace `my_private_address_without_quotationmarks` with your actual private address, `<my_transparent_address>` with the address you want to send the balance to, and `<95.9998>` with the actual amount you want to send (minus the 0.0001 VRSC fee).\n\n**Verification**\nFinally, you can verify the transaction by using the `z_gettotalbalance` command. The format for this command is:\n```\n./verus z_gettotalbalance\n```\nThis command will show you the total balance of your private address after the transaction. Note that operations from private addresses may take some time to process.\n\nRemember to always use the same private address throughout the process.\n\nDo you have any further questions about shielding coinbase transactions, getting their balance, or sending them to a transparent address using the Verus command line?",
