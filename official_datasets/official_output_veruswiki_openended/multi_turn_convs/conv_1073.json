    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nBefore I start using Verus, I want to make sure I understand some important considerations and warnings about the software. Can you also tell me about the terms of its license?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExcellent question! It's crucial to understand some critical warnings and considerations before using the Verus software.\n\nFirstly, the Verus software is **experimental and unfinished**. This means you should be cautious when using it, and you should not expect it to be fully stable or free of bugs.\n\n**False Positives from Antivirus Software:** Some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This warning is not because the software is malicious, but because it is mining software that could potentially be used by a third party to exploit your computer. You can find more information about these false positives on the Malwarebytes and Kaspersky blogs.\n\n**Portability Fix:** Version 0.5.5c of the Verus software introduces a portability fix that allows mining on CPUs that don't support optimized mining. This means that even if your CPU doesn't support optimizations, you can still mine with Verus, although it may be slower.\n\n**License Terms:** The Verus software is licensed under a permissive license that grants you the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software. However, this license comes with **no warranty**, and you use the software at your own risk. The license explicitly states that the software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Additionally, the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any damages or other liability arising from the use of the software.\n\nIn summary, it's crucial to understand that the Verus software is experimental, and you should be cautious when using it. You should also be aware of the potential false positives from antivirus software and the terms of the license under which the software is provided.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the Verus software, its warnings, or its license terms?",
