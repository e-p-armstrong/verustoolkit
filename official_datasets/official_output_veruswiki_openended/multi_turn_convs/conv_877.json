    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in learning more about Verus Testnet PBaaS multi-currency tokens. Can you walk me through some of the key features and how they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Testnet PBaaS multi-currency tokens offer a wide range of capabilities and features. One of the primary benefits is the ability to create and launch tokens on the Verus network using the `sendcurrency` API. These tokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies, and can accept multiple other coins or tokens for conversion to the new token with payment to the token ID.\n\nLet me break it down further. Token launches can have different conversion prices for pre-launch participation, as well as minimum and maximum participation limits. If the minimum participation is not met by the currency's start block, all participation will be refunded, minus a minimal transfer/network fee, which was already allocated to miners/stakers.\n\nTokens can be controlled by the blockchain and used for various purposes, such as payment models, tickets, point systems, and more. They can also be partially blockchain-controlled, centralized tokens, with currencies that are mintable at any time by the ID behind them. The controlling ID can also receive aggregated outgoing transactions to external systems that both burn coins and pass account data in the process.\n\nThis allows applications to control currency supplies on the public network, whether these applications are external, decentralized networks or centralized custodial systems. In many typical use cases of tokens, including club coins, game tokens, token launches, and more, no programming is required.\n\nTo create a currency of a specific name, an ID of the same name is required. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can define the properties and rules of the currency.\n\nOverall, Verus Testnet PBaaS multi-currency tokens provide a powerful and flexible way to create and manage tokens on the Verus network, with a wide range of features and use cases.\n\nDo you have any more questions about Verus Testnet PBaaS multi-currency tokens, or how they can be used in different scenarios?",

Mainnet approved testnet release is not yet available# Verus Testnet PBaaS Multi-currency TokensThe testnet supports a completely new capability of token definitions and token launches (Kickstarter/Gofundme style, ICO, ITO, IPO, etc.). These tokens can be sent through the Verus protocol using the new 'sendcurrency' API, which works for all currencies in the Verus network. Tokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies as well. Token launches can accept multiple other coins or tokens for conversion to the new token with payment to the token ID. Each token can have a different conversion price for pre-launch participation as well as minimums and maximums of participation. If minimums are not met by the currency's startblock, all participation will be refunded, less a minimal transfer/network fee, which was already allocated to miners/stakers.Tokens can be controlled by the blockchain and used for many purposes, including payment models, tickets, point systems, etc., or they can be partially blockchain controlled, centralized tokens, with currencies that are mintable at any time by the ID behind them.

This will allow applications to control currency supplies on the public network, whether these applications are external, decentralized networks or centralized custodial systems, in many typical use cases of tokens, including club coins, game tokens, token launches, etc., no programming is required.## Defining a CurrencyTo create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can",
