    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in launching a currency on the Verus platform. Can you walk me through the process and let me know what the requirements are for a successful launch?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLaunching a currency on Verus involves a few steps and some specific requirements. Let me break it down for you.\n\nTo initiate a currency launch on the Verus platform, you need to fund a currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending a specific transaction. This transaction will trigger the currency launch process, which will start 50 blocks after the transaction is made (by default).\n\nNow, there are certain requirements that must be met for a successful launch. For instance, a minimum of 1000 VRSCTEST must be pre-converted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD unit in order for the launch to occur. This process is an integral part of the mining process, as mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, which involves converting VRSCTEST to GOLD.\n\nBefore the block where the GOLD token launches, you can send a command to park your conversion until the token launches. This can be done using the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command effectively parks your conversion until the GOLD token launches. Once it launches, you will either find 0.975 GOLD units in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\nAdditionally, if the launch is successful, you can create a new token, mycoin, which can be converted to using either GOLD or VRSCTEST. This can be achieved by defining the properties of mycoin, such as its conversion rates with GOLD and VRSCTEST, and its initial supply.\n\nDo you have any questions about the process or requirements for launching a currency on Verus?",
