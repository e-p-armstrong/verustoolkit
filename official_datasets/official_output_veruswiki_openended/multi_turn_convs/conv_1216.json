    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about DeFi protocols and I'm curious about how Verus addresses some of the issues that plague other protocols. Specifically, how does Verus DeFi address the issues of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, and what features are available for launching new blockchains and liquidity pools?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol takes a unique approach to addressing the issues of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. By ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, Verus provides a solution to these problems. This approach provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n\nBut that's not all! The Verus DeFi protocol also offers several features for launching new blockchains and liquidity pools. For instance, it allows for the simultaneous launch of a new blockchain and a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. The bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but are bound to the launch of the new blockchain and run on the new blockchain. All fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, ensuring seamless connectivity.\n\nAdditionally, the Verus DeFi protocol provides a blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launch mechanism with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge). This allows users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, minus network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, and similarly price-neutral carve-outs.\n\nDo you have any further questions about how Verus DeFi addresses MEV and front-running, or the features for launching new blockchains and liquidity pools?",
