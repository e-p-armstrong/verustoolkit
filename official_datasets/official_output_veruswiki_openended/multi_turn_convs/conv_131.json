    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about the Verus DeFi Testnet, but I'm not entirely sure what it's all about. Can you tell me more about its features and capabilities, and how I can get started with testing and exploring its new protocols?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi Testnet is a fascinating topic, and I'd be happy to dive into its features and capabilities.\n\nThe Verus DeFi Testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network that offers a wide range of features and capabilities for testing and hardening new protocols before they are released on the mainnet. What sets it apart is that it does not have a testnet reset, allowing for continuous development and testing.\n\nSome of the key features of the Verus DeFi Testnet include:\n\n* The ability to source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses\n* The implementation of new 'endcurrency' features that work on both mainnet and testnet\n* A 50% proof of work and 50% proof of stake consensus mechanism\n* Worldwide availability and accessibility\n* A decentralized blockchain network that allows for testing and hardening of new protocols\n\nIt's important to note that all currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet.\n\nIf you're interested in trying out the new protocols and features, you can request a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies on the Verus Discord in the #pbaas-development channel. To get started, you can join the Verus Discord using this link: https://discord.gg/gecZsCf. Once you're a part of the community, you can ask for the testnet currencies and start exploring the new protocols and features on the Verus DeFi Testnet.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the Verus DeFi Testnet or how to get started with testing?",

            "## The Verus DeFi Testnet -- THERE IS NO TESTNET RESET\nAll new 'sendcurrency' features described above now work on both mainnet and testnet. In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well.This is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever released, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it\u2019s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel. You can use this link as an invite to the Verus Discord: https://discord.gg/gecZsCf",
