    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a question about immature blocks in Verus. How can I determine when an immature block will mature, and what is the formula to calculate the days to maturity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDetermining when an immature block will mature in Verus is a straightforward process. To do so, you need to follow a simple procedure. \n\nTo determine when an immature block will mature, you need to get two values: the current block height and the distance to maturity of the transaction in question, also known as \"blockstomaturity\". \n\nHere's how to do it:\n\nFirst, get the current block height, which represents the number of blocks that have been mined so far in the blockchain. Next, get the \"blockstomaturity\" value, which is the number of blocks between the current block height and where the transaction will unlock (mature).\n\nNow, you can apply a simple formula to calculate the days to maturity. The formula is: blockstomaturity / 1440 = days to maturity. This formula gives you the number of days it will take for the transaction to mature.\n\nFor example, if the blockstomaturity is 925558, you can calculate the days to maturity as follows: 925558 / 1440 = 643 days. This means it will take approximately 643 days for the transaction to mature.\n\nBy following this procedure and applying the formula, you can easily determine when an immature block will mature in Verus.\n\nDo you have any more questions about immature blocks or the maturity process in Verus?",

            "# Question: How do I know when an immature block will \"unlock\" (mature)?\n\n## Procedure:\n1. Get the values of the current block height (\"blocks\") and the \"blockstomaturity\" the distance to maturity of the transaction in question. (i.e. the number of blocks between current block height and where it unlocks. You can see the number is decreasing all the time, and if you add it to the current block height you'll see a constant.)\n2. Apply this formula: blockstomaturity / 1440 = days to maturity (unlocking)\n  e.g. 925558/1440=643 days\n\n(submitted by @J Oliver Westbrook, edited by @elvinsophus )",
