    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus, and I'm really impressed with its capabilities. Can you tell me more about some of its additional features, specifically with regards to on-chain launches, token and currency management, identities, NFTs, and marketplaces?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus has several additional capabilities that enhance its functionality and usability. Some of these features include:\n\nVerus has a wide range of features that make it a very powerful platform. Let me break them down for you.\n\n**On-Chain Launches:**\nVerus allows for on-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs. This means that users can create and deploy their own tokens, currencies, and decentralized exchanges directly on the Verus blockchain, without requiring any programming or technical expertise.\n\n**On-Chain Launches of Independent Blockchains:**\nVerus also enables the on-chain launch and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without requiring any programming. This feature allows users to create their own blockchains and connect them to the Verus network, enabling seamless interaction and communication between different blockchain ecosystems.\n\n**Self-Sovereign Identities, NFTs, and Profiles:**\nVerus provides on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles. This means that users can create and manage their own digital identities, store and manage their NFTs, and create profiles that showcase their digital assets and achievements.\n\n**Verus ID and NFT Marketplace:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT marketplace allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain, advertising their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT or posting the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. This marketplace enables decentralized, peer-to-peer transactions, allowing users to execute transactions directly without the need for intermediaries. Additionally, the on-chain model allows owners to select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership.\n\nOverall, these capabilities make Verus a powerful platform for creating and managing digital assets, identities, and blockchain ecosystems, while providing a decentralized and secure environment for users to interact and transact with each other.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these features, or how they can be used in practice?",

            "Thanks to ejuliano#8606 for suggesting the initial idea that led to the realization that these features could be added quite easily and with very little protocol risk. All of these new capabilities have had full coverage testing and validation over the past week thanks to @Asherda\u2019s leadership on that front.Meanwhile, @alexenglish, @monkins1010, @asherda, quipacorn#5205, and others have been working on the Ethereum bridge deployment in preparation for this release. The testnet will transition to the v1.0.1 protocol with no reset required, Monday, May 8, 2023 4:00:00 PM, UTC.\n# Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.",
