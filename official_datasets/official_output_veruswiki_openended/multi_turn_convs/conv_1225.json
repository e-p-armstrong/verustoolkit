    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there, I'm about to download Verus, and I want to make sure I'm getting the real deal. How do I verify the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads? And what's the deal with antivirus software flagging the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerifying the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads is an essential step to ensure you are downloading legitimate software. To do this, you can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands provided by Verus.\n\n**Verifying File Directly:**\nYou can verify the file directly using the `verifyfile` command. This command takes three arguments: the identity of the signer, the signature, and the path to the file to be verified. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AbxTJQABQR+xQsQKWDOIJclDMUHezwk6ghlNOrmDZn5YWoYF4tLodgmAdZu9pefSBP4iCjAm5fFG/6qD44bP0vv1dvdEsz6e\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.9-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.9-x86_64.tar.gz\"\n```\n**Verifying using a Checksum:**\nAlternatively, you can verify the file using a checksum. This method involves calculating the checksum of the file and comparing it with the expected checksum provided by the Verus team. You can use the `verifyhash` command to do this. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AbxTJQABQR+xQsQKWDOIJclDMUHezwk6ghlNOrmDZn5YWoYF4tLodgmAdZu9pefSBP4iCjAm5fFG/6qD44bP0vv1dvdEsz6e\" dc0b5adb8bf5f3375e1be7ff10dc35ba34d7af31269c5254157f5ecf0e12635b\n```\nRegarding the antivirus software flagging Verus as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", it's because the software includes mining capabilities, which can be exploited by third parties to misuse your computer resources. These warnings are false positives, and you can safely ignore them.\n\nTo learn more about these false positives, you can review the resources provided by Malwarebytes and Kaspersky.\n\nDo you have any further questions about verifying Verus downloads or dealing with antivirus software warnings?",
