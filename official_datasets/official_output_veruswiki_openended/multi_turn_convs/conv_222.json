    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand how to work with transactions in Verus. Could you explain the `decodescript` and `fundrawtransaction` commands, and how to use them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `decodescript` and `fundrawtransaction` commands are indeed essential tools for working with transactions in Verus.\n\n**Decodescript Command:**\nThe `decodescript` command is used to decode a hex-encoded script and extract information about it. This command takes a single argument, which is the hex-encoded script string. The output of this command is a JSON object that contains information about the script, including:\n\n* `asm`: The script public key in assembly language format.\n* `hex`: The hex-encoded public key.\n* `type`: The output type of the script.\n* `reqSigs`: The required number of signatures for the script.\n* `addresses`: An array of Komodo addresses associated with the script.\n* `p2sh`: The script address in Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) format.\n\nYou can use the `decodescript` command from the Verus command line or by sending a JSON-RPC request to the Verus server.\n\n**Fundrawtransaction Command:**\nThe `fundrawtransaction` command is used to add inputs to a transaction until it has enough value to meet its output value. This command takes four arguments:\n\n* `hexstring`: The hex string of the raw transaction.\n* `objectarray`: An optional UTXO list to select from for funding.\n* `changeaddress`: An optional address to send change to if there is any.\n* `explicitfee`: An optional explicit fee to offer instead of the default fee.\n\nThe output of this command is a JSON object that contains information about the resulting transaction, including:\n\n* `hex`: The resulting raw transaction in hex-encoded string format.\n* `fee`: The fee added to the transaction.\n* `changepos`: The position of the added change output, or -1 if no change output was added.\n\nNote that the `fundrawtransaction` command does not modify existing inputs and adds one change output to the outputs. The inputs added by this command are not signed, so you may need to use the `signrawtransaction` command to sign them.\n\nDo you have any specific use cases in mind for these commands, or would you like more information on how to use them in different scenarios?",
