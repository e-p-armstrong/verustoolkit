    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got two questions. First, how do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs? And second, what are the features of the new Verus multicurrency, multichain, DeFi enabled testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help with both questions!\n\n**Signing Transactions from Multi-Signature IDs:**\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Create a transaction**\nFirst, create a transaction using the `verus sendcurrency` command, specifying the multi-signature ID and the destination address, as well as the transaction amount.\n\n**Step 2: Get the raw transaction data**\nNext, use the `verus z_getoperationstatus` command to get the raw hex transaction data. This will provide you with the raw transaction data that needs to be signed.\n\n**Step 3: Sign the transaction**\nTake the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using the `verus signrawtransaction` command.\n\n**Step 4: Broadcast the signed transaction**\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using the `verus sendrawtransaction` command.\n\n**Features of the New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet:**\nRegarding the new Verus multicurrency, multichain, DeFi enabled testnet, it offers a range of features that make it a powerful and flexible platform for creating and managing decentralized applications. Some of the key features include:\n\n* **Easy GUI for basic operations**: The testnet provides a user-friendly graphical interface for performing basic operations, making it accessible to a wide range of users.\n* **Command line for advanced functions**: For more advanced users, the testnet also provides a command-line interface for performing advanced functions and customizing the platform to meet specific needs.\n* **Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains**: The testnet allows users to create an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains, making it a highly scalable and flexible platform.\n* **Send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains**: The testnet enables users to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease, making it a highly interoperable platform.\n* **Convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange**: The testnet also allows users to convert currencies to others on the network without the need for an exchange, making it a highly convenient and efficient platform.\n* **Accessible from Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets**: The testnet is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, making it easy to use and integrate into existing workflows.\n\nDo you have any further questions about signing transactions from multi-signature IDs or the features of the new Verus testnet?",
