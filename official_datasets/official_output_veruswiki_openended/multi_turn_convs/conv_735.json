    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating my own currency on the Verus network. Can you walk me through the requirements to launch a new currency, and how I can convert my VRSCTEST to the new currency? Additionally, how can I create a new currency that can be converted to with either the new currency or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLaunching a new currency on the Verus network requires some specific steps. To start, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate the launch. The launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction was made (default), and it must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specified rate (e.g. 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch. The launch process is part of the mining process, and mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new currency.\n\nNow, to convert your VRSCTEST to the new currency, you can use the `sendcurrency` command before the block where the new currency launches. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of the new currency in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.\n\nAfter the new currency launches, you can create a new currency that can be converted to with either the new currency or VRSCTEST. To do this, you can define the new currency using the `definecurrency` command, specifying the properties of the new currency, such as its name, options, currencies, and initial supply. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis defines a new currency named \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either VRSCTEST or GOLD.\n\nDo you have any further questions about launching a new currency on the Verus network, or converting between currencies?",
