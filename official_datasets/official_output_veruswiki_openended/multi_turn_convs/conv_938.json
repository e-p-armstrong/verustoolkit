    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been following the Verus testnet and I'm curious about the updates and changes coming to it, particularly in relation to the Ethereum bridge contracts and the path to mainnet for PBaaS. Can you fill me in?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus testnet is indeed undergoing a significant upgrade, and I'd be happy to walk you through the key updates and changes.\n\nThe Ethereum bridge contracts on the testnet are getting a major overhaul to resolve all known issues and make the ETH bridge fully functional. This upgrade is unique to the testnet and won't be needed on the mainnet due to the new contract upgrade model.\n\nYou might know that the testnet has already gone through several challenges, which have led to the development of the Verus Oracle Notification technology. While these challenges have provided valuable experience and increased confidence in the network, they've also left remnants of code in the daemon and final protocol that are only necessary for compatibility with the testnet's history.\n\nTo move forward, it's been decided that a final testnet will be created, but with a different approach. The pre-PBaaS upgrade on the existing testnet will be extended to a future date via the oracles. This will allow for a clean slate on the new testnet, without the historical code remnants.\n\nChain controllers and default oracle controllers should check the #pbaas-development channel for instructions on setting their oracles to extend the upgrade. This will ensure a smooth transition to the new testnet and ultimately to the mainnet for PBaaS.\n\nIn summary, the key updates and changes coming to the Verus testnet include:\n\n* A major upgrade to the Ethereum bridge contracts to resolve known issues and make the ETH bridge fully functional\n* The removal of historical code remnants from the daemon and final protocol to create a clean slate for the new testnet\n* The extension of the pre-PBaaS upgrade on the existing testnet to a future date via the oracles\n* The creation of a new testnet with a different approach, paving the way for the mainnet launch of PBaaS.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these updates or the path to mainnet for PBaaS?",

            "### What\u2019s New for TestNet\nThis release includes an activation that allows a major upgrade to the testnet Ethereum bridge contracts that is both not expected to be needed again on testnet and not ever needed on mainnet with the new contract upgrade model. This upgrade should clear all known issues on the bridge to Goerli, meaning any remaining bridge transactions will be delivered, and the ETH bridge should then be fully functional.### The Path for PBaaS to Mainnet\nThis testnet has actually been through a lot already, more than we expected before mainnet, and this last experience, along with its full restoration of cross-chain and all function has been very useful and was the impetus for the Verus Oracle Notification technology. In the process of getting here, we implemented the necessary changes and fixes to get everything back on track, but we also have remnants of these events in the daemon, and on the final protocol, these are there to enable compatibility with the history of testnet, not because we need these upgrades on mainnet PBaaS. It gave us experience, increased confidence, and pushed us to develop a fast, decentralized network response capability. At the same time, it would be best for our code base, both on the Verus side and in the ETH contracts if that testnet history is removed from the code before mainnet activation. Doing so would make the next upgrade incompatible with today\u2019s testnet and its earlier history.As a result, we have decided that we will create one final testnet, but this time, we would do it a little differently than in the past. We will extend the pre-PBaaS upgrade on the existing testnet to a future date via the oracles. If you have started a chain and control the default oracle on any chain, please check the #pbaas-development channel for instructions on setting your oracle to extend the upgrade.",
