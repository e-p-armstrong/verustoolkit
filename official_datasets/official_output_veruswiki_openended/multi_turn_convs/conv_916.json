    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm having some trouble interacting with a PBaaS chain using the Verus command line. Can you help me out? Specifically, I want to know how to send reserve currency to an address, get currency statistics, and refund contributions to a failed chain launch.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nInteracting with a PBaaS chain using the Verus command line can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I'm here to help. Here are the commands you need to perform those tasks:\n\n**Sending Reserve Currency:**\nTo send reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and convert it to native currency at the same time at the current price, you can use the `sendreserve` command. For example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{\"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```\n\nThis command will send 5000 units of reserve currency to the specified address and convert it to native currency at the current price.\n\n**Getting Currency Statistics:**\nTo get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block, you can use the `getcurrencystate` command. For example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate\n```\n\nThis command will return the current currency statistics for the most recent block.\n\nIf you want to get currency statistics for a specific block, you can specify the block number:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can get currency statistics for a range of blocks with a specific period between them:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```\n\n**Refunding Contributions:**\nIf a PBaaS chain launch fails, you can refund contributions made to the chain using the `refundfailedlaunch` command. For example:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME\n```\n\nThis command will refund contributions made to the specified chain.\n\nDo you have any questions about these commands, or would you like more information on how to use them?",
