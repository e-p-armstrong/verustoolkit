    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm thinking of installing and using the Verus software, but I want to make sure I'm aware of any potential issues or warnings. Can you tell me what I should be aware of, and what are the terms and conditions of using this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, absolutely! When installing and using the Verus software, there are some important warnings and potential issues to be aware of. \n\nFirstly, some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program). This is not because the software is malicious, but rather because it is mining software, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. \n\nIt's essential to understand that these warnings are false positives, and you can find more information about them on the Malwarebytes and Kaspersky websites. Additionally, the Verus software is still experimental and unfinished, so you should use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur.\n\nIn terms of the terms and conditions of using the Verus software, it is open-source and free to use, modify, and distribute. The software is provided \"as is,\" without any warranty or liability. The authors and copyright holders are not responsible for any claims, damages, or other liability that may arise from using the software.\n\nIt's crucial to carefully review the terms and conditions before using the Verus software, and to understand that you are using it at your own risk. Do you have any questions about these warnings or terms, or would you like more information on how to use the software safely?",
