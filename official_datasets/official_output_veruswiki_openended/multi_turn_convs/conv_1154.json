    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about the Verus network and its capabilities. Can you tell me more about its key features and capabilities, including its PBaaS and DeFi protocols, and how developers can utilize them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network is indeed a powerful decentralized, open-source blockchain protocol that offers a range of features and capabilities. With the latest version, v0.9.2, the Verus network, PBaaS, VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols are considered feature complete.\n\nOne of the key features of the Verus network is its 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer, which provides a graphical representation of all currency conversion and fractional network connections, both on-chain and cross-chain. This visualizer allows users to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions, providing a comprehensive view of the network.\n\nThe Verus network also offers a range of PBaaS capabilities, including application development, which are available on the new Verus testnet. The goal of the Verus network is to enable interoperability between different blockchain networks, with the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge being the next target. Developers can utilize the Verus testnet to get a head start on using Verus's transformative technologies, including its PBaaS and DeFi protocols.\n\nThe Verus network's PBaaS capabilities allow developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and deploy them on the Verus network. This enables developers to take advantage of the Verus network's scalability, security, and decentralization features. Additionally, the Verus network's DeFi protocols enable decentralized finance use cases, such as lending, borrowing, and yield farming.\n\nOverall, the Verus network offers a range of features and capabilities that enable developers to build decentralized applications and utilize decentralized finance protocols. With its feature-complete PBaaS and DeFi protocols, the Verus network is poised to revolutionize the blockchain industry.\n\nDo you have any questions about how to get started with the Verus testnet or utilizing the Verus network's PBaaS and DeFi protocols?",

            "## PROTOCOL FEATURE COMPLETE\nWith v0.9.2, The Verus network, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols are considered feature complete for the coming mainnet PBaaS upgrade. The core developer focus now is protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets as well as merge mining for pool servers.## NEW 3D CROSS-CHAIN LIQUIDITY NETWORK VISUALIZER (GUI FOR TESTNET)\nIn v0.9.2 Verus Desktop, there is a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on chain and cross-chain, with the ability to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions. To access the visualizer, click on \u201cVisualize Network\u201d on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop. If you\u2019re interested in seeing the visualizer now, here\u2019s a link directly to the visualizer as part of a recent video members of the community helped make (https://youtu.be/CkgUVjx_g1M?t=43).## NEW PBAAS CAPABILITIES\nAll PBaaS capabilities, including for application development, are available now on the new Verus testnet. Our goal for interoperability on this new testnet is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge in the next couple days. Now would be a good time for development capable projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus\u2019s transformative technologies to do a deep dive on the Verus testnet. These new capabilities in v0.9.2, as well as all those we are familiar with, available nowhere else, will be on mainnet SOON(\u2122):",
