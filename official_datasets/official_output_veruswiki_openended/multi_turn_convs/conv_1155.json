    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm interested in running a Verus Wallet on an ARM device. Can you tell me what the minimum and recommended hardware and software requirements are? And how do these requirements differ for running the wallet on the command line (CLI) versus a graphical user interface (GUI)?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo run a Verus Wallet on an ARM device, there are specific minimum and recommended hardware and software requirements that must be met. These requirements are necessary to ensure that the wallet can function properly and efficiently.\n\nLet's break down the requirements for you.\n\n**Minimum Requirements for CLI Wallet:**\n\nTo run the Verus Wallet on the command line (CLI), the absolute minimum requirements are:\n\n* A 64-bit processor\n* A 64-bit operating system (note that Raspbian is standard 32-bit, so a 64-bit version is required)\n* 2 GB of memory, plus 6 GB of swap space available to the CLI Wallet\n* 20 GB of storage space for the Verus Blockchain and CLI wallet\n* Internet connectivity\n* The `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries installed\n\n**Recommended Requirements for CLI Wallet:**\n\nFor optimal performance, the recommended requirements for running the CLI wallet are:\n\n* A 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled\n* A 64-bit operating system\n* 4 GB of memory or more, plus 6 GB of swap space available to the CLI Wallet\n* 50 GB of storage on a fast medium (such as an NVMe device) for the Verus Blockchain and CLI wallet\n* Internet connectivity\n* The `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries installed\n\n**Minimum Requirements for GUI Wallet:**\n\nTo run the Verus Wallet on a graphical user interface (GUI), the absolute minimum requirements are:\n\n* A 64-bit processor\n* A 64-bit operating system with a GUI interface\n* 2 GB of memory, plus 8 GB of swap space available to the Verus Desktop Wallet\n* 25 GB of storage space for the Verus Blockchain and Verus Desktop\n* Internet connectivity\n* The `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries installed\n\nNote that these requirements may vary depending on the specific use case and the number of PBaaS chains being run. Additionally, it's essential to ensure that the hardware and software meet the minimum requirements to prevent any issues with running the Verus Wallet.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these requirements, or would you like more information on setting up your Verus Wallet on an ARM device?",

            "# Hardware and Software requirement for ARM.\nThere are minimum requirements on your hardware and software for running a Verus Wallet on ARM-devices. If your platform does not meet the minimum requirements, you may not be able to run the required software.The listed requirements are for running **one** chain. Additional PBaaS chains require more resources.## Verus Wallet on CLI#### Absolute minimum requirements:\n* 64-bit processor\n* 64-bit Operating system (Raspbian is standard 32 bit)\n* 2 GB memory + 6 GB Swap available to the CLI Wallet\n* 20 GB storage space for Verus Blockchain and CLI wallet\n* internet connectivity\n* `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries installed#### Recommended requirements\n* 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled\n* 64-bit Operation system (Raspbian is standard 32 bit)\n* 4 GB memory or more + 6 GB Swap available to the CLI Wallet\n* 50 GB storage on a *fast* medium (like NVMe device) for the Verus Blockchain & CLI wallet. This supplies room for blockchain growth over time and the ability to bootstrap the wallet.\n* internet connectivity\n* `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries installed## Verus Wallet on GUI\n#### Absolute minimum requirements:\n* 64-bit processor\n* 64-bit Operating system (Raspbian is standard 32 bit) with GUI interface\n* 2 GB memory + 8 GB Swap available to the Verus Desktop Wallet\n* 25 GB storage space for Verus Blockchain and Verus Desktop.\n* internet connectivity\n* `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries installed",
