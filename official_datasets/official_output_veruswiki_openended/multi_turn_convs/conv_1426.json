    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in learning more about Verus and its capabilities. Can you tell me how Verus enables the creation of new blockchains and manages identity locking and unlocking, and what features does it offer for token launches?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus is indeed a powerful platform that offers several features for creating new blockchains, managing identities, and launching tokens.\n\n**Creating New Blockchains:**\nVerus has a multichain network that allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. These blockchains can be public, available to the world for merge mining and staking, or private, internal blockchains that are easy to set up and bridge with public currencies. The Verus network uses a fractal model, which enables an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains, with some overhead for cross notarization.\n\n**Managing Identities:**\nVerus offers features for locking and unlocking identities. There are two types of locks: time locks and time delays. A time lock is a parameter that defines the unlock height of an identity, which can be set using the `updateidentity` command. A time delay, on the other hand, is a parameter that defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. However, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**Token Launches:**\nVerus also offers features for token launches, including the distribution of proceeds, pre-launch discounts for early participants, and vesting schedules in the pre-allocations using VerusIDs. This allows for flexible and customizable token launches that can meet the needs of different use cases.\n\nOverall, Verus provides a powerful and flexible platform for creating new blockchains, managing identities, and launching tokens. Its features enable a high degree of customization and control, making it an attractive option for developers and organizations looking to build on blockchain technology.\n\nDo you have any further questions about Verus, its features, or how they can be applied in different scenarios?",

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n## Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n## Conversion Q",
