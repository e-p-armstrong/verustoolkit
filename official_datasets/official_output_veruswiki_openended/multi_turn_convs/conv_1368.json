    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about Verus Vault, but I'm not entirely sure how it works. Can you explain how Verus Vault protects funds on a VerusID, and what benefits it provides in terms of security and decentralized funds recovery?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a powerful security feature that provides an additional layer of protection for your funds on a VerusID. I'd be happy to explain how it works and its benefits.\n\nVerus Vault is a security feature that allows you to protect funds on a VerusID, even in the event of private key theft. By locking your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. However, you can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards, and you can also still receive funds.\n\nTo use Verus Vault, you need to have at least one primary identity and one revocation/recovery ID configured. A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which can circumvent the lock. However, anyone with only the primary keys, including a multisig of primary keys, must first unlock the ID and then wait for a predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds.\n\nThis feature provides a high level of security and protection against common forms of crypto loss or theft, such as the \"5 dollar wrench attack\". It works like a bank, where you can set a delay on your locked IDs, for example, a 24-hour unlock delay, which provides a decentralized solution to this type of attack.\n\nIn addition to protecting funds, Verus Vault also provides security for IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This means that you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth, without relying on a traditional bank.\n\nVerus Vault provides several benefits, including:\n\n* Protection of funds on a VerusID, even in the event of private key theft\n* Ability to stake locked funds and earn rewards\n* Ability to receive funds while the ID is locked\n* Decentralized funds recovery through revocation and recovery authority identities\n* Security against common forms of crypto loss or theft\n* Time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance\n* Preservation of assets and generational blockchain wealth without relying on a traditional bank.\n\nDo you have any more questions about Verus Vault or its benefits?",

            "### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",
