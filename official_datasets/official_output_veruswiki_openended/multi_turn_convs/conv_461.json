    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the capabilities of Verus. Can you tell me how it enables the creation of new blockchains with features like crowdfunding, cross-chain fee conversions, and interoperability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus is designed to provide a powerful platform for creating new blockchains with a range of innovative features. Here's how it enables seamless connectivity, crowdfunding, and interoperability:\n\nVerus allows for blockchain-based **crowdfunding currency launches** with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge). This means that you can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of your blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations.\n\nAnother key feature is **cross-chain fee conversions**, where all fees generated via these conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This means that the new blockchain has full control over its own fees and liquidity pool.\n\nFinally, Verus enables the creation of an **interoperable multichain network**, where an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains can be created in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. These private blockchains are easy to set up with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n\nIn summary, Verus provides a powerful platform for creating new blockchains with features like crowdfunding, cross-chain fee conversions, and interoperability, enabling unlimited scale and new use cases.\n\nDo you have any more questions about how Verus enables the creation of new blockchains or these specific features?",
