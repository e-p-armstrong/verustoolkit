    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm still learning about the Verus platform. Can you explain the different types of locks that can be applied to an ID, and how they work? Additionally, I'd like to know how to query the available currencies for conversion on the Verus network.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help clarify the different types of locks and how to query available currencies for conversion.\n\nOn the Verus platform, there are two types of locks that can be applied to an ID: Time Lock and Time Delay.\n\n**Time Lock:**\nA Time Lock is a lock that specifies the unlock height of an identity. This means that an ID will remain locked until a certain block height is reached. To set a Time Lock, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter, like this:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Time Delay:**\nA Time Delay is a lock that delays the unlocking of an ID by a certain number of blocks when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. This means that even when an ID's flags are set to unlock, it will remain locked for a specified number of blocks. To set a Time Delay, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter, like this:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Revoking an Identity:**\nIt's important to note that revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of any Time Lock or Time Delay that may be set.\n\nRegarding your second question, to query the available currencies for conversion on the Verus network, you can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API. This API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example, to find all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return a list of currencies that meet the specified criteria.\n\nDo you have any more questions about locks or querying available currencies for conversion?",
