    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still learning about the Verus ecosystem, and I was wondering about the distribution of Verus coins when creating an identity. Can you explain how that works, and what's the incentive structure for referrers and miners/stakers in the Verus ecosystem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to explain how Verus coin distribution works when creating an identity, and the incentive structure behind it.\n\nWhen creating an identity on the Verus network, a certain amount of Verus coins (VRSC) are distributed to various parties involved in the process. This distribution serves as an incentive structure to encourage participation and validation of identities on the network.\n\nHere's how the distribution works:\n\n* 20 VRSC are awarded to the referrer's ID, which is the identity that referred the new identity creation.\n* 20 VRSC are awarded to the referrer's referrer's ID, which is the identity that referred the referrer.\n* 20 VRSC are awarded to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID, which is the identity that referred the referrer's referrer.\n* 20 VRSC are awarded to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined. This miner is responsible for validating and adding the new identity to the blockchain.\n\nThe remaining funds, which are not paid out to referrers, go directly to the miners or stakers of the blockchain. This means that 100% of the funds not allocated to referrers are distributed to the parties responsible for securing and validating the network.\n\nThis incentive structure is designed to encourage users to participate in the Verus ecosystem, both by creating new identities and by referring others to do so. It also rewards the miners and stakers who provide the necessary computational power and validation to secure the network.\n\nDo you have any more questions about how Verus coin distribution works, or the incentives behind it?",
