    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I just downloaded the Verus software, but I want to make sure it's authentic and hasn't been tampered with. How do I verify the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads? And what should I know about potential false positives from antivirus software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerifying the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads is a crucial step to ensure you're using genuine software from the Verus Coin Foundation. Let me walk you through the process.\n\n**Verifying Downloads:**\nEach download package comes with a `.txt` file that contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". To verify the download, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Extract the downloaded archive**: Unzip or untar the downloaded file.\n2. **Verify the signature for the extracted archive**: Use the extracted text file to verify the signature.\n3. **Extract the archive to the desired directory**: Once the signature has been verified, you can extract the archive to the directory of your choice.\n\n**CLI Examples:**\nYou can use the `verus` command-line tool to verify the file directly or using a checksum.\n\n**Verifying a file directly:**\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <file_path>\n```\n**Verifying using a checksum:**\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <checksum>\n```\nNow, about those antivirus software false positives...\n\n**Antivirus Software False Positives:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software includes mining capabilities, which can be exploited by third parties to use your computer for mining without your consent. However, these warnings are false positives, and you can safely ignore them.\n\nFor more information about these false positives, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n* https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-bitcoinminer/\n* https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/not-a-virus/18015/\n\nDo you have any more questions about verifying Verus downloads or those antivirus software warnings?",
