    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm curious about the Verus DeFi protocol and how it addresses some common issues in DeFi. Specifically, how does it address issues related to miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, and what features does it offer for launching new blockchains and liquidity pools?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus DeFi protocol has some innovative solutions to address the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. \n\nTo tackle MEV and front-running, the Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This is achieved through the integration of DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols, which provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities.\n\nBut that's not all! The Verus DeFi protocol also offers several features for launching new blockchains and liquidity pools. One of the key features is the ability to launch a new blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This bridge converter liquidity pool runs on the new blockchain and earns fees via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This provides seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and the Verus ecosystem.\n\nAnother feature offered by the Verus DeFi protocol is the ability to launch blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds. This allows users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on chain. If the minimum levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and price-neutral carve-outs, giving users a high degree of flexibility and control over their launches.\n\nOverall, the Verus DeFi protocol provides a robust and flexible platform for launching new blockchains and liquidity pools, while addressing the issues of MEV and front-running, and offering a range of features to support successful launches.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the Verus DeFi protocol, or would you like to know more about its features and capabilities?",

Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-out",
