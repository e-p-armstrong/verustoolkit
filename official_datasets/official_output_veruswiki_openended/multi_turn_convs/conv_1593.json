    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with Verus and I'm trying to understand some of the commands. Can you explain the purpose of the `setidentitytimelock` command in Verus, and how it enables time-locking and unlocking of funds access for an on-chain VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `setidentitytimelock` command is a powerful tool in Verus that allows users to control access to their funds on a VerusID. \n\nThe `setidentitytimelock` command is used to enable time-locking and unlocking of funds access for an on-chain VerusID. This command allows users to set a time lock on their VerusID, which restricts access to their funds until a specified block height or after a certain number of blocks have passed.\n\nThe command has two main options: `unlockatblock` and `setunlockdelay`. The `unlockatblock` option allows users to set a specific block height at which the VerusID will be unlocked, or to unlock the ID immediately by passing the current block height. This option is absolute, meaning that the ID will automatically unlock when the specified block passes.\n\nThe `setunlockdelay` option, on the other hand, sets a time unlock delay on the VerusID. This means that once the ID has been unlocked, a specified number of blocks must pass before the ID will be able to spend funds on the blockchain. This delay starts counting down only when the ID is unlocked.\n\nIt's important to note that this time-locking feature only affects the VerusID on the specific blockchain it is set on, and does not affect the lock status of VerusIDs on other chains, even if they have the same identity. Additionally, services that support VerusID authentication and recognize this setting may also choose to prevent funds transfers when an ID is locked.\n\nIn summary, the `setidentitytimelock` command provides a way for users to control access to their funds on a VerusID, by setting time locks and unlock delays that must be respected before funds can be spent on the blockchain.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the `setidentitytimelock` command, or how it can be used in different scenarios?",

            "### `setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\":absoluteblockheight || \"setunlockdelay\":numberofblocksdelayafterunlock}' (returntx) (feeoffer) (sourceoffunds)`\nEnables timelocking and unlocking of funds access for an on-chain VerusID. This does not affect the lock status of VerusIDs on other chains,\nincluding VerusIDs with the same identity as this one, which has been exported to another chain.Use \"setunlockdelay\" to set a time unlock delay on an identity, which means that once the identity has been unlocked,\nnumberofblocksdelayafterunlock must then pass before the identity will be able to spend funds on this blockchain. Services\nwhich support VerusID authentication and recognize this setting may also choose to prevent funds transfers when an ID is locked.Use \"unlockatblock\" to either unlock, by passing the current block, which will still require waiting for the specified unlock\ndelay, or to set a future unlock height that immediately begins counting down. Unlike an unlock delay, which only starts counting\ndown when the ID is unlocked, an \"unlockatblock\" time lock is absolute and will automatically unlock when the specified\nblock passes.",
