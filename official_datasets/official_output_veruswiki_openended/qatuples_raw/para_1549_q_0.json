    "How do updates to an identity's address type affect the security of transactions sent to that identity, and what benefits does this bring to users?",
    "When an identity's address type is updated, all transactions sent to that identity will be subject to the new address type's spend conditions. This means that if an identity's address type is updated to a more secure type, such as a quantum secure address, all transactions sent to that identity will retroactively be secured under the control of that new address type.\n\nFor example, if an identity has 1000 transactions sent to it, and the address type is updated to a quantum secure address, all 1000 transactions will be secured under the control of that new address type. This provides a significant benefit to users, as it ensures that their transactions are protected from potential security threats, even if they were sent to an address type that is no longer considered secure.\n\nThis feature is particularly important in the context of quantum computing, as it allows users to future-proof their transactions and ensure that they remain secure even as quantum computing technology advances. By retroactively securing transactions under the control of a new address type, users can have confidence that their transactions are protected from potential quantum attacks, and that their assets are safe.",
    "ain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well. That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.",
