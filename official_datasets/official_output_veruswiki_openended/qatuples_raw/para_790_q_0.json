    "How does one initiate a currency launch on the Verus network, and what are the requirements and implications of doing so?",
    "To initiate a currency launch on the Verus network, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST and preconvert at least 1000 VRSCTEST to the new currency at a specified rate (in this case, 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD). This process is part of the mining process, and miners who participate in the launch by mining the blocks that launch the currency will earn a 0.025% conversion fee.\n\nBefore the block where the new currency (GOLD) launches, you can send a command to park your conversion until the token launches. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. Once the token launches, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nAfter the currency launches, you can create a new token (mycoin) that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. To do this, you would use a command similar to the one above, but with the necessary parameters for your new token.\n\nIt's worth noting that, currently, the only way to create new tokens is through a centralized issuance option. However, the Verus network provides a decentralized and secure way to launch and manage new currencies, with built-in mechanisms for conversion and mining.",
