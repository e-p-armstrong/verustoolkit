    "How can I retrieve the current price of VRSC in different currencies and exchanges using the VerusPay API?",
    "The VerusPay API provides a simple way to retrieve the current price of VRSC in various currencies and exchanges. By default, the API returns the average price of VRSC in USD fiat, weighted against 24-hour volume across all supported exchanges. However, you can customize the API request by adding various options to the URL.\n\nHere are the available options:\n\n* `currency`: Specify the currency in which you want to retrieve the price. You can use fiat codes like USD, CAD, or cryptocurrency codes like BTC.\n* `ticker`: Specify the ticker symbol of the cryptocurrency you want to retrieve the price for. Currently, only VRSC and ARRR are supported.\n* `data`: Specify the type of data you want to retrieve. You can choose between `volume` and `price`. If you choose `volume`, the API will return the 24-hour trading volume of VRSC on the specified exchange.\n* `exch`: Specify the name of the exchange you want to retrieve the price from. The API supports multiple exchanges, including DigitalPrice and CryptoBridge.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can customize the API request:\n\n* `https://veruspay.io/api/`: This is the default request, which returns the average price of VRSC in USD fiat.\n* `https://veruspay.io/api/?exch=digitalprice&currency=cad`: This request returns the current price of VRSC on DigitalPrice in CAD fiat.\n* `https://veruspay.io/api/?currency=btc`: This request returns the average price of VRSC in BTC, weighted by 24-hour volume across all supported exchanges.\n* `https://veruspay.io/api/?exch=cryptobridge&data=volume`: This request returns the 24-hour trading volume of VRSC on CryptoBridge in USD fiat.\n* `https://veruspay.io/api/?currency=cad&ticker=arrr`: This request returns the average price of ARRR in CAD fiat.\n\nBy using these options, you can customize the API request to retrieve the price of VRSC in different currencies and exchanges.",
