    "What is the process of updating the Verus bridge on testnet, and how can I recover if I miss the fork?",
    "When the Verus team updates the bridge on testnet, they provide instructions to ensure a smooth transition. In this case, the process involves shutting down the old version of Verus and restarting the notarizations and transaction flow between Ethereum and Verus at a specified time. \n\nTo update successfully, you need to:\n\n1. Shut down the old version of Verus.\n2. Wait for the specified time (in this case, 5 AM UTC).\n3. Restart Verus and let the notarizations and transaction flow between Ethereum and Verus resume.\n\nIf you miss the fork at the specified time, you can recover by:\n\n1. Stopping Verus.\n2. Deleting everything except your `wallet.dat` file in your data directory.\n\nThe data directory location varies depending on your operating system:\n\n* Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`\n* Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest`\n\nBy following these steps, you can recover from missing the fork and get back on the correct chain. Additionally, the Verus team reminds us that IDs can be exported to a PBaaS chain using the `sendcurrency` command, as shown in the example:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\n\nThis command exports an ID to a PBaaS chain, allowing for the transfer of IDs between chains.",
    "The good news is that throughout the whole process of this first bridge release on testnet, we've been able to update through the issues we've seen without a reset and have not lost a single satoshi of test funds (which is not to say it is fully hardened quite yet). At this point, we hope and believe that this is the last update in this round of testnet, which will allow us to get back to focusing on the mainnet release and not asking those testing to update until we are very close to a mainnet release.Once more, we will ask that you shut down the old version now, and we will restart the notarizations and transaction flow between Ethereum and Verus at 5 AM UTC time.Thank you to everyone who helped with all the testing and exposing of issues that enabled us to make maybe even inconveniently quick progress.If you miss the fork for this version at the above time you can get back on the correct chain by stopping Verus and deleting deleting everything other than your wallet.dat file in your data directory at:\n- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest`## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n  ```",
