    "How do I verify the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads, and what should I do about false positive virus warnings from some antivirus software?",
    "Verifying the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads is an important step to ensure that you are installing genuine software. To do this, you can use the `verus` command-line tool to verify the digital signature of the downloaded file.\n\nEach Verus download package comes with a `.txt` file that contains the signer's identity, a standard SHA-256 file checksum, and a signature. The signer's identity is \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". You can use this information to verify the signature of the downloaded file.\n\nHere are the steps to verify the download:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature of the extracted archive using the extracted `.txt` file. You can do this using the `verus verifyfile` command, followed by the signer's identity, the signature, and the path to the extracted file.\n\nFor example:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AeduGgABQSCt7p7H5gtjUkrIAAk5SX9ss9xXz5Z+Qikf61vRPnWGSyX6tLaO62BMNTKDE7sJVA9/Bp89yR1fZZ6h04ARIyYT /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.8.0-1-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.8.0-1-x86_64.tar.gz\n```\nAlternatively, you can verify the download using a checksum. You can do this using the `verus verifyhash` command, followed by the signer's identity, the signature, and the checksum.\n\nFor example:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AeduGgABQSCt7p7H5gtjUkrIAAk5SX9ss9xXz5Z+Qikf61vRPnWGSyX6tLaO62BMNTKDE7sJVA9/Bp89yR1fZZ6h04ARIyYT 998170ee70cca3116bc100ef1b972fd919a39b069ebd1dd5a6e1df30f9abacc1\n```\nRegarding false positive virus warnings, some antivirus software may flag Verus downloads as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because Verus is a mining software, and some antivirus software may warn users about installing mining software that could be used to exploit their PCs.\n\nHowever, these warnings are false positives, and Verus is a legitimate software. You can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives.\n\nOnce you have verified the authenticity and integrity of the download, you can extract the archive to the desired directory and install Verus.",
