    "How does the `sendcurrency` API work in Verus, and what are some examples of its usage?",
    "The `sendcurrency` API in Verus is used to send and convert funds within the Verus ecosystem. This API is a powerful tool that allows users to manage their funds, convert between different currencies, and send funds to other users.\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API can be used to send funds from one address to another. You can specify the sender's address, the recipient's address, the currency to be sent, and the amount to be sent. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@), you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients using friendly-name z-addresses. For example:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Converting Funds:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API also allows you to convert funds from one currency to another. You can convert funds using IDs as a funding source, or through a fractional currency. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC, using IDs as a funding source, you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC, through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC. For example:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\"}]'\n```\nNote that all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset, so be sure to only use this API for testing purposes.",
