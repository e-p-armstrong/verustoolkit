    "What is the process for generating and importing a Wallet Import Format (WIF) for a public address in Verus, and how should I handle the resulting sensitive information?",
    "To generate and import a WIF for a public address in Verus, you will need to follow a few steps. \n\n**Step 1: Generate the WIF**\nFirst, you will need to use the `convertpassphrase` command in the Verus CLI to generate a WIF. This command will produce a response that includes the WIF, which is a 52-character string. This response will also include other sensitive information, such as the wallet passphrase, address, public key, and private key. It is extremely important to store this information in a safe and secure location, as it grants full control over the associated address.\n\n**Step 2: Import the WIF**\nNext, you will need to import the WIF into your Verus wallet. To do this, go to the `settings` --> `Coin Settings` menu, select the desired chain, and enter the following command:\n```\nrun importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" true\n```\nReplace `<wif>` with the actual WIF generated in Step 1. Note that this process may take some time to complete, especially if the address has a large number of transactions associated with it. Additionally, the GUI wallet may not display any progress or may display error messages, but the import process should continue to run in the background.\n\n**Important Security Note**\nIt is crucial to handle the generated WIF and other sensitive information with care. Make sure to store it in a secure location, such as a password-protected file or a secure note-taking app. Never share this information with anyone, and avoid storing it in an unsecured location, such as an unencrypted file or an insecure online service.",
    "You will receive a response __similar__ to this:\n```\n{\n\"walletpassphrase\": \"seedphrase\",\n\"address\": \"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\",\n\"pubkey\": \"02ffc2f4b071afdec631e3fb7d435a0047be14a81ea1a269e4206b0068c0c1fa6f\",\n\"privkey\": \"d899ed88e9ee2e90c2cf51cb47e7b4495ec1e1cb10763bb1c111b0bde48bf86c\",\n\"wif\": \"UwGb5KvGPfMUr1tu74Desjh87ZeJM4wq5goLyThcogeLifc5aJqT\"\n}\n```\nCopy that information and store it somewhere **SAFE**. With this information anyone having access to it will have full control over that address.The 52-character string after **\"wif\":** that is shown, is what you want to import in the next step.## Importing a single WIF for a public (transparent) address\nTo import your address, go to `settings` --> `Coin Settings`, select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner and enter the following command:\n```\nrun importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" true\n```\nReplace `<wif>` with the actual **wif** you got from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier.Note: Don't use the WIF from the example above, but use the one from the CLI-interface in Verus Desktop.Note: The GUI wallet will not show any progress on the import and may give messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting. It will take quite some time for the process to finish in the background, especially if the address has many transaction on it.",
