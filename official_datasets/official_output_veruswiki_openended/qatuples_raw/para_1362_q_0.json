    "What are Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault, and how do they contribute to the security and functionality of the Verus blockchain?",
    "Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault are two innovative features of the Verus blockchain that aim to enhance its security, sustainability, and functionality.\n\n**Verus Fee Pooling Technology:**\nVerus Fee Pooling technology is a novel approach to mining and staking fees that addresses the concerns raised by Vitalik Buterin about Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0. In this model, all fees from transactions in a block are collected and added to a common, persistent pool of fees. The current block miner or staker then takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool. This approach preserves the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time. This design ensures a sustainable mining and staking economy while maintaining the security of the blockchain.\n\n**Verus Vault:**\nVerus Vault is an advanced time-locking capability for identities that provides a theft-resistant workflow for identity management. It enables various use cases, including trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, estate planning, and more. The concept is simple yet powerful, and when combined with the revocation and recovery capabilities of VerusID, the possibilities are immense. Verus Vault allows for advanced control over identity management, enabling users to create complex workflows and scenarios that were previously not possible.\n\nIn summary, Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault are two groundbreaking features of the Verus blockchain that enhance its security, sustainability, and functionality. They provide a robust and flexible framework for mining, staking, and identity management, setting Verus apart from other blockchain platforms.",
    "- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
