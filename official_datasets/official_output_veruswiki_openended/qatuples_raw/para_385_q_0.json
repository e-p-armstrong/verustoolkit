    "What are the features and benefits of launching a new blockchain and bridge converter liquidity pool on the Verus network, and how can they be configured for crowdfunding and interoperability?",
    "Launching a new blockchain and bridge converter liquidity pool on the Verus network offers several features and benefits. \n\n**Simultaneous Launch of Blockchain and Bridge Converter Liquidity Pool:**\nWhen launching a new blockchain, a fully decentralized or centralized bridge converter liquidity pool can be launched simultaneously. This bridge converter liquidity pool operates on the new blockchain, and all fees generated from cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This provides seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and other chains in the Verus network.\n\n**Blockchain-based Crowdfunding Currency Launches:**\nThe Verus network allows for blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds. This means that creators can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations.\n\n**Interoperable, Multichain Network:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking. This allows for unlimited scale and new use cases, making it possible to create a vast network of interconnected blockchains that can interact with each other seamlessly.\n\nIn summary, the Verus network provides a powerful platform for launching new blockchains and bridge converter liquidity pools, with features like crowdfunding, interoperability, and unlimited scale.",

Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as",
