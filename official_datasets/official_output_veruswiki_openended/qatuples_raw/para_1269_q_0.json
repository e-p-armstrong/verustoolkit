    "How do I launch a new token, such as GOLD, on the Verus network, and what are the requirements for doing so? Additionally, how can I create a new token, like mycoin, that can be converted from GOLD or VRSCTEST?",
    "To launch a new token, such as GOLD, on the Verus network, you need to fund a currency launch transaction with at least 10 VRSCTEST. This transaction will initiate a currency launch that will start 50 blocks from when it was made (by default). The launch requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD.\n\nHere's how it works: when you send the transaction to launch the GOLD token, it will be mined into a block, and the mining process will earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD.\n\nBefore the GOLD token launches, you can park your conversion by sending a command like:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.\n\nOnce the GOLD token has launched, you can create a new token, like mycoin, that can be converted from GOLD or VRSCTEST. To do this, you can define the properties of mycoin using a command like:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\" with specific properties, such as the currencies it can be converted from, the minimum amounts required for conversion, and its initial supply.",
    "ncy must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
