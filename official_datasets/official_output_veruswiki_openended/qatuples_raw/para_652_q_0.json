    "How do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, tokenize ID control for next-generation NFTs, and create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent in Verus?",
    "In Verus, you can perform several advanced operations related to multi-signature IDs, tokenization, and identity creation. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve these tasks:\n\n**Signing Transactions from Multi-Signature IDs:**\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a transaction**: Use the `verus sendcurrency` command to create a transaction from your multi-signature ID. For example:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\nThis command will return an operation ID.\n\n2. **Get the raw transaction data**: Use the `verus z_getoperationstatus` command to retrieve the raw hex transaction data. For example:\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\nThis command will provide you with the raw hex transaction data.\n\n3. **Sign the transaction**: Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs. Use the `verus signrawtransaction` command to sign the transaction. For example:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\nRepeat this step for each additional signature required.\n\n4. **Broadcast the signed transaction**: After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using the `verus sendrawtransaction` command. For example:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\n\n**Tokenizing ID Control (Next-Generation NFT):**\nTo tokenize ID control for next-generation NFTs, you can define a currency with specific flags and settings. Here's an example:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```\nIn this example, the currency definition includes the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN` flags, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre-allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n\n**Creating an Identity with a Fractional Currency as its Parent:**\nTo create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent, you can use the `registernamecommitment` command with additional positional arguments. For example:\n```\nregisternamecommitment <name> <currency_parent> <funding_address>\n```\nUse quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank. For example, the following command specifies a parent currency, `vrsc-btc`, but no referrer:\n```\nregisternamecommitment <name> \"vrsc-btc\" <funding_address>\n```\nYou can now use `z_addresses` to fund the name commitment and identity registration.",

Use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration",
