    "What are the key points I should know about using this experimental software, and how do I define a test chain using the `definechain` command?",
    "Before using this software, it's essential to understand that it's experimental, unfinished, and comes with no warranty. You use it at your own risk, and the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any damage or claims arising from its use. Additionally, this software is intended for testing purposes only and should not be used as a main wallet.\n\nTo define a test chain, you can use the `definechain` command. The basic syntax for this command is:\n```\n./komodo-cli -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ <chain_definition> }'\n```\nWhere `<chain_definition>` is a JSON object that specifies the properties of the chain. Here's an example of a sample chain definition:\n```\n./komodo-cli -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [{\"reward\" : 10000000000}], \"notarizationreward\" : 1440000000, \"billingperiod\" : 1440, \"nodes\" : [{\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2500\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"\"}, {\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2501\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"RDyDzC5JB66Y29fzBkamywqEn1PJXTzj8B\"}]}'\n```\nIn this example, the chain is named \"SOMECOIN\", and it has one era with a reward of 10 billion. The notarization reward is set to 1.44 billion, and the billing period is 1440 blocks. The chain has two nodes, each with its own node address and payment address.\n\nSome important notes about defining a chain:\n\n* You can have a maximum of 3 eras.\n* You need a minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations.\n* The minimum notarization reward is 0.01 VRSCTEST per block.\n* You need to have VRSCTEST in your wallet to create a chain, although they are not paid out yet.\n\nRemember to use this software at your own risk and only for testing purposes.",
