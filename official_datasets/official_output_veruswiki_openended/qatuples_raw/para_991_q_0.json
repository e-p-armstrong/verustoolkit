    "What are some key features of the Verus multichain protocol, specifically in regards to launching new blockchains and cross-chain interactions?",
    "The Verus multichain protocol offers several key features that enable the creation and interaction of multiple blockchains within its network. Here are some of the key features:\n\n**Blockchain Launches with Minimum Participation or Automatic Refunds:**\nVerus allows for crowdfunding-style currency launches with minimum participation requirements. If the minimum participation levels are not met by the launch time, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees. Additionally, launch options can include maximum participation limits, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and vesting schedules.\n\n**Interoperable Multichain Network:**\nThe Verus network enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, each with its own decentralized bridge confirmation provided by Notary IDs specified at chain definition. This allows for public blockchains to be merge-mined and staked, as well as private, internal blockchains that can be easily set up and bridged with public currencies. The Verus network has no limit on the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate simultaneously, with some overhead for cross-notarization.\n\n**Seamless Cross-Chain Interactions:**\nVerus enables seamless connectivity between blockchains, with all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool earned on the new blockchain, without any rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This allows for unlimited scale and new use cases to emerge from the interactions between different blockchains within the Verus network.\n\nOverall, the Verus multichain protocol provides a robust and flexible framework for launching and interacting with multiple blockchains, enabling new use cases and unlimited scale.",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.
