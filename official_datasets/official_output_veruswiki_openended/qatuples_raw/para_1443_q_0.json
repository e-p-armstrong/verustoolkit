    "How do I launch a trusted, auditable currency (e.g., gold@) that maps to a specific store of gold, and create a token (e.g., mycoin@) that offers utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level, using Verus?",
    "To launch a trusted, auditable currency like gold@ that maps to a specific store of gold, and create a token like mycoin@ that offers utility or product value, you can use Verus's command-line interface to define and launch these currencies. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n**Launching gold@:**\nTo launch gold@, you need to define it using the `definecurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency called gold@ with specific properties, such as conversion rates and pre-allocation of funds. To initiate the currency launch, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST and send the transaction returned by this command. The launch will start 50 blocks from when it was made, and it will require 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD to launch.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to GOLD:**\nAfter gold@ launches, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, and then you will either receive 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\n**Launching mycoin@:**\nTo launch mycoin@, which is similar to a Kickstarter, you can define it using a similar process to gold@. However, the specifics of the definition will depend on the utility or product value offered by mycoin@. For example, you may want to define a conversion rate or a minimum purchase level to unlock the utility or product value.\n\nIn general, Verus's command-line interface provides a flexible way to define and launch new currencies with specific properties and use cases. By using Verus, you can create trusted, auditable currencies that map to specific assets or offer utility or product value.",
    " only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin",
