    "What are the limitations and considerations when defining a multi-currency PBaaS chain using the `definecurrency` command in Verus, and how can I properly define a PBaaS chain?",
    "When defining a multi-currency PBaaS chain using the `definecurrency` command in Verus, there are some limitations and considerations to be aware of.\n\n**Defining a PBaaS Chain:**\nTo define a PBaaS chain, you need to pass two JSON objects to the `definecurrency` command. The first JSON object defines the properties of the PBaaS chain, such as its name, options, currencies, conversions, eras, notaries, minimum notaries required to confirm a block, nodes, gateway converter name, and gateway converter issuance. The second JSON object defines the overridable defaults for the bridge, including the currencies supported, initial contributions, and initial supply.\n\nHere is an example of how to define a PBaaS chain:\n```json\n./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"options\":330,\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\"],\"conversions\":[1],\"eras\":[{\"reward\":1200000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0}],\"notaries\":[\"Notary1@\",\"Notary2@\",\"Notary3@\"],\"minnotariesconfirm\":2,\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.111:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node1@\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.112:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node2@\"}],\"gatewayconvertername\":\"Bridge\",\"gatewayconverterissuance\":1000000}' '{\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\",\"PBaaSChain\",\"USD\"],\"initialcontributions\":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],\"initialsupply\":3000000}'\n```\n\n**Limitations:**\nThere are two main limitations to be aware of when defining a multi-currency PBaaS chain:\n\n1. ** IDs with i-addresses as names:** You should not create an ID with an i-address as its actual name, as this can cause problems when referring to the currency or identity. Instead, use a name that is not an i-address.\n2. **Currency name conflicts:** In the GUI version of Verus, you cannot use the same name as an existing currency, such as BTC or ETH, for your PBaaS chain. This limitation will be removed before mainnet availability.\n\nBy understanding these limitations and considerations, you can properly define a PBaaS chain using the `definecurrency` command in Verus.",
    "Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`\n```json\n./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"options\":330,\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\"],\"conversions\":[1],\"eras\":[{\"reward\":1200000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0}],\"notaries\":[\"Notary1@\",\"Notary2@\",\"Notary3@\"],\"minnotariesconfirm\":2,\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.111:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node1@\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.112:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node2@\"}],\"gatewayconvertername\":\"Bridge\",\"gatewayconverterissuance\":1000000}' '{\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\",\"PBaaSChain\",\"USD\"],\"initialcontributions\":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],\"initialsupply\":3000000}'\n```## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.",
