    "How do VerusIDs ensure the security of transactions, especially in the context of quantum computing, and what benefits do they provide in terms of retroactive security?",
    "VerusIDs offer a high level of security for transactions, including those that may be vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. One of the key features of VerusIDs is that they can be upgraded to quantum secure addresses when they become available. This means that if you have a large number of transactions sent to your identity name/address, you can retroactively secure all of those transactions by upgrading to a quantum secure address.\n\nThis is possible because VerusIDs are designed to be forward-thinking and adaptable to new security technologies. When quantum secure addresses become available, VerusID holders can upgrade their addresses to take advantage of the enhanced security features. This upgrade process is retroactive, meaning that it will apply to all previous transactions sent to the original address, not just new ones.\n\nIn other words, if you have 1000 transactions sent to your original VerusID, and you upgrade to a quantum secure address, all 1000 of those transactions will be retroactively secured under the control of the new address. This provides an additional layer of security and protection for users, ensuring that their transactions are safe from potential quantum computing threats.\n\nOverall, VerusIDs offer a robust and flexible security solution that is designed to evolve with emerging technologies, providing users with a high level of confidence and protection for their transactions.",
