    "What is Verus Vault, and how does it enhance the security and protection of funds on a VerusID, even from private key theft?",
    "Verus Vault is a security feature that provides an additional layer of protection for funds stored on a VerusID. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, it becomes impossible to spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked. However, it's still possible to stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards, and receive new funds.\n\nTo enable Verus Vault, you need to have at least one primary identity and one revocation/recovery ID configured. A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which bypasses the lock. However, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys, must first unlock the identity and wait for a predetermined unlock time before they can access or spend the funds.\n\nThis feature provides a decentralized solution to the \"5-dollar wrench attack\" by allowing you to set a delay, such as 24 hours, on your locked IDs. During this time, if an unauthorized unlock occurs, the revocation ID can be used to revoke and recover the funds.\n\nVerus Vault not only protects funds but also provides security for IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other purposes like vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This means you can now safeguard your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, without relying on a bank.",
    "#### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",
