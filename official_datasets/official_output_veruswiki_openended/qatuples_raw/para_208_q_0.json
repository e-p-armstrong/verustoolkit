    "What information can I retrieve about the Verus network using the `getnettotals` and `getnetworkinfo` commands, and how can I use them?",
    "The `getnettotals` and `getnetworkinfo` commands are two important tools for retrieving information about the Verus network. \n\n**`getnettotals` Command:**\nThe `getnettotals` command returns a JSON object containing three key pieces of information about the Verus network:\n\n1. `totalbytesrecv`: This is a numeric value representing the total number of bytes received by the network.\n2. `totalbytessent`: This is a numeric value representing the total number of bytes sent by the network.\n3. `timemillis`: This is a numeric value representing the total CPU time in milliseconds.\n\nYou can use the `getnettotals` command in the Verus command-line interface or through a JSON-RPC request using `curl`. For example, you can use the following command in the Verus command-line interface:\n```\nverus getnettotals\n```\nOr, you can use the following `curl` command to make a JSON-RPC request:\n```bash\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getnettotals\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n**`getnetworkinfo` Command:**\nThe `getnetworkinfo` command returns an object containing various state information regarding P2P networking. This command provides a broader range of information about the network, including its current state, connectivity, and other relevant details.\n\nBy using these two commands, you can gain valuable insights into the performance and state of the Verus network, which can be useful for troubleshooting, monitoring, and optimizing your Verus experience.",
    "#### Result:\n```json\n{\n \"totalbytesrecv\": n,  (numeric) Total bytes received\n \"totalbytessent\": n,  (numeric) Total bytes sent\n \"timemillis\": t    (numeric) Total cpu time\n}\n```\nExamples:\n```bash\n> verus getnettotals\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getnettotals\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```### `getnetworkinfo`\nReturns an object containing various state info regarding P2P networking.",
