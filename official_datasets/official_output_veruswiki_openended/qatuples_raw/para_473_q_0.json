    "How do I create a new currency in Verus, and what are the steps involved in defining and launching it?",
    "To create a new currency in Verus, you need to follow a series of steps. Let's go through them in detail.\n\n**Defining the Currency:**\nFirst, you need to define the currency using the `definecurrency` command. This command takes a JSON object as an argument, which specifies the properties of the currency. For example, to define a currency called \"gold\", you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a currency called \"gold\" with specific properties, such as the conversion rate to VRSCTEST, the minimum amount required for conversion, and the pre-allocation of coins to a specific address.\n\n**Funding the Currency Identity:**\nBefore launching the currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. This is a requirement for launching the currency.\n\n**Launching the Currency:**\nTo launch the currency, you need to send a transaction to the network with the definition of the currency. This transaction will be mined into a block, and the currency will launch 50 blocks later (by default). The launch process requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be pre-converted to GOLD at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD. The mining process earns a 0.025% conversion fee for participating in the launch.\n\n**Converting to the New Currency:**\nAfter the currency launches, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command parks the conversion until the token launches, and then you will either receive 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\n**Creating a New Currency with Multiple Conversion Options:**\nIf you want to create a new currency that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can define it using the `definecurrency` command again. For example, to create a currency called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you would use a command similar to the one used to define the \"gold\" currency.\n\nOverall, creating a new currency in Verus involves defining the currency, funding its identity, launching it, and then converting to it using the `sendcurrency` command.",
    "s, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
