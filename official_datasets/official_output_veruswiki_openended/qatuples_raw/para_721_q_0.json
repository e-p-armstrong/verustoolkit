    "How does Verus Vault provide decentralized protection and recovery for funds, IDs, and NFTs, and what are some of its key features and use cases?",
    "Verus Vault is a solution that provides decentralized protection and recovery for funds, IDs, and NFTs. It achieves this through a combination of locked VerusIDs, revocation and recovery authorities, and time locks. Here's how it works:\n\nWhen a VerusID is locked, it can only be accessed or spent after a predetermined unlock time has passed. However, the revocation and recovery authority identities can circumvent this lock and revoke or recover the ID at any time. This means that you can assign a trusted party, such as a company that specializes in blockchain monitoring, to watch for unauthorized unlock attempts and take action to revoke and recover your ID if necessary.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Verus Vault is that it provides protection against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\", where an attacker uses physical force to gain access to a user's private keys. By setting a delay between unlocking and accessing funds, Verus Vault gives the revocation and recovery authorities time to detect and respond to unauthorized unlock attempts.\n\nIn addition to protecting funds, Verus Vault also provides security for IDs and NFTs. It can be used to implement time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This means that you can use Verus Vault to create complex, decentralized financial arrangements that are secure and resistant to loss or theft.\n\nOverall, Verus Vault provides a decentralized solution for protecting and recovering blockchain assets, without the need for a central authority or bank. It offers a new level of security and flexibility for users, and has a wide range of potential use cases.",
    "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
