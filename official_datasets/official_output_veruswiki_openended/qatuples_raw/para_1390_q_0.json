    "How does Verus handle fees for conversions, and what features does it offer for launching new currencies?",
    "Verus has a fee structure in place for conversions, which is set at 0.025%. This fee is distributed entirely to miners and stakers, incentivizing them to participate in the network. Additionally, Verus plans to implement an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions. This fee will be higher for blocks that significantly change the price of a currency, and lower for blocks with less volatility. This mechanism ensures that liquidity providers are compensated for taking on the risk of impermanent loss.\n\nWhen it comes to launching new currencies, Verus offers a range of features to make the process easy and flexible. Currency launches can be set up with Kickstarter-like minimums, which means that if the minimum participation threshold is not met, the launch will be automatically refunded. The launch process also includes dynamic pricing based on participation, with pre-launch discounts available for early participants. Furthermore, Verus allows for pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, making it possible to customize the launch process to suit different needs.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Verus is its import/export protocol, which makes it easy to integrate with other blockchains. This enables the seamless transfer of tokens between Verus and other networks, such as Ethereum and ERC20 tokens. In fact, external bridges are already being developed to allow for automatic sending and receiving of Verus network tokens between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens. This means that currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, and will be automatically exposed on ETH as an ERC20 token.\n\nOverall, Verus offers a robust and flexible platform for launching and managing new currencies, with features that cater to a range of use cases and requirements.",
    "There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.# The Best Way to Launch a Currency\nCurrency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!Currencies can be launched to accept a range of other currencies and with or without fractional reserve capabilities. Verus import/export protocol was designed to make integration with other block chains provable and easy, and there are already external bridges in progress that expect to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens, where currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network, and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.",
