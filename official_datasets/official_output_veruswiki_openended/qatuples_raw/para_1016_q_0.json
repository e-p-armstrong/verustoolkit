    "What are some limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency features in Verus, and how do I reset the testnet environment after an update?",
    "When using the multi-currency features in Verus, there are a few limitations to be aware of:\n\n**Limitation 1:**\nIn both the GUI and CLI, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because an i-address will always be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. To avoid potential user confusion, it's generally advised to avoid creating IDs with i-addresses as their names. Additionally, the set of characters that are not allowed for currency registrations will be expanded to prevent such scenarios.\n\n**Limitation 2 (GUI only):**\nIf a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you cannot use the same name for a PBaaS chain. However, this limitation will be removed before mainnet availability.\n\n**Testnet Reset:**\nIf you have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current update, you will need to delete certain directories before running the new update. The directories to delete vary depending on your operating system:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nDeleting these directories will allow you to reset the testnet environment and ensure a smooth transition to the new update.",
    "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/vrsctest\n```**MacOS**\n```\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest\n```**Windows**\n```\n\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST\n```# Disclaimer",
