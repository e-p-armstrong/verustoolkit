    "How do I create a currency in Verus, and what are the requirements and implications of doing so?",
    "In Verus, creating a currency requires having an ID with the same name as the currency you want to create. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. This means that if you want to create a currency called \"gold@\", you need to have an ID named \"gold@\" and be its controller.\n\nWhen you create a currency, you have full control over its properties and behavior. For example, you can decide how it is backed, how it is transferred, and how it is used. In the case of the \"gold@\" currency, you may want to map it to a specific, auditable store of gold, which would give the currency a tangible value and make it more trustworthy.\n\nAnother example could be creating a currency called \"mycoin@\", which could be used for a specific purpose, such as a Kickstarter-like project. In this case, the creator of the currency would need to have an ID named \"mycoin@\" and would have control over how the currency is used and distributed.\n\nIt's important to note that creating a currency in Verus is a powerful action, and it should be done with careful consideration and planning. The creator of the currency has a lot of responsibility, as they will be in control of the currency's properties and behavior, and will need to ensure that it is used in a way that is trustworthy and transparent.\n\nIn general, creating a currency in Verus requires a deep understanding of the platform and its capabilities, as well as a clear vision for how the currency will be used and managed. It's not a decision that should be taken lightly, but with the right approach, it can be a powerful tool for creating new economic opportunities and systems.",

The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business,",
