    "What should I do if I encounter the error \"Cannot Get a lock on data directory\" when trying to start Verus, and how can I determine if Verus is already running?",
    "If you encounter the error \"Cannot Get a lock on data directory /root/.komodo/VRSC\" when trying to start Verus, it likely means that Verus is already running. This error message is indicating that Verus cannot access the data directory because it is already in use by another instance of Verus.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to determine if Verus is indeed already running. You can do this by running the command `./verus getinfo`. If Verus is running, this command will return information about the current state of Verus. If Verus is not running, this command will throw an error.\n\nIf the `getinfo` command throws an error, you can further investigate by running the command `ps fax | grep verus`. This command will show you a list of currently running processes, and you should see `verusd` listed as a process, along with its child process `komodo` and any command-line arguments that were used to start it.\n\nBy following these steps, you can determine if Verus is already running and take the necessary steps to resolve the issue and successfully start Verus.",
    "# ERROR: Cannot Get a lock on data directory /root/.komodo/VRSC.\n\nKomodo is probably already running.\n\n## Procedure:\n\nIt just means you can't start it when it's already running. If it isn't running we can take a look at it.\nCheck to see if it is running by running:\n\n`./verus getinfo`\n\nIf it's running you'll get info back, if it isn't you'll get an error.\nIf that throws an error, it's worth checking using this command:\n\n`ps fax | grep verus`\n\nand seeing if any processes are listed besides the process you're using to search.\nYou would see verusd with a child process of komodo and all its cli arguments.\n\n(submitted by @keda666, solution written by englal.vrsc@)\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-02-26.",
