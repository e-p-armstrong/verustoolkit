    "How does Verus ensure the security and decentralization of its cross-chain protocol, and what benefits does this bring to the network?",
    "Verus has implemented a robust cross-chain protocol that ensures the security and decentralization of its network. This protocol is designed to prevent censorship and ensure that all notarizations are ultimately determined by miners and stakers.\n\nOne of the key features of this protocol is the ability for users to revoke their identity, which prevents a notarization from being confirmed. This feature is supported across all PBaaS chains and has also been implemented in Ethereum contracts for witnesses. Additionally, the protocol allows for other types of evidence to prevent finalization, such as proof of a more powerful tip than one witnessed.\n\nTo achieve this, the protocol requires changes to generalize evidence types between chains, enabling cryptographic enforcement of the rules. This means that witnesses cannot finalize a chain tip unless alternating miners and stakers have posted three consecutive, agreeing, progressing cross-chain notarizations without intervening disagreement.\n\nThis approach provides several benefits, including maximum decentralization, a high cost to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, and incentivized merge mining and bridge mining opportunities. It also makes miner/staker participation critical to the cross-chain protocol.\n\nIn practice, this means that all PBaaS chains on the testnet will consider witnessed/finalized tips as final and will not unwind past those witness points or follow a chain that disagrees with a known finalized tip. This ensures that the network is secure, decentralized, and resistant to censorship.\n\nOverall, Verus's cross-chain protocol provides a robust and secure framework for decentralized applications, enabling the creation of a trusted and censorship-resistant network.",
    "y revoke their identity, which will prevent that notarization from ever being confirmed. This same security feature is supported between all PBaaS chains and has been implemented in the Ethereum contracts for witnesses as well. This new protocol also provides for other types of evidence to prevent finalization, such as proof that there exists a more powerful (most power rule) tip than one witnessed. Enabling decentralized, cross-chain most power rules are an advance in cross-chain protocols that over time will strongly protect censorship resistance qualities of any multichain protocol.\n - The above technology required changes to generalize evidence types between chains, enabling cryptographic enforcement that all notarizations are ultimately determined by miners and stakers and finalized by witnesses who must follow most power (stake+work) rules based on the protocol. Witnesses cannot finalize a chain tip unless alternating miners and stakers have posted 3 consecutive, agreeing, progressing cross-chain notarizations, without intervening disagreement, trading off more certain cross-chain transaction latency for on that depends on miners and stakers, meaning maximum decentralization and a high cost to DoS attack cross-chain, approaching impossible over any significant length of time. This approach makes the incentivized merge mining and bridge mining opportunities, as well as miner/staker participation, automatically part of and also critical to the cross-chain protocol. In v0.9.4, all users on the network may mine the Ethereum bridge via the bridgekeeper tool on the mining page in the GUI.\n - With this new protocol, all PBaaS chains on testnet will consider witnessed / finalized tips final and will not unwind past those witness points or follow a chain that disagrees with a known finalized tip.
