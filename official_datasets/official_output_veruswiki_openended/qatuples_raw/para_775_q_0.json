    "What are the warranty and liability terms for using Verus software, and why might some antivirus software flag Verus as a potential threat?",
    "The Verus software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty, expressed or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that the authors and copyright holders of Verus software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software.\n\nRegarding the antivirus software flags, some antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky might flag Verus as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is not because Verus is malicious software, but rather because it is mining software that can be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC. The antivirus software is simply warning users that they are installing mining software.\n\nIt's essential to understand that these flags are false positives, and Verus is not malicious software. You can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives. The links provided in the text offer more information on why Verus is flagged and how to understand these warnings.",
