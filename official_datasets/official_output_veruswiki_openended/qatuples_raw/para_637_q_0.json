    "What are some key updates and features in Verus v0.9.5, and how do they impact mainnet and testnet users?",
    "Verus v0.9.5 is a critical update that brings several important features and fixes to the Verus network. Here are some of the key updates and their implications for mainnet and testnet users:\n\n**Mainnet Updates:**\nFor mainnet users, this release labels spendable transactions for the `getaddressutxos` RPC API, which is used by Verus Mobile. This update is crucial for users who have not upgraded to v0.9.5+ before a specific block height, as it ensures that they can continue to use the Verus mainnet reliably.\n\n**Testnet Updates:**\nFor testnet users, v0.9.5-2 introduces minor notarization fixes that are essential for those planning to launch and witness PBaaS chains. These fixes will help ensure the smooth operation of PBaaS chains on the testnet.\n\n**Ethereum Bridge:**\nThe Ethereum bridge, which allows for cross-chain transactions between Verus and Ethereum, is expected to be deployed on the new Verus testnet soon. Once deployed, users will be able to access the bridge at https://ethtest.verus.services/ and use their MetaMask wallets to convert or send assets between the two networks. To use these features, users will need to obtain some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.\n\nOverall, Verus v0.9.5 is an important update that brings significant improvements to the Verus network, particularly for mainnet and testnet users. By upgrading to this version, users can ensure that they can continue to use the Verus network reliably and take advantage of its features.",
