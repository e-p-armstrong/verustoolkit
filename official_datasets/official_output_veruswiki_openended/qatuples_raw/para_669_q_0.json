    "How do I create a currency on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements for launching a currency, including defining a currency, funding the identity of the currency, and converting other tokens to the new currency?",
    "To create a currency on the Verus platform, you need to have an ID of the same name as the currency you want to create. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\n\nLet's break down the process of creating a currency into several steps:\n\n**Defining a Currency:** The first step is to define the currency using the `definecurrency` command. This command takes a JSON object as an argument, which specifies the properties of the currency. For example, to define a currency called \"gold\", you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a currency called \"gold\" with specific properties, such as the conversion rate to VRSCTEST and the preallocation of tokens to a specific ID.\n\n**Funding the Identity of the Currency:** Before launching the currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. This is a requirement for launching a currency.\n\n**Launching the Currency:** Once the identity of the currency is funded, you can launch the currency by sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command. The launch process happens as part of the mining process, and mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new currency.\n\n**Converting Other Tokens to the New Currency:** After the currency is launched, you can convert other tokens to the new currency using the `sendcurrency` command. For example, to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"GOLD@\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"currency\":\"GOLD\",\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command converts 100 VRSCTEST to GOLD at the specified conversion rate.\n\nIn summary, creating a currency on the Verus platform involves defining the currency, funding the identity of the currency, launching the currency, and converting other tokens to the new currency.",
    "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTES",
