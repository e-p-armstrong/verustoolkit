    "What are the key benefits of the v0.7.4 update for the Verus testnet, and how does it improve the functionality of VerusIDs, particularly in terms of cross-chain use and exportation?",
    "The v0.7.4 update for the Verus testnet is a highly recommended, non-mandatory update that brings significant improvements to the functionality of VerusIDs, particularly in terms of cross-chain use and exportation. This update prepares the Verus testnet for the launch of the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge, as well as the mainnet launch of Verus PBaaS multi-chain, multi-currency, Verus Vault ID timelocking, and Verus MEV-resistant DeFi.\n\nOne of the key benefits of this update is the ability to export an ID from one chain to another using the \"exportid\":true parameter in sendcurrency. This enables cross-chain use of VerusIDs, allowing users to export an ID from one chain to another and use it directly on the destination chain. The ID only needs to be exported once, and it can then be managed and used directly on the destination chain.\n\nThe update also fixes all known functionality issues reported from the previous testnet, including issues related to currency and blockchain launches, as well as the ability to incorrectly reduce the timelock period on a Verus Vault locked ID.\n\nAnother important feature of this update is the ability to send to IDs cross-chain, allowing users to send funds to an ID on a different chain. This is achieved using the `sendcurrency` command with the \"exportto\" parameter, specifying the name of the destination chain.\n\nTo take advantage of these new features, users must delete the vrsctest and.verustest/pbaas or VerusTest\\pbaas folders beforehand, and then update to v0.7.4.\n\nIn summary, the v0.7.4 update brings significant improvements to the functionality of VerusIDs, enabling cross-chain use and exportation, and preparing the Verus testnet for the launch of the Ethereum bridge and other key features.",

It also includes the ability to export an ID from one chain to another, using the \u201cexportid\u201d:true parameter in sendcurrency, enabling cross-chain use of VerusIDs. With this release, we will be resetting the Verus testnet. To use the new testnet, you must make sure to delete the vrsctest and .verustest/pbaas or VerusTest\\pbaas folders beforehand.In addition to being prepared for the Ethereum bridge launch, this release adds some new testnet capabilities, including the ability to send to IDs cross chain and export IDs from chain to chain using the `\u201cexportid\u201d:true` parameter with `sendcurrency`. IDs only need to be exported once and can then be used and managed directly as a forked ID on the destination chain.## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n  ```",
