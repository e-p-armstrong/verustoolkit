    "What are the key improvements and fixes introduced in the VerusCoin 0.4.0 series, specifically in versions 0.4.0c, 0.4.0e, 0.4.0f, and 0.4.0g, and how do they enhance the user experience and stability of the Verus platform?",
    "The VerusCoin 0.4.0 series introduces several significant improvements and fixes to the Verus platform. Let's break down the key features and enhancements in each version:\n\n**0.4.0c:**\nThis version, released on an unspecified date, lays the foundation for the subsequent improvements.\n\n**0.4.0e:**\nThis version resolves several community-reported issues, including:\n\n1. Coinbase shielding problems to Sapling and Sprout private addresses, which are now fixed.\n2. Staking now defaults to sending the coinbase to the address that staked the reward, unless a specific public key is specified using the `-pubkey` option. The public key can be determined using the `validateaddress` command.\n3. The Agama GUI now displays a cleaner view of staking transactions and minted coinbases, making it easier to understand and distinguish between different transaction types.\n\n**0.4.0f:**\nBuilding upon the improvements in 0.4.0e, this version introduces:\n\n1. More detailed information about stake (winner of the contest) and mint (staked reward) transactions in both the Agama GUI and CLI `listtransactions` command.\n2. Safeguards against double staking behavior caused by forks and reorgs, ensuring the integrity of the staking process.\n3. The ability to set the maximum number of transparent and private transactions in Agama through the settings -> App config.\n\n**0.4.0g:**\nThis version includes all the improvements from 0.4.0f and adds an expiry on stake transactions, allowing for their deletion from wallets later.\n\nThese improvements and fixes in the VerusCoin 0.4.0 series enhance the overall stability and user experience of the Verus platform, making it more reliable and easier to use for stakeholders and users.",
    "https://medium.com/veruscoin/veruscoin-0-5-0-official-release-notes-6d371095dc7a\nv0.4.0h fixes address indexes for the insight explorer and some APIs, as well as a rare segfault in network reorg edge cases from the cheatcatcher.\nVersion 0.4.0g includes all improvements in 0.4.0f and an expiry on stake transactions to allow deletion from wallets later\nVersion 0.4.0f includes all improvements in 0.4.0e.\nIn addition, it provides more detail about stake (winner of the contest) and mint (staked reward) transactions in Agama GUI as well as CLI listtransactions. It also introduces safeguards against any possibility of double staking behavior caused by forks and reorgs and the ability to set the maximum number of transparent and private transactions in Agama in settings->App config.\n0.4.0e fixes issues and introduces a much cleaner view of staking transactions and minted coinbases in the Agama GUI. The following community reported issues are resolved:\n1. Coinbase shielding problems to Sapling and sometimes to Sprout private addresses are resolved\n2. Staking will again default to sending the coinbase to the address that staked the reward unless **-pubkey=66charpubkey** is set. The public key of an address where you would like the coinbases to go can be determined using **\"validateaddress\"** either in the CLI or GUI.\n3. Agama GUI no longer shows ins and outs or multiple lines for a staking transaction. Instead, it now displays an easy to understand single line for each \"stake\" transaction and also easily distinguishes between mined and minted coinbases once they are mature.\n## 0.4.0c - released 10/29/2018",
