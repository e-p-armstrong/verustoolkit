    "What features does Verus offer for launching a new blockchain, and how do these features provide flexibility and scalability for new use cases?",
    "Verus offers several features for launching a new blockchain, providing flexibility and scalability for new use cases. These features include:\n\n**Simultaneous Blockchain and Liquidity Pool Launches:** Verus allows for the simultaneous launch of a new blockchain and a decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This bridge converter liquidity pool is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This provides seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and the Verus network.\n\n**Blockchain-based Crowdfunding Currency Launches:** Verus offers a blockchain-based crowdfunding system for launching new currencies. This system allows for minimum participation requirements, automatic refunds if minimums are not met, and various launch options such as pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations, and vesting schedules. This provides a flexible and secure way to launch new currencies.\n\n**Interoperable Multichain Network:** Verus offers an interoperable multichain network, allowing for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. This is made possible by Notary IDs, which provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, allowing for unlimited scale and new use cases.\n\nOverall, Verus provides a robust and flexible platform for launching new blockchains and currencies, with features such as simultaneous launches, blockchain-based crowdfunding, and an interoperable multichain network. These features enable new use cases and provide unlimited scalability for the Verus network.",
    "ols.\n### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as",
