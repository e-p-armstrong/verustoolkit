    "What are the different ways to lock and unlock IDs in Verus, and how do conversion queries work in the context of Verus's interoperable blockchain ecosystem?",
    "In the Verus ecosystem, IDs can be locked and unlocked in various ways to control their usage and security. Additionally, conversion queries can be used to retrieve information about currencies that have sufficient reserves and meet certain liquidity thresholds.\n\n**Locking and Unlocking IDs:**\n IDs in Verus can be locked and unlocked using the `updateidentity` command. There are two types of locks: Time Lock and Time Delay.\n\n**Time Lock:** A Time Lock sets the unlock height of an identity, specifying the block height at which the ID will be unlocked. To set a Time Lock, use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter set to the desired unlock block height. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Time Delay:** A Time Delay sets a delay for an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. To set a Time Delay, use the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter set to the desired unlock block delay. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Revoking an Identity:** Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of any Time Delay or unlock height settings. Note that a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**Conversion Queries:**\nConversion queries in Verus allow you to retrieve information about currencies that meet certain liquidity thresholds. The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\nFor example, to retrieve all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return a list of currencies that meet the specified criteria.\n\nIn summary, Verus's ID locking and unlocking mechanisms provide a robust way to control ID usage and security, while conversion queries enable users to retrieve information about currencies that meet certain liquidity thresholds, facilitating the creation of interoperable blockchain ecosystems.",
    "k is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\nThe timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\nThe timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n## Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nWill return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
