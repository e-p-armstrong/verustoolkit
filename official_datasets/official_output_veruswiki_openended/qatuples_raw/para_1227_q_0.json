    "How do I create and launch a new currency on the Verus network, and what are the requirements for doing so?",
    "To create a currency on the Verus network, you need to have an ID with the same name as the currency you want to create. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\n\nLet's break down the process of creating and launching a new currency on Verus. In this example, we'll assume you have three IDs: gold@, mycoin@, and mike@. You want to create a currency called gold@, which is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold. You also want to create a token called mycoin@, which is similar to a Kickstarter campaign, where a business offers to attribute utility or product value to the coins if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\n\nTo define the currency \"gold\", you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines the currency \"gold\" with specific properties, such as its name, options, currencies it can be converted to, conversion rates, minimum pre-conversion amounts, and pre-allocations.\n\nIn this example, the pre-allocation is set to 50,000,000 units of gold@, which is sent to the ID mike@. Since this is a test currency, you would want to send some gold@ to yourself to start with.\n\nNote that the requirements for creating a currency on Verus include having an ID with the same name as the currency, and being the controller of that ID. The ID controller can only create a currency of that name once.",
    "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start.
