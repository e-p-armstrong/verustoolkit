    "How do you use the Verus command line to export funds from a PBaaS chain to VRSCTEST, and what does each part of the command do?",
    "To export funds from a PBaaS chain to VRSCTEST, you can use the `sendcurrency` command on the Verus command line. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```json\nverus -chain=PBaaSChain sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"exportto\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"via\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\"}]'\n```\n\nLet's break down what each part of this command does:\n\n* `verus -chain=PBaaSChain` : This specifies that we are using the Verus command line to interact with the PBaaSChain blockchain.\n* `sendcurrency` : This command is used to send funds from one address to another.\n* `*` : This is the \"from\" address, which in this case is a wildcard character, meaning the funds will be sent from the default address associated with the PBaaSChain blockchain.\n* `[{\"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"exportto\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"via\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\"}]'` : This is a JSON object that specifies the details of the transaction.\n\t+ `address` : This is the \"to\" address, which is the address that will receive the funds.\n\t+ `amount` : This is the amount of funds to be sent.\n\t+ `convertto` : This specifies that the funds should be converted to VRSCTEST before being sent.\n\t+ `exportto` : This specifies that the funds should be exported to the VRSCTEST blockchain.\n\t+ `via` : This specifies that the Bridge.PBaaSChain should be used to facilitate the transaction.\n\nBy using this command, you can export funds from a PBaaS chain to VRSCTEST, taking advantage of the bridge functionality to convert and transfer the funds between blockchains.",
