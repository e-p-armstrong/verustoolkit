    "What are common errors you might encounter when running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution, and how can you resolve them?",
    "When running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution, such as Debian or Devuan, you might encounter errors related to missing dependencies. Two common errors you might see are:\n```\nerror while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory\nerror while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory\n```\nThese errors occur because the required libraries, `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev`, are not installed by default on your Linux distribution.\n\nTo resolve these errors, you need to install the missing libraries. You can do this by running the following command:\n```\nsudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev\n```\nThis command will install the required libraries, and you should be able to run `./verusd` without encountering these errors.",
