    "What are VerusIDs, and how do they differ from other blockchain ID implementations? Additionally, what are some potential issues with installing Verus software, and what recent updates have been made to the Verus mainnet protocol?",
    "VerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. This means that VerusIDs are decentralized and not controlled by a single entity. VerusIDs provide plenty of opportunities for identity applications, such as quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses, fully decentralized protocol, revocability, recoverability, privacy, and power.\n\nRegarding the installation of Verus software, some antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software includes mining capabilities, which can be exploited by third parties to misuse your computer's resources. However, this does not mean that the software is malicious.\n\nRecently, an update was made to the Verus mainnet protocol to include VerusID. This update is mandatory for the upgraded Verus mainnet and fixes an overly aggressive block rejection in the VerusID protocol. The update also includes relative adjustments to the CPU and FPGA-equalizing VerusHash 2.1 Algorithm. This update was activated at block 800200 and is the latest update for the upgraded Verus mainnet.",
