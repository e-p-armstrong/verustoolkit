    "How can you create a new currency on the Verus platform, and what are the implications of setting the `proofprotocol` to `PROOF_CHAINID`?",
    "To create a new currency on the Verus platform, you can use the `definecurrency` command. This command allows you to define the properties of the new currency, such as its name, options, proof protocol, currencies it can be converted from, minimum pre-conversion amounts, and initial supply.\n\nFor example, to create a new currency called \"mycoin\" with the options set to 97, proof protocol set to `PROOF_CHAINID`, and convertible from `vrsctest` and `gold` currencies, you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nBy setting the `proofprotocol` to `PROOF_CHAINID` (which is represented by the value 2), you are giving the controller of the chain ID the ability to mint new coins. This means that the controller can create new coins and add them to the supply, which can be useful for various use cases, such as rewarding nodes or incentivizing certain behaviors.\n\nTo mint new coins, the controller can use the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option set to 1. For example, to mint 10,000 new coins and send them to the address `mike@`, the controller would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis would increase the total supply of \"mycoin\" by 10,000 units, and the new coins would be sent to the specified address.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
