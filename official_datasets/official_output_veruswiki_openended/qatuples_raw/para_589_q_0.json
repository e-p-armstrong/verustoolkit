    "How do I define a new currency in Verus, and what are the steps to launch it and convert other currencies to it?",
    "Defining a new currency in Verus involves several steps. First, you need to define the currency using the `definecurrency` command. For example, let's say you want to define a currency called \"gold\". You would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines the properties of the \"gold\" currency, such as its name, options, currencies it can be converted to, conversion rates, and preallocations.\n\nBefore the currency can be launched, it needs to be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST and have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD. This is done as part of the mining process, and miners who participate in the launch will earn a 0.025% conversion fee.\n\nOnce the currency is launched, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will park the conversion until the GOLD token launches, and then you will either receive 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\nAfter the currency is launched, you can create a new currency that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. For example, let's say you want to create a currency called \"mycoin\". You would use the `definecurrency` command again, specifying the properties of \"mycoin\" and its conversion rates with GOLD and VRSCTEST.\n\nOverall, defining and launching a new currency in Verus involves several steps, including defining the currency's properties, funding it, and converting other currencies to it.",
    " \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
