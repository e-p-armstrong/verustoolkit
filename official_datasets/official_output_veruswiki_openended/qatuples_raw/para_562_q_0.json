    "What is Verus Vault, and how does it protect funds on a VerusID, including from private key theft, and what are some additional features and benefits of using Verus Vault?",
    "Verus Vault is a feature that allows you to protect funds on a VerusID, even if your private key is stolen. When you lock your VerusID with Vault, you cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. However, you can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network to earn rewards.\n\nTo use Verus Vault, you need to have at least one primary identity and one revocation/recovery ID configured. A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which can circumvent the lock. This means that if someone tries to unlock your identity without authorization, the revocation and recovery authority can detect this and recover the funds.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Verus Vault is that it provides a decentralized solution to the \"5 dollar wrench attack\", where an attacker steals your private key by physical means. With Verus Vault, you can set a delay between the time someone tries to unlock your identity and the time when they can actually access the funds. This delay can be set to any length of time, providing an additional layer of security.\n\nIn addition to protecting funds, Verus Vault also provides security for your IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other purposes such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This means that you can use Verus Vault to protect and recover not only your funds but also your digital assets and legacy.\n\nOverall, Verus Vault offers a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, allowing you to preserve your assets and generational blockchain wealth without relying on traditional banking institutions.",
    "#### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",
