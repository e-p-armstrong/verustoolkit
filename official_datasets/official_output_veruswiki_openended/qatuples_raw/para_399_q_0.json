    "What are the new capabilities of Verus's PBaaS protocol that allow for the creation of temporarily centralized currencies, and how do they extend the concept of a centralized currency?",
    "The new capabilities of Verus's PBaaS protocol enable the creation of temporarily centralized currencies, which can issue identities and have additional features. These capabilities extend the concept of a centralized currency in several ways:\n\nFirstly, the identity of a centralized currency can mint currency on demand as part of the `sendcurrency` command. This allows for dynamic control over the currency supply.\n\nSecondly, a centralized currency can burn a liquidity basket currency, but instead of affecting the supply/reserve ratio, it can adjust the reserve ratio weights of the currency. This provides more flexibility in managing the currency's liquidity.\n\nThirdly, identities can be registered on a centralized currency. In this case, the registration fee is not burned into the currency but is sent directly to the identity of the currency. This is in contrast to decentralized currencies, where fees are burned and either reduce the supply or add to the liquidity pool.\n\nFourthly, when a centralized currency reaches its endblock, all centralized capabilities of the same ID cease, and the currency is converted to a decentralized currency with no special control over it. This ensures that the currency can continue to exist and be used even after the centralized period has ended.\n\nLastly, Verus's PBaaS protocol now allows decentralized non-liquidity tokens to register identities, which was not possible in previous versions. This provides more flexibility and functionality for decentralized currencies.\n\nThese new capabilities extend the concept of a centralized currency by providing more control and flexibility over the currency's supply, liquidity, and identity registration.",
    "### What\u2019s New\nIn addition to the full PBaaS protocol and all capabilities previously described, version 1.0.1 will also include some new capabilities that were previously not in the PBaaS protocol. The capabilities basically extend the idea of a centralized currency to include the ability to launch temporarily centralized currencies, including those that can issue identities. This is achieved by setting the \u201cendblock\u201d on a centralized currency launch of either a token or liquidity basket, enabling:\n 1) Minting of currency on demand by the identity of the currency as part of the `sendcurrency`command.\n 2) Burning a liquidity basket currency, but instead of affecting the supply/reserve ratio as normal burns do, the identity of a centralized currency can also burn currency to affect the reserve ratio weights of the currency.\n 3) Registering identities on a currency. When an identity is registered on a centralized currency, the fee for the registration is not burned into the currency, but sent directly to the identity of the currency. This is true for token or liquidity basket currencies. For decentralized currencies, fees are burned, which on a liquidity basket, puts them into the liquidity pool for all LPs to share in earnings, and for a standard token, reduces the supply and available future registrations on that currency.\n 4) In v1.0.1, setting the endblock of a centralized currency causes all centralized capabilities of the same ID to end, converting it in whatever state it currently is in a decentralized currency with no special control over it after that occurs by any identity on the network.\n 5) v1.0.0 did not allow a decentralized non-liquidity token to register identities. v1.0.1 does.",
