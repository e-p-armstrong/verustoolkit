    "What additional capabilities does Verus provide, and how do they enhance the user experience?",
    "Verus offers several additional capabilities that enhance its functionality and user experience. These capabilities include:\n\n**On-chain Launches:** Verus allows for on-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, making it a versatile platform for various use cases. Additionally, it enables the launch and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without requiring programming knowledge.\n\n**Verus ID and NFT Marketplace:** The Verus ID and NFT marketplace enables users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain, allowing for decentralized and transparent transactions. This marketplace allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions can be executed in a completely decentralized manner, with the option to pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address.\n\n**Verus Vault:** Verus Vault is a feature that allows users to protect funds on a VerusID even in the event of a private key theft. By locking a VerusID with Vault, users cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. While locked, users can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. Additionally, users can still receive funds. To enable Verus Vault capabilities, users need to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.\n\nThese additional capabilities demonstrate Verus's commitment to providing a comprehensive and secure platform for its users, enabling them to take full control of their digital assets and identities.",
