    "What are some important considerations and limitations to keep in mind when using Verus Desktop, especially when creating a PBaaS chain, and what kind of warranty or liability does the software come with?",
    "When using Verus Desktop, there are some important considerations and limitations to keep in mind. One key limitation is that if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is currently a known issue and will be addressed before the mainnet release.\n\nIt's also important to note that Verus Desktop is still experimental and unfinished software, and you use it at your own risk. The software comes with no warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that the authors or copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software.\n\nIn other words, you should be aware that the software is still in development and may have bugs or issues that could cause problems. You should use it with caution and understand that you are responsible for any consequences of using the software.\n\nOn the other hand, the software is open-source, which means you have the freedom to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, as long as you include the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the software. This allows developers to contribute to the software and make it better for everyone.",
