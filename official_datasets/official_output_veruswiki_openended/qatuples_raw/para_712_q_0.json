    "What are the requirements and steps to initiate a currency launch on the Verus network, and how can I convert VRSCTEST to a new token or create a new token that can be converted to with other tokens?",
    "To initiate a currency launch on the Verus network, there are certain requirements that must be met. Firstly, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST. Additionally, a minimum of 1000 VRSCTEST must be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per unit of the new token (in this case, GOLD) in order for the launch to be successful.\n\nOnce these requirements are met, the launch process can be initiated by sending a transaction to the network. This transaction will be mined into a block, and the launch will occur 50 blocks after the transaction was made (by default).\n\nDuring the mining process, the miners who mine the blocks that launch the currency will earn a 0.025% conversion fee, which will be paid in the new token (GOLD). This fee is a reward for their participation in the launch process.\n\nIf you want to convert your VRSCTEST to the new token (GOLD) before the launch, you can use the `sendcurrency` command to \"park\" your conversion. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will reserve your conversion until the token launches. Once the launch occurs, you will either receive the converted amount of GOLD or have your VRSCTEST returned to your wallet.\n\nAfter the launch, you can create a new token (mycoin) that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. To do this, you will need to define the properties of the new token, such as its name, options, and conversion rates, using the `definecurrency` command.\n\nFor example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines a new token called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either VRSCTEST or GOLD. The `options` property sets the token's properties, `proofprotocol` specifies the proof protocol used to secure the token, `currencies` lists the tokens that can be converted to mycoin, `minpreconversion` sets the minimum conversion rates, and `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of the token.",
    "urrency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
