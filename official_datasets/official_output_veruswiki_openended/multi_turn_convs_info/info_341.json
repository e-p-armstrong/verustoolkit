            "How can I use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds on the Verus testnet, including sending funds from a single address to a single recipient, sending funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, converting funds to a fractional basket currency, and converting funds to another reserve?",
            "The `sendcurrency` API is a powerful tool on the Verus testnet that allows you to send and convert funds in various ways. Here are some examples of how you can use it:\n\n**Sending Funds from a Single Address:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` API to send funds from a single address to a single recipient. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from an address \"bob@\" to an address \"alice@\", you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Sending Funds from All Private Wallet Funds:**\nYou can also use the `sendcurrency` API to send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients. To do this, you would use the \"*\" wildcard to specify all private funds, and then list the recipients and amounts in a JSON array. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses \"alice@:private\" and \"bob@:private\", you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Converting Funds to a Fractional Basket Currency:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API also allows you to convert funds to a fractional basket currency. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency called VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source, you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\n**Converting Funds to Another Reserve:**\nFinally, you can use the `sendcurrency` API to convert funds to another reserve through a fractional currency. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to BTC through a fractional currency VRSC-BTC, you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\"}]'\n```\nIt's important to note that all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset.",
