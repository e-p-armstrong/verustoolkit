            "How can I use the `sendcurrency` command to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token, and later create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST?",
            "The `sendcurrency` command can be used to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token, such as GOLD, before the new token launches. This is done by specifying the `convertto` and `preconvert` parameters in the command. Here's an example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command parks the conversion of 100 VRSCTEST to GOLD until the GOLD token launches. Once the GOLD token launches, you will either receive 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or your original 100 VRSCTEST will be returned.\n\nLater, if you want to create a new token, called `mycoin`, that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can use the `definecurrency` command. This command allows you to define the properties of the new token, including the currencies that it can be converted to.\n\nHere's an example of how you can create `mycoin`:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\n\nThis command defines the `mycoin` token, specifying its name, options, proof protocol, currencies that it can be converted to, and initial supply. The `currencies` parameter specifies that `mycoin` can be converted to with either VRSCTEST or GOLD.",
            "T sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
