            "How do you manage ID locking and unlocking on the Verus network, and what are conversion queries used for?",
            "In the Verus network, IDs can be locked or unlocked using the `updateidentity` command. There are two types of locking mechanisms: Time Lock and Time Delay.\n\n**Time Lock:**\nA Time Lock sets the unlock height of an identity, which means that the ID will be unlocked at a specific block height. To set a Time Lock, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Time Delay:**\nA Time Delay sets a delay in blocks before an ID is unlocked when its flags are set back to an unlocked state. To set a Time Delay, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of the Time Delay or Unlock Height.\n* A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**Conversion Queries:**\nConversion queries are used to retrieve information about currencies that have a certain level of liquidity. The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves.\n\nFor example, to retrieve all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return a list of currencies that meet the specified criteria.",
            "k is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n## Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n## Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g.
