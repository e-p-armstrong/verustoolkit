            "To convert your Verus Lite mode wallet to Native mode and import your existing address, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Prepare for the Conversion**\nBefore you start, make sure you have your seed phrase and password for your Lite mode wallet readily available. Also, take note of your current Verus (VRSC) address and balance.\n\n**Step 2: Update Verus-Desktop**\nEnsure you have the latest version of Verus-Desktop installed. Download the latest version, verify the signature of the download to ensure it's untampered, and then install it.\n\n**Step 3: Prepare Verus-Desktop for Native Mode**\nLaunch Verus-Desktop, enter your profile, and deactivate Verus Lite if it's currently active. Then, click `+ Add Coin`, select **Verus** from the dropdown list, and choose **Native** as the mode. You can also opt to start staking and mining, and specify the number of threads to use for mining. Click `Add Coin` to complete this step.\n\n**Step 4: Import Your Existing Address**\nFollow the instructions outlined in the [Import Lite wallet address in Verus Desktop native](https://wiki.verus.io/#!how-to/how-to_convert-seed-to-wif.md) guide to import your existing address into Verus-Desktop. This will allow you to stake your balance and use Private (sapling) addresses.\n\n**What to Expect**\nDuring the process, you may see a red warning message about Zcash params. This is normal, and Verus-Desktop will automatically download the necessary parameter files if they're not already present. Once the download is complete, Verus-Desktop will synchronize the blockchain, which should only take a few minutes since the majority of the chain is already in place.",
