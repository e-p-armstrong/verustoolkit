            "What are the key features and benefits of using VerusIDs, particularly in terms of security, control, and flexibility?",
            "VerusIDs are a quantum-ready, fully decentralized, and self-sovereign identity system that offers a range of benefits and features. Here are some of the key advantages of using VerusIDs:\n\n**Security:**\nVerusIDs are resistant to quantum attacks using known algorithms, making them a secure choice for transactions and identity management. Although Verus currently doesn't have quantum-resistant signatures for transactions, the VerusID system itself is secure, and a quantum-secure signature scheme is being integrated, which will allow for retroactive quantum resistance of funds sent to an ID.\n\n**Control and Flexibility:**\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If the controlling addresses or properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. This means that users have complete control over their VerusIDs and can update them as needed.\n\n**Decentralization:**\nAnyone can create a VerusID without permission, and all costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. This decentralized approach ensures that users have self-sovereign control over their identities.\n\n**Revocability and Recovery:**\nVerusIDs are revocable, meaning that each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. This authority can revoke the identity, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft. The ID can then be recovered, allowing users to regain control over their funds.\n\n**Interoperability:**\nVerusIDs can be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, making it possible to use VerusIDs across different blockchain ecosystems. However, only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, or manage funds in existing UTXOs.\n\nOverall, VerusIDs offer a powerful and flexible identity management system that provides users with control, security, and decentralization.",
            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerus IDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.",
