            "How do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus testnet or mainnet, and what are some key features of the new Verus multicurrency, multichain, DeFi enabled testnet?",
            "To sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus testnet or mainnet, you need to follow a few steps:\n\n**Step 1: Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data**\nUse the `verus sendcurrency` command to create a transaction from a multi-signature ID, specifying the destination address and transaction amount. This will return an operation ID. Use the `verus z_getoperationstatus` command with the operation ID to get the raw hex transaction data.\n\n**Step 2: Sign the transaction with additional wallets**\nTake the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and use the `verus signrawtransaction` command to sign the transaction.\n\n**Step 3: Broadcast the signed transaction**\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, use the `verus sendrawtransaction` command to broadcast the signed transaction on the network.\n\nNow, about the new Verus multicurrency, multichain, DeFi enabled testnet:\n\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that allows you to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming. With the Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, you can access the testnet and explore its features, such as:\n\n* Sending currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Converting currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way\n* Creating unlimited identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for various use cases, such as business, government, projects, or decentralized applications\n\nThe Verus testnet marks the beginning of a new era in crypto, offering a wide range of possibilities that are not available on other cryptocurrency platforms.",
