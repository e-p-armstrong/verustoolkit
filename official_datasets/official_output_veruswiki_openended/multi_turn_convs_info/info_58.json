            "What are some additional capabilities of Verus, and how do its features, such as Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and Verus Vault, provide secure and decentralized ways to manage digital identities and funds?",
            "Verus offers several additional capabilities that enhance its functionality and provide users with more control over their digital identities and funds.\n\nOne of the key features of Verus is its ability to launch tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs (Automated Market Makers) on-chain, without requiring any programming knowledge. This allows for the creation of independent, connected, and interoperable blockchains, which can be merge-mined, making it easier to launch and manage multiple blockchain projects.\n\nVerus ID and NFT Marketplace is another significant feature of Verus. This decentralized marketplace allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) directly on the blockchain, without the need for intermediaries. Users can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the blockchain for everyone to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. Users can also choose to share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in the digital ownership economy.\n\nVerus Vault is a security feature that allows users to protect their funds on a VerusID, even in the event of a private key theft. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the user cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. However, the user can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. The user can also still receive funds while the VerusID is locked. This feature provides an additional layer of security and protection for users' funds.\n\nOverall, Verus provides a range of features and capabilities that enable users to manage their digital identities and funds in a secure, decentralized, and flexible way.",
            "We expect at least one more non-mandatory release before the mainnet activation, Tuesday at block #2549420, which will add some pool merge mining improvements. Please make sure you update to v1.0.3 or greater before the activation block.### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.#### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.",
