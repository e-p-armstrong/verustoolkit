            "What should I do if I end up on my own fork because of a network issue or having an old version of the wallet, and how can I resolve this issue using either the bootstrap file or searching for the forked block?",
            "If you find yourself on a forked chain due to a network issue or using an outdated version of the wallet, there are two ways to resolve this issue.\n\n**Method 1: Installing the Latest Bootstrap File (Easy, but Large Download)**\nTo resolve the issue using the bootstrap file, follow these steps:\n1. **Stop the wallet or mining process**: Cleanly shut down the wallet or mining program to prevent any further issues.\n2. **Update your wallet (if necessary)**: Make sure your wallet is up-to-date to ensure you have the latest features and fixes.\n3. **Follow the bootstrap procedure**: Refer to the guide on [HOW-TO Backup, Install or Update and Bootstrap your wallet](https://example.com/how-to_bootstrap) to efficiently resolve the issue.\n\nNote that when you mine on the wrong chain, your mining rewards may seem to halt. This is because rewards on the wrong chain are essentially worthless.\n\n**Method 2: Searching for the Forked Block (Time-Consuming, No Extra Download)**\nAlternatively, you can search for the forked block manually. This method is more time-consuming but doesn't require a large download.\n\nIn this case, you'll need to search for the specific block that caused the fork and invalidate it. This process can be complex and time-consuming, but it's a viable option if you don't want to download the bootstrap file.\n\nRegardless of the method you choose, it's essential to resolve the issue as soon as possible to ensure you're back on the correct chain and your mining rewards are valid.",
            "# Question: What should I do if I end up on my own fork because of a network issue or having an old version of the wallet?This solution can be solved in 2 ways: you can simply install the latest bootstrap file (less work, big download) or search manually for the forked block and invalidate that block (time-consuming, no download needed.)## Procedure 1 (Easy, installing bootstrap)For all GUI or CLI users.\n1. Stop the wallet/mining process by cleanly shutting down the program.\n2. Update your wallet if necessary.\n3. Follow the procedure in [HOW-TO Backup, Install or Update and Bootstrap your wallet.md](#!how-to/how-to_bootstrap.md) to efficiently rectify the problem.\n4. Do not be dismayed if it seems that your mining rewards suddenly seem to come to a halt. Remember, when you mine to the wrong chain rewards can come in very quickly, but they are worth nothing.## Procedure 2 (Time consuming, no extra download)",
