            "How can I determine when an immature block will mature in Verus, and what tools are available to automate this process?",
            "In Verus, an immature block will mature after a certain number of blocks have been added to the blockchain. To determine when an immature block will mature, you can use a script that calculates the estimated time based on the current block height and the number of blocks remaining until maturity.\n\nThe script provided is a Linux script that uses the Verus CLI to retrieve the list of transactions and the current block height. It then calculates the estimated time for each immature block to mature by dividing the number of blocks remaining until maturity by 1440 (the approximate number of blocks per day). The script also provides an estimated date for when each block will mature.\n\nTo use the script, you'll need to replace `/XXXX/verus-cli/` with the path to your Verus CLI directory and ensure that the Verus daemon is running. Once you've set up the script, you can run it to get an estimate of when each immature block will mature.\n\nKeep in mind that the actual number of blocks per day may vary, so the estimated dates may change slightly over time. However, this script provides a convenient way to automate the process of checking when immature blocks will mature in Verus.",
            "# How do I know when an immature block will \"unlock\" (mature)?\n\nYou can use the following scripts to automate it (prints, for each block, how many blocks remaining and the estimated date).\nKeep in mind that the actual number of blocks per day is not always exactly 1440. It varies and the estimated dates may change slightly over time. Below you will find the Linux script that will calculate the extimated time for you:\n\n## Script:\n\n```bash\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#Config\nverus_path=\"/XXXX/verus-cli/\"\nverus_cli=\"verus\"\n\nget_transactions=( $($verus_path$verus_cli listtransactions \"\" 1000 0|grep blockstomaturity|sed 's/.e: //;s/,//g'|awk '{ print $2 }'|sort -n) )\ncur_block=( $($verus_path$verus_cli getmininginfo|grep blocks\":|sed 's/.e: //;s/,//g'|awk '{ print $2 }') )\narr_idx=\"0\"\n\nfor i in \"${get_transactions[@]}\"\ndo\n    days_to_mature=$(( ($i )/1440 ))\n    mature_to_date=$(date +\"%m-%d-%Y\" -d \"+$days_to_mature days\")\n    echo \"\"Block #\" $arr_idx \"will mature in approximately\"$days_to_mature \"days\" \"(\" $mature_to_date \")\" \"\n    ((arr_idx++))\ndone\n```\n\nYou'll need to enter the correct path to your verus directory and you will need to have the verus daemon running in order to sucessfully run this script.\n\n(submitted by @TexWiller, edited by @bigtom, reviewed by @Englal)\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-04-24.",
