            "The `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool that allows users to send and convert funds between different currencies and addresses. Here are some examples of how it can be used:\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient. For example, if you want to send 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to the address \"alice@\", you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients:**\nYou can also use the `sendcurrency` API to send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients. For example, if you want to send 10 VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to the addresses \"alice@:private\" and \"bob@:private\", you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API can also be used to convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency. For example, if you want to convert 10 VRSCTEST to the fractional basket currency VRSC-BTC using IDs as a funding source, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\n**Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve through a fractional currency:**\nFinally, the `sendcurrency` API can be used to convert VRSCTEST to another reserve through a fractional currency. For example, if you want to convert 10 VRSCTEST to BTC through the fractional currency VRSC-BTC, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\"}]'\n```\nThese are just a few examples of how the `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds in Verus. By using this API, users can easily move funds between different currencies and addresses, making it a powerful tool for managing their Verus assets.",
