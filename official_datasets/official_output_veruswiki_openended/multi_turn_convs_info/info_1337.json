            "What are some of the advanced features of the Verus protocol that enable users to discover investment opportunities, protect their funds, and manage their identities in a self-sovereign manner?",
            "The Verus protocol offers several advanced features that enable users to discover investment opportunities, protect their funds, and manage their identities in a self-sovereign manner. Two key features are:\n\n**System-wide Queries for Fractional Basket Currencies:**\nVerus's new RPC API, known as `getcurrencyconverters`, allows users to query the entire blockchain network for all registered currencies that meet a certain liquidity threshold and contain one or more reserve currencies. This feature enables wallets or applications to instantly discover the best conversion rates for fractional basket currencies, whether for arbitrage, investment, or conversion bargain hunting. With this feature, users can convert funds at the best possible rates worldwide or select only better-than-market rates for arbitrage opportunities.\n\n**Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault Technology:**\nVerusIDs, which are already revocable, recoverable, and provable blockchain addresses and identities, have been enhanced with Verus Vault technology. This technology adds an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds. This enables easy implementation of various use cases, such as vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, and simplifying estate planning. With Verus Vault technology, users can manage their funds, identity, and estate planning in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind that they are protected from lost or stolen private keys.",
            "- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.",
