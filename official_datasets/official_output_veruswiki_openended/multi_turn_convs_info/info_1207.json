            "The `getrawtransaction` command in Verus is used to retrieve information about a specific transaction, identified by its transaction ID (TXID). This command can be used in various ways to retrieve different levels of detail about the transaction.\n\n**Basic Usage:**\nThe basic usage of `getrawtransaction` is to retrieve the raw transaction data for a specific transaction. This can be done by providing the TXID of the transaction as an argument to the command. For example:\n```\nverus getrawtransaction \"mytxid\"\n```\nThis will return the raw transaction data for the transaction with the specified TXID.\n\n**Verbose Mode:**\nBy adding a second argument of `1` to the command, you can enable verbose mode, which provides more detailed information about the transaction. For example:\n```\nverus getrawtransaction \"mytxid\" 1\n```\nThis will return the raw transaction data, as well as additional information such as the block time in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, GMT).\n\n**Using JSON-RPC:**\nThe `getrawtransaction` command can also be used with JSON-RPC to retrieve transaction information. This allows you to use the command programmatically, for example, using a tool like `curl`. For example:\n```bash\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getrawtransaction\", \"params\": [\"mytxid\", 1] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nThis will send a JSON-RPC request to the Verus server, which will return the raw transaction data and additional information in JSON format.\n\nIn summary, the `getrawtransaction` command in Verus is a powerful tool for retrieving information about specific transactions. It can be used in various ways, including basic usage, verbose mode, and with JSON-RPC, to provide detailed information about transactions on the Verus network.",
