            "What should I know before installing Verus on my computer, and how do I ensure I have the latest version with bug fixes?",
            "Before installing Verus on your computer, there are a few important things to be aware of:\n\n**Virus Detection:** Some anti-virus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus installation as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because Verus is mining software, and some anti-virus programs may detect it as a potential threat. However, this is a false positive, and Verus is not malicious software.\n\n**False Positives:** If your anti-virus software flags Verus as a threat, you can review the resources provided to learn more about false positives. Malwarebytes and Kaspersky have written blog posts explaining why Verus may be detected as a PUP.\n\n**Upgrading:** It's crucial to keep your Verus software up to date. Version 0.5.5b introduced bug fixes for staking status not reverting to true after performing a z-transaction. **Make sure to upgrade to version 0.5.5 or greater as soon as possible** to ensure you have the latest bug fixes.\n\n**Experimental Software:** Verus is still experimental and unfinished software. Use it at your own risk, and be aware that there is no warranty for any kind of damage.\n\n**License:** Verus is open-source software, and you have the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, subject to the conditions outlined in the license agreement.\n\nIn summary, before installing Verus, be aware of potential false positives from anti-virus software, make sure to upgrade to the latest version, and understand that Verus is still experimental software.",
