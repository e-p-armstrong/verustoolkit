            "How can I use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds on the Verus testnet, including sending funds from a single address to a single recipient, from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, converting funds to a fractional basket currency, and converting funds to another reserve through a fractional currency?",
            "The `sendcurrency` API is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds on the Verus testnet. Here are some examples of how you can use it:\n\n**Sending Funds from a Single Address:**\nTo send funds from a single address to a single recipient, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis will send 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to the address \"alice@\".\n\n**Sending Funds from All Private Wallet Funds:**\nTo send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis will send 10 VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to the addresses \"alice@:private\" and \"bob@:private\".\n\n**Converting Funds to a Fractional Basket Currency:**\nTo convert funds to a fractional basket currency, such as VRSC-BTC, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis will convert 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to VRSC-BTC.\n\n**Converting Funds to Another Reserve through a Fractional Currency:**\nTo convert funds to another reserve, such as BTC, through a fractional currency, such as VRSC-BTC, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis will convert 10 VRSCTEST from the address \"bob@\" to BTC through the fractional currency VRSC-BTC.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how you can use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds on the Verus testnet. Note that all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset.",
