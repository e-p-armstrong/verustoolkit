            "How do I create and launch a new currency on the Verus blockchain, and what are some considerations I need to keep in mind when doing so?",
            "To create a new currency on the Verus blockchain, you need to have an ID with the same name as the currency you want to create. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once.\n\nLet's take the example of creating two currencies, `gold@` and `mycoin@`. To define the `gold@` currency, you would use the `definecurrency` command with specific options. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines the `gold@` currency with specific properties, such as the conversion rate to `vrsctest` and the pre-allocation of funds to the `mike@` ID.\n\nBefore launching the currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 `VRSCTEST` and pre-convert at least 1000 `VRSCTEST` to `GOLD` at a rate of 0.01 `VRSCTEST` per `GOLD`. This is done as part of the mining process, and miners who participate in the launch earn a 0.025% conversion fee.\n\nOnce the currency is launched, you can use it to represent value on the Verus blockchain. In the case of `gold@`, you might want to map it to a specific, auditable store of gold to give it intrinsic value. For `mycoin@`, you might want to attribute utility or product value to it, such as through a Kickstarter-like model.\n\nSome important considerations to keep in mind when creating and launching a new currency on Verus include:\n\n* Ensuring that the identity of the currency is properly funded and pre-converted before launch\n* Choosing the right options and conversion rates for your currency\n* Understanding the role of mining and conversion fees in the launch process\n* Developing a plan for how to give value to your currency, whether through mapping it to a physical asset or attributing utility or product value to it.",
            "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, t",
