            "How do I create a currency on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements for doing so?",
            "To create a currency on the Verus platform, you need to have an ID with the same name as the currency you want to create. Only the controller of this ID can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once. \n\nLet's break down an example to illustrate this process. Suppose you have three IDs: `gold@`, `mycoin@`, and `mike@`. You want to create a currency called `gold@` that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold. You also want to create a token called `mycoin@`, which is similar to a Kickstarter, where a business offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\n\nTo define the currency `gold@`, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines the currency `gold@` with specific properties, such as the option to convert it to `vrsctest` at a rate of 0.01, and a minimum pre-conversion amount of 1000. The `preallocations` property allows you to allocate a certain amount of the currency to a specific ID, in this case, `mike@`.\n\nNote that the ID `gold@` is required to create the currency `gold@`, and only the controller of `gold@` can create this currency. Additionally, this currency can only be created once.\n\nIn general, creating a currency on the Verus platform requires a unique ID with the same name as the currency, and the controller of that ID must define the currency properties using the `definecurrency` command.",
            "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start.
