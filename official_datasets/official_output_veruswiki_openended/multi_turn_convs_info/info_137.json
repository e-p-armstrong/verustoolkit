            "How do I create a currency in Verus, and what are the implications of creating a currency linked to a specific ID, such as gold@ or mycoin@?",
            "In Verus, creating a currency requires an ID with the same name as the currency. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once. This means that if you want to create a currency called \"gold@\", you need to have an ID named \"gold@\".\n\nWhen you create a currency linked to a specific ID, you have full control over it as the controller of that ID. You can define the properties of the currency, such as its name, supply, and conversion rates. However, this also means that you are responsible for ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of the currency.\n\nIn the case of creating a currency like \"gold@\", you may want to establish a trusted and auditable store of gold to back the currency. This could involve partnering with a reputable gold storage facility or creating a system for tracking and verifying gold reserves. The goal is to ensure that the value of the \"gold@\" currency is directly tied to the value of the underlying gold reserves.\n\nSimilarly, if you want to create a token like \"mycoin@\", you may want to design it as a Kickstarter-style token, where a business or project can issue a limited supply of tokens to raise funds from supporters. In this case, the value of the \"mycoin@\" token would be tied to the success of the business or project, and the token could potentially appreciate in value if the project is successful.\n\nOverall, creating a currency in Verus requires careful planning and consideration of the implications of linking a currency to a specific ID. However, it also offers a high degree of flexibility and control, allowing you to design and launch custom currencies that meet specific needs or goals.",

The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a busines",
