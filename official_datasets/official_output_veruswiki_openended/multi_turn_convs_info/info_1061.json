            "Explain how to use the `submitblock` and `addmergedblock` commands in Verus, including the parameters and possible results, and provide examples of how to use them?",
            "The `submitblock` and `addmergedblock` commands in Verus are used to submit new blocks to the network and add fully prepared blocks to the merge mining queue, respectively.\n\n**`submitblock` Command:**\nThe `submitblock` command attempts to submit a new block to the network. It takes two parameters: `hexdata` and `jsonparametersobject`. `hexdata` is a required string parameter that contains the hex-encoded block data to submit. `jsonparametersobject` is an optional string parameter that contains an object of optional parameters, including `workid`, which is a string parameter that specifies the work ID provided by the server.\n\nThe possible results of the `submitblock` command are:\n\n* \"duplicate\" - the node already has a valid copy of the block\n* \"duplicate-invalid\" - the node already has the block, but it is invalid\n* \"duplicate-inconclusive\" - the node already has the block, but has not validated it\n* \"inconclusive\" - the node has not validated the block, and it may not be on the node's current best chain\n* \"rejected\" - the block was rejected as invalid\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `submitblock` command:\n\n```bash\n> verus submitblock \"mydata\"\n```\n\nYou can also use `curl` to submit a block:\n\n```bash\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"submitblock\", \"params\": [\"mydata\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\n**`addmergedblock` Command:**\nThe `addmergedblock` command adds a fully prepared block and its header to the current merge mining queue of the daemon. It takes two parameters: `hexdata` and `jsonparametersobject`. `hexdata` is a required string parameter that contains the hex-encoded block data to add. `jsonparametersobject` is an optional string parameter that contains an object of optional parameters, which determine the action to take if adding this block would exceed the available merge mining slots.\n\nThe default action to take if adding would exceed available space is to replace the choice with the least ROI if this block provides more.\n\nFor more information on `submitblock` and `addmergedblock` parameters and results, you can refer to the Bitcoin BIP 22 specification and the Verus documentation.",
