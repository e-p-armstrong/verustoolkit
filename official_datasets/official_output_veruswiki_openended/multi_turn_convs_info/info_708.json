            "What are the various command-line options available for configuring the Verus daemon, and how do they impact its behavior and security?",
            "The Verus daemon offers a range of command-line options that allow users to customize its behavior, security settings, and network connectivity. These options can be used to tailor the daemon's performance to specific needs, enhance security, and optimize network interactions.\n\n**Network Configuration Options:**\nThe `-onlynet` option allows users to restrict the daemon's connections to nodes within a specific network (e.g., ipv4, ipv6, or onion). The `-port` option specifies the port number for listening to connections, with default values of 7770 for the mainnet and 17770 for testnet. The `-proxy` option enables connections through a SOCKS5 proxy, while `-proxyrandomize` randomizes credentials for every proxy connection, enabling Tor stream isolation.\n\n**Security Options:**\nThe `-tlsdisable` option disables TLS connections, while `-tlsenforcement` only allows connections to TLS-compatible peers. The `-tlsfallbacknontls` option determines whether to attempt a non-TLS connection if a TLS connection fails. The `-tlsvalidate` option requires peers to have valid certificates. Additionally, options like `-tlskeypath`, `-tlskeypwd`, `-tlscertpath`, and `-tlstrustdir` allow users to specify paths to private keys, certificates, and trusted certificates directories, enabling encryption and authentication.\n\n**Miscellaneous Options:**\nThe `-peerbloomfilters` option enables support for filtering blocks and transactions with Bloom filters. The `-permitbaremultisig` option relays non-P2SH multisig transactions. The `-seednode` option connects to a node to retrieve peer addresses and then disconnects. The `-timeout` option specifies the connection timeout in milliseconds, with a minimum value of 1 and a default value of 5000.\n\n**Tor-Specific Options:**\nThe `-torcontrol` option specifies the Tor control port to use if onion listening is enabled, with a default value of 127.0.0.1:9051. The `-torpassword` option sets the Tor control port password, with an empty default value.\n\n**User Agent Option:**\nThe `-uacomment` option allows users to set a custom User Agent string, which is appended to the `\"subver\"` string on connected nodes. However, using this option can have implications on anonymity.\n\nThese command-line options provide a range of customization possibilities for the Verus daemon, enabling users to fine-tune its behavior, security, and network interactions according to their specific needs and requirements.",
