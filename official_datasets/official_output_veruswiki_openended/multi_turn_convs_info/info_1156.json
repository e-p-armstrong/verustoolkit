            "How do I use Verus commands to send currency, set currency trust, and submit an accepted notarization, and what are the parameters and results for each command?",
            "Verus provides several commands to manage currency transactions, trust, and notarizations. Here's a breakdown of each command, its parameters, and expected results.\n\n**Sending Currency:**\nThe `sendcurrency` command allows you to send currency to a specific address. You can use this command in two ways:\n\n1. **Using the Verus executable:**\n```bash\nverus sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"btc\",\"address\":\"RRehdmUV7oEAqoZnzEGBH34XysnWaBatct\",\"amount\":500.0},...]'\n```\nThis command sends the specified amount of `btc` currency to the address `RRehdmUV7oEAqoZnzEGBH34XysnWaBatct`.\n\n2. **Using cURL:**\n```bash\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"sendcurrency\", \"params\": [\"bob@\", [{\"currency\":\"btc\", \"address\":\"alice@quad\", \"amount\":500.0},...]] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nThis command sends the specified amount of `btc` currency from the `bob@` wallet to the address `alice@quad`.\n\n**Setting Currency Trust:**\nThe `setcurrencytrust` command allows you to manage currency trust ratings. You can use this command to clear all wallet currency trust lists, set ratings for specific currencies, remove ratings for specific currencies, or set a currency trust mode.\n\nHere's an example of the command's JSON parameters:\n```json\n{\n \"clearall\": bool, \n \"setratings\":[{\"currencyid\":JSONRatingObject},...], \n \"removeratings\":[\"currencyid\",...], \n \"currencytrustmode\": <n>\n}\n```\n* `clearall`: A boolean value indicating whether to clear all wallet currency trust lists before performing other operations.\n* `setratings`: An array of objects containing currency IDs and their corresponding rating objects.\n* `removeratings`: An array of currency IDs to remove from the trust list.\n* `currencytrustmode`: A number indicating the trust mode: 0 (spend/list all currencies), 1 (only spend/list approved currencies), or 2 (spend/list all but blocked currencies).\n\n**Submitting an Accepted Notarization:**\nThe `submitacceptednotarization` command allows you to finish an almost complete notarization transaction based on the notary chain and the current wallet or pubkey.\n\nHere's an example of the command's parameters:\n```bash\nsubmitacceptednotarization \"{earnednotarization}\" \"{notaryevidence}\"\n```\n* `earnednotarization`: An object containing the notarization earned on the other system, which is the basis for this transaction.\n* `notaryevidence`: An object containing evidence and notary signatures validating the notarization.\n\nThe result of this command is a transaction ID (txid) if the submission is successful, otherwise, NULL.\n\nIn summary, these Verus commands allow you to manage currency transactions, trust, and notarizations, providing a robust and secure way to interact with the Verus ecosystem.",
