            "How do I define a new currency on the Verus network, and what are the steps involved in launching it? Additionally, how can I convert between currencies, and what are the implications of doing so?",
            "To define a new currency on the Verus network, you can use the `definecurrency` command. For example, let's say you want to define a new currency called \"gold\". You can do this by running the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency called \"gold\" with specific properties, such as the conversion rate to VRSCTEST, the minimum amount of VRSCTEST required to launch the currency, and the pre-allocation of funds to the creator of the currency.\n\nOnce the currency is defined, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command to initiate the currency launch. The launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction was made, and it must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\n\nAfter the currency is launched, you can convert between currencies using the `sendcurrency` command. For example, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either receive 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.\n\nIt's also possible to create a new currency that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. For example, you can create a new currency called \"mycoin\" with the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency called \"mycoin\" with specific properties, such as the conversion rates to VRSCTEST and GOLD, and the initial supply of the currency.\n\nOverall, the Verus network provides a flexible and decentralized way to create and manage currencies, with features such as currency launch, conversion, and pre-allocation of funds.",
            "s, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
