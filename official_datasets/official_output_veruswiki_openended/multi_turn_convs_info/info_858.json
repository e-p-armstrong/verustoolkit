            "How do I define a new currency, specifically a PBaaS chain, using the `definecurrency` command in Verus, and what limitations should I be aware of when creating multi-currency systems?",
            "To define a new currency, specifically a PBaaS chain, using the `definecurrency` command in Verus, you need to pass two JSON objects as arguments to the command. The first JSON object defines the properties of the PBaaS chain, such as its name, options, currencies, conversions, eras, notaries, nodes, and gateway converter properties. The second JSON object defines the overridable defaults of the bridge, including the currencies it supports, initial contributions, and initial supply.\n\nHere is an example of how to define a PBaaS chain:\n```json\n./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"options\":330,\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\"],\"conversions\":[1],\"eras\":[{\"reward\":1200000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0}],\"notaries\":[\"Notary1@\",\"Notary2@\",\"Notary3@\"],\"minnotariesconfirm\":2,\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.111:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node1@\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.112:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node2@\"}],\"gatewayconvertername\":\"Bridge\",\"gatewayconverterissuance\":1000000}' '{\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\",\"PBaaSChain\",\"USD\"],\"initialcontributions\":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],\"initialsupply\":3000000}'\n```\n\nWhen creating multi-currency systems in Verus, there are some limitations to be aware of:\n\n1. **Using i-addresses as names**: It is not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name, as this can cause problems when referring to currencies or identities. This is because an i-address can be interpreted as a calculated ID based on a name registration, rather than an actual name.\n2. **Conflicting currency names**: In the GUI, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use the same name for a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata and will be resolved in future releases.\n\nIt is important to be aware of these limitations to ensure smooth operation of your multi-currency system in Verus.",
            "Now pass those definitions to `definecurrency`\n```json\n./verus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"PBaaSChain\",\"options\":330,\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\"],\"conversions\":[1],\"eras\":[{\"reward\":1200000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0}],\"notaries\":[\"Notary1@\",\"Notary2@\",\"Notary3@\"],\"minnotariesconfirm\":2,\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.111:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node1@\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"111.111.111.112:10000\",\"nodeidentity\":\"Node2@\"}],\"gatewayconvertername\":\"Bridge\",\"gatewayconverterissuance\":1000000}' '{\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\",\"PBaaSChain\",\"USD\"],\"initialcontributions\":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],\"initialsupply\":3000000}'\n```## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.",
