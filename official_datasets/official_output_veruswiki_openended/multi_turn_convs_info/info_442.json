            "How do I create custom currencies on the Verus platform, and what are the implications of controlling an ID with a specific name?",
            "On the Verus platform, creating a custom currency is closely tied to controlling an ID with a specific name. To create a currency of a specific name, you need to have an ID with the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\n\nLet's consider an example to illustrate this. Suppose you have three IDs: `gold@`, `mycoin@`, and `mike@`. You want to create two custom currencies: `gold@` and `mycoin@`.\n\nThe `gold@` currency could be created to represent a trusted, auditable store of gold. To define this currency, you would use the `definecurrency` command, specifying the name, options, currencies, conversions, and preallocations. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a currency called `gold` with specific properties, such as conversion rates and preallocations.\n\nOn the other hand, the `mycoin@` currency could be created to represent a token with utility or product value, similar to a Kickstarter campaign. The process of defining this currency would be similar to the `gold@` example, with the specific properties tailored to the needs of the `mycoin@` token.\n\nIt's essential to note that controlling an ID with a specific name gives you the power to create a currency of that name, but also comes with the responsibility of managing that currency. As the controller of the ID, you would be the only one who can create the currency, and you can only do so once. This ensures that the creation of custom currencies on the Verus platform is secure, trusted, and auditable.",
            "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start.
