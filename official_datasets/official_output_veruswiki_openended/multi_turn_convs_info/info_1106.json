            "What are some limitations and considerations to be aware of when working with multi-currency features in Verus, and what steps should be taken after a testnet reset?",
            "When working with multi-currency features in Verus, there are two important limitations to be aware of. \n\n**Limitation 1: Using i-addresses as currency names**\nIn both the graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI), it is not recommended to create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This can cause problems whenever an i-address or name is used, and will not be supported for creating currencies. To avoid user confusion, the naming system will also expand the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.\n\n**Limitation 2: Currency naming conflicts in GUI (Errata)**\nIn the GUI, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same names as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is expected to be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\n**Testnet Reset Considerations**\nAfter a testnet reset, it is essential to delete certain directories to ensure a smooth transition. The directories to be deleted vary depending on the operating system:\n- On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n- On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n- On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nBy being aware of these limitations and taking the necessary steps after a testnet reset, users can ensure a seamless experience with Verus's multi-currency features.",
            "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/vrsctest\n```**MacOS**\n```\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest\n```**Windows**\n```\n\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST\n```# Disclaimer",
