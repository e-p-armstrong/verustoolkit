            "What are the key features and benefits of VerusIDs, and how do they enable advanced functionality such as staking-capable time locking, multi-currency decentralized tokens, and DeFi liquidity pools?",
            "VerusIDs are strong, self-sovereign identities that can be used as friendly names for cryptocurrency addresses on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. They offer several key features and benefits, including:\n\n**Staking-capable Time Locking and Theft Prevention (Verus Vault):**\nVerusIDs can be locked to prevent funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allow for seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, which prevents unauthorized access to their funds. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID, which ensures the security of the funds. This feature enables a virtually theft-proof workflow and provides a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft.\n\n**Multi-currency, User-created, Decentralized Tokens and Merge-mineable, Interoperable Blockchains:**\nVerusIDs enable any user to create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain. These blockchains are 51% hash attack resistant and can be merge-mined and staked with other blockchains in the Verus network. This allows projects to join the worldwide Verus community and improve the daemon, starting with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities.\n\n**Consensus Integrated DeFi Liquidity Pools and Fractional Currency Baskets:**\nAny ID owner can define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies. This enables advanced DeFi functionality, such as liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets, which can be used to create complex financial instruments and trading strategies.\n\nIn summary, VerusIDs provide a powerful and flexible framework for creating and managing identities, tokens, and blockchains, enabling advanced functionality such as staking-capable time locking, multi-currency decentralized tokens, and DeFi liquidity pools.",

When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user\u2019s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.\n## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming\n - Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets\n- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currenc",
