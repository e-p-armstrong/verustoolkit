            "How does Verus Vault protect my funds on a VerusID, and what features does it offer beyond just protecting my funds?",
            "Verus Vault is a feature that allows you to lock your VerusID, which protects your funds from being spent even if your private key is stolen. While your VerusID is locked, you can still stake your funds on the Verus network and earn rewards, as well as receive new funds. However, you cannot spend any funds from that identity until it is unlocked.\n\nTo use Verus Vault, you need to have at least one primary identity and one revocation/recovery ID configured. If you have a multisig setup, all parties must agree to unlock the identity before funds can be spent.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Locking your VerusID**: You can lock your VerusID using Verus Vault, which prevents anyone, including yourself, from spending funds from that identity.\n2. **Revocation and Recovery**: Even when your VerusID is locked, the revocation and recovery authority identities can still revoke and recover the identity, which circumvents the lock.\n3. **Unlocking**: To unlock your VerusID, you need to wait for a predetermined unlock time, which can be set to a specific delay, such as 24 hours. This delay provides an additional layer of protection against unauthorized unlocks.\n\nVerus Vault offers more than just fund protection. It also provides:\n\n1. **Decentralized fund recovery**: If your funds are stolen, the revocation and recovery authority identities can recover them for you.\n2. **Time locks**: Verus Vault allows you to set time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.\n3. **NFT protection**: Verus Vault also protects your NFTs, ensuring that they are secure and cannot be stolen or tampered with.\n4. **Blockchain protection**: Verus Vault provides a decentralized solution to protect your blockchain assets from common forms of crypto loss or theft.\n\nIn summary, Verus Vault is a powerful feature that offers a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized fund recovery, allowing you to safeguard your assets and generational blockchain wealth without relying on a bank.",
            "#### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",
