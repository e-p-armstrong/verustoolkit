            "What are some limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency features in Verus, and how might these limitations affect your experience?",
            "When using the multi-currency features in Verus, there are two key limitations to be aware of:\n\n**Limitation 1: Using an i-address as an ID name**\nIn Verus, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because an i-address is only interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. While the protocol does not prevent you from creating an ID with an i-address as its name, it is not recommended and may cause problems in various scenarios. To avoid user confusion, the naming system will also expand the set of characters that are not allowed for currency registrations.\n\n**Limitation 2: Currency name conflicts in the GUI (Desktop version)**\nIn the Verus Desktop version, if a currency is already supported (such as BTC or ETH), you cannot use the same name for a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for the testnet release and will not be a limitation in future releases.\n\nIt's also important to note that Verus is still experimental and unfinished software, and users should be aware of the risks involved. The software is provided without warranty, and users are responsible for any potential damage or issues that may arise from its use.",
            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
