            "What kind of warranty does the Verus software come with, and why might some antivirus software flag it as a potential threat?",
            "The Verus software comes with a disclaimer stating that it is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that the authors and copyright holders of the software do not guarantee that it will meet specific standards or perform in a certain way. They also disclaim any liability for damages or other losses arising from the use of the software.\n\nRegarding antivirus software flagging Verus as a potential threat, some antivirus programs like Avast and Kaspersky may detect the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because Verus is a mining software, and some antivirus programs may flag it as a potential threat due to the possibility of it being installed by a third party to exploit the user's computer.\n\nIt is essential to note that these warnings are false positives, and Verus is not a malicious software. The warnings are simply a precautionary measure to inform users that they are installing mining software. For more information on these false positives, users can review the resources provided, such as the Malwarebytes blog and the Kaspersky website.",
