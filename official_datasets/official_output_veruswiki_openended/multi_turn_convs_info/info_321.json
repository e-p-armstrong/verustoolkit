            "What is Verus ID, and how does it address the fundamental problems of blockchain identity and asset control?",
            "Verus ID is a blockchain identity technology that provides a solution to the long-standing issues of decentralized, censorship-resistant public systems. It offers a self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable identity system that combines identity and currency addresses into one, making it easy to use and manage.\n\nTraditionally, blockchain systems have required users to manage multiple private keys, which can be lost, stolen, or compromised, resulting in the loss of cryptocurrency assets. The phrase \"not your keys, not your coins\" emphasizes the importance of controlling one's own private keys. However, this control comes with the risk of losing access to funds if keys are lost or compromised.\n\nVerus ID addresses this issue by creating a system where identity and currency address are one and the same. This means that a user's friendly name can be used as both a reference to their identity and an on-chain destination for funds transfers.\n\nEach Verus ID has a set of addresses (one or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of the identity. This provides an additional layer of security and control. Furthermore, each identity has two additional authorities that have control over the identity:\n\n* The primary authority, which is the self-identity and has control over modifying most aspects of the identity, except its name and parent (which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined).\n* Two additional authorities that have control over revoking and recovering the identity.\n\nThis system provides a robust and flexible way to manage identities and assets on the blockchain, while maintaining decentralization, censorship resistance, and security. By providing a quantum-ready friendly identity system, Verus ID is future-proof and ready for the next generation of blockchain technology.",
            "# Verus ID - A Better Blockchain Identity Technology\nIf you\u2019ve been around crypto for even a little while, you\u2019ll start to hear things like \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d, \u201close your keys, lose your coins\u201d. If you lose your keys, no one will ever be able to recover your money.In fact, trading off decentralized, censorship resistant public systems for this risk to your cryptocurrency assets is such a fundamental issue in blockchain systems today that it is considered an acceptable price for having the benefit of full control over your own funds and blockchain assets.Verus ID provides an elegant solution to these previously unsolved, fundamental problems, and also provides quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities that provide the following advantages over today\u2019s blockchain systems:1. Identity and currency address are one and the same. Your friendly name can be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer.\n2. Each identity must have a set of addresses (1 or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. Each identity also refers to two additional identities that have authority over:\n  - **Primary** - this is the self identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may n",
