            "What are the key features and benefits of the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does Verus Vault enhance the security of funds stored on a VerusID?",
            "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform that allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) directly on the blockchain. This means that transactions are executed peer-to-peer, without the need for intermediaries, and in a completely decentralized manner.\n\nOne of the key benefits of this platform is that users can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the blockchain for all to see. This allows for a transparent and auditable transaction process, while still maintaining the privacy of users through the use of transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses.\n\nAdditionally, the platform allows owners to select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in the digital ownership economy. This enables a new level of flexibility and control for users, while still maintaining the security and decentralization of the Verus network.\n\nVerus Vault is a feature that enhances the security of funds stored on a VerusID. By locking a VerusID with Vault, users can protect their funds from theft, even if their private key is compromised. While the ID is locked, users cannot spend funds from that identity, but they can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. Furthermore, users can still receive funds to the locked ID.\n\nIt's important to note that to enable revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities, users must have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This ensures that users have a secure and reliable way to manage their identities and funds on the Verus network.\n\nOverall, the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, combined with Verus Vault, provides a powerful and secure platform for users to manage their digital identities, store funds, and execute transactions in a decentralized and transparent manner.",
            "## Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.## Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.",
