            "What kind of warranty or liability does the Verus software come with, and what should I know about potential false positive warnings from antivirus software?",
            "The Verus software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that there are no guarantees or warranties about the software's performance, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software.\n\nRegarding antivirus software, some antivirus programs like Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software includes mining capabilities, which could potentially be exploited by third parties to use your computer's resources without your consent. However, these warnings are false positives, and the software is not malicious in nature.\n\nIt's essential to understand that these warnings are not an indication of any malware or virus, but rather a cautionary message about the potential risks associated with mining software. You can find more information about these false positives and how they work by reviewing resources from reputable cybersecurity companies, such as Malwarebytes and Kaspersky.",
