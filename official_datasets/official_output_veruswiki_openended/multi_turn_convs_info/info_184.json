            "What is Verus Vault, and how does it enhance security and protection for funds, IDs, and NFTs on the Verus network?",
            "Verus Vault is a feature on the Verus network that provides an additional layer of security and protection for funds, IDs, and NFTs. With Verus Vault, you can lock your VerusID, which prevents anyone, including the owner, from spending funds associated with that identity until it is unlocked. However, you can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards, and you can also still receive funds.\n\nTo use Verus Vault, you need to have one primary identity and at least one revocation and recovery ID configured. This allows you to set up a system where a revocation and recovery authority identity can revoke and recover a locked VerusID, while preventing unauthorized access to the funds.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Verus Vault is that it provides decentralized protection against common forms of crypto loss or theft, such as the \"5 dollar wrench attack\". This is achieved by setting a time lock, such as a 24-hour unlock delay, which gives the revocation and recovery authority time to detect and respond to any unauthorized unlock attempts.\n\nIn addition to protecting funds, Verus Vault also provides security for IDs and NFTs, and can be used for other purposes such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. Overall, Verus Vault provides a robust and decentralized solution for protecting and recovering funds, IDs, and NFTs on the Verus network.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Verus Vault is not limited to protecting funds on the Verus network. You can also export your ID to a PBaaS chain using the `sendcurrency` command, which allows you to move your protected funds to a PBaaS chain and take advantage of the additional features and security provided by the chain.",
            "### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
