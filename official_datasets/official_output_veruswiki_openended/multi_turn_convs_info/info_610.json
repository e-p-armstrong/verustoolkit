            "To create a daily cloud backup of your Verus wallet.dat file using Google Cloud and encryption for security, you can follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Create a new directory for backups**\nCreate a new directory on your local machine where you will store the backups. For example, you can create a directory called `/home/user/backup`.\n\n**Step 2: Create a storage bucket on Google Cloud**\nCreate a new storage bucket on Google Cloud Console. For example, you can name it `bucket_verus`.\n\n**Step 3: Mount the bucket on your local machine**\nUse the `gcsfuse` command to mount the storage bucket on your local machine. The syntax for this command is `gcsfuse <bucket_name> <local_directory>`. For example, `gcsfuse bucket_verus /home/user/backup`.\n\n**Step 4: Install gnupg2 for encryption**\nInstall `gnupg2` and `gnupg-agent` on your local machine using `sudo apt-get install gnupg2 gnupg-agent`. This will allow you to encrypt your wallet.dat file.\n\n**Step 5: Create a script to backup and encrypt the wallet.dat file**\nCreate a script that will backup the wallet.dat file and encrypt it using `gnupg2`. The script should:\n\n* Customize the source and destination folders\n* Set the source file to `wallet.dat`\n* Set the destination file to `wallet.dat` with the current date and time appended to it\n* Encrypt the destination file using `gpg2` with a customized passphrase\n* Remove the unencrypted destination file\n\nHere is an example script:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nSOURCE_FOLDER=/home/XXXXX/.komodo/VRSC/\nDEST_FOLDER=/home/XXXX/backup/\nBCK_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d.%H:%M)\nSOURCE_FILE=wallet.dat\nDEST_FILE=$SOURCE_FILE\"_\"$BCK_DATE\nENCRYPT_EXT=\".gpg\"\n\n# Customize the passphrase!!\ngpg2 --batch --yes -c --cipher-algo AES256 --passphrase=\"XXXXXX\" $DEST_FOLDER$DEST_FILE\n```\n**Step 6: Schedule the script to run daily (optional)**\nYou can schedule the script to run daily using `crontab`. If you do, you will need to hardcode the encryption passphrase. Alternatively, you can run the script manually and input the passphrase each time.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* Make sure to fully understand what the script does and why before running it.\n* Be sure to keep your wallet.dat file secure, especially if you have timelocked coins.\n* Keep your staking instance and storage secure as well.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a daily cloud backup of your Verus wallet.dat file using Google Cloud and encryption for security.",
            "# How to make a cloud daily backup of wallet.dat?\nNote: I use Google Cloud for my staking wallet and backups but the script works regardless of what you use; if you have timelocked coins, you will have to keep your wallet.dat file secure for a long, long time: it's crucial to maintain secure the staking instance as well as the storage..### Important General Information\n`VRSC Wallet and Data location` on Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC`## Procedure:\nIf you use GCloud:\n* create a new directory where we'll upload the backups (ie: mkdir /home/user/backup)\n* create a storage bucket via GCloud console (ie bucket_verus)\n* mount the bucket on your local machine (syntax is: gcsfuse ; ie gcsfuse bucket_verus /home/user/backup)The script can be crontab scheduled to run daily or you can run it manually; if you schedule it, you have to hardcode the encryption passphrase; otherwise you can input it manually each time. You will have to install gnupg2 to encrypt (`sudo apt-get install gnupg2 gnupg-agent`). As always: be sure to fully understand what the script does and why I left some echos to demonstration/test purposes, you can sefely remove all of them.\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash# Customize the SOURCE and the DEST folders\nSOURCE_FOLDER=/home/XXXXX/.komodo/VRSC/\nDEST_FOLDER=/home/XXXX/backup/BCK_DATE=date +%Y-%m-%d.%H:%MSOURCE_FILE=wallet.dat\nDEST_FILE=$SOURCEFILE\"\"$BCK_DATEENCRYPT_EXT=\".gpg\"# all echo are for test purposes, feel free to delete them\necho check variable\necho SOURCE - $SOURCE_FOLDER\necho SOURCE_FILE - $SOURCE_FILE\necho DEST FILE - $DEST_FILE\necho DEST - $DEST_FOLDER\necho TO_BE_DEL - $DEST_FOLDER$SOURCE_FILEsleep 1cp $SOURCE_FOLDER$SOURCE_FILE $DEST_FOLDER$DEST_FILE\nsleep 1\n# Customize the passphrase!!\ngpg2 --batch --yes -c --cipher-algo AES256 --passphrase=\"XXXXXX\" $DEST_FOLDER$DEST_FILE\nsleep 1\nrm $DEST_FOLDER$DEST_FILE",
