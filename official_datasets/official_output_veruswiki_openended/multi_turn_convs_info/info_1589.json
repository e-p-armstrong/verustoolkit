            "What is the purpose of the `-rpcservertimeout` option in Verus, and how does it affect the behavior of the software?",
            "The `-rpcservertimeout` option in Verus is a configuration parameter that allows users to set a timeout value for HTTP requests made by the Verus software. This option is useful in situations where the default timeout value of 30 seconds is not sufficient, and the user needs to adjust the timeout to accommodate specific network or system requirements.\n\nWhen the `-rpcservertimeout` option is set to a value `<n>`, it specifies the maximum amount of time, in seconds, that Verus will wait for a response to an HTTP request before timing out. This can be useful in scenarios where the network connection is slow or unreliable, or where the remote server is experiencing high latency or heavy load.\n\nBy adjusting the timeout value, users can balance the trade-off between responsiveness and reliability in their Verus setup. A shorter timeout value can help to prevent long delays in case of network issues, while a longer timeout value can provide more time for the request to complete successfully.\n\nIt's worth noting that the `-rpcservertimeout` option is a advanced configuration parameter, and its usage may require a good understanding of the underlying network and system architecture. As such, it's recommended to use this option with caution and only when necessary, as it can affect the overall performance and stability of the Verus software.",
