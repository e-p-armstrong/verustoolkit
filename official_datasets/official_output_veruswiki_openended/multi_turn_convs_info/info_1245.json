            "What are Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault, and how do they contribute to the sustainability and security of the Verus blockchain ecosystem?",
            "Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault are two innovative features of the Verus blockchain ecosystem that contribute to its sustainability and security.\n\n**Verus Fee Pooling Technology:**\nVerus Fee Pooling technology is a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model that addresses the concerns of blockchain security while preserving the incentive to maximize per-block fees. Here's how it works:\n\n* All transaction fees from a block are gathered and added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees.\n* The current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.\n\nThis model smooths fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, ensuring a stable and secure blockchain ecosystem. It also addresses concerns raised by Vitalik Buterin regarding Ethereum's fee model, where the risk of weakening blockchain security due to a lack of incentive for miners and stakers is mitigated.\n\n**Verus Vault:**\nVerus Vault is an advanced time-locking feature for identities that provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management. It enables various use cases, including:\n\n* Trusts\n* Vesting schedules\n* Escrow alternatives\n* Estate planning\n\nVerus Vault, when combined with the revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID, has immense ramifications. It provides a secure and flexible way to manage identities, enabling a wide range of applications and use cases.\n\nIn summary, Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault are two features that contribute to the sustainability and security of the Verus blockchain ecosystem. They provide a stable and secure fee model, while also enabling advanced identity management capabilities that support various use cases.",
            "- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
