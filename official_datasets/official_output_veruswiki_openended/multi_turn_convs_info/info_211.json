            "What are the requirements to launch a new currency on the Verus network, and how can I convert my VRSCTEST to the new currency? Additionally, how can I create a new currency that can be converted to with either the new currency or VRSCTEST?",
            "To launch a new currency on the Verus network, the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate the launch. The launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction was made (default), and it must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specified rate (e.g. 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch. The launch process is part of the mining process, and mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new currency.\n\nTo convert VRSCTEST to the new currency, you can use the `sendcurrency` command before the block where the new currency launches. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of the new currency in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.\n\nAfter the new currency launches, you can create a new currency that can be converted to with either the new currency or VRSCTEST. To do this, you can define the new currency using the `definecurrency` command, specifying the properties of the new currency, such as its name, options, currencies, and initial supply. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis defines a new currency named \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either VRSCTEST or GOLD.",
            "urrency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
