            "How do I send and convert currencies between Verus and a PBaaS reserve chain using the `sendreserve` command?",
            "The `sendreserve` command is used to send and convert currencies between Verus and a PBaaS reserve chain. There are several ways to use this command, depending on the direction of the transfer and whether you want to convert the currency.\n\n**Sending unconverted VRSCTEST to a PBaaS reserve chain:**\nTo send unconverted VRSCTEST to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000}'\n```\nThis will send 5000 VRSCTEST to the specified address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain, where it can be converted to the native currency of that chain later.\n\n**Sending reserve to another chain and converting to native currency:**\nTo send reserve currency to another chain and convert it to the native currency of that chain at the current market price, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```\nThis will send 5000 reserve currency to the specified address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain and convert it to the native currency of that chain.\n\n**Sending reserve currency to a PBaaS reserve chain:**\nTo send reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain without converting it, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{\"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000}'\n```\nThis will send 5000 reserve currency to the specified address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain, where it can be used as is.\n\n**Sending native currency to a PBaaS reserve chain and converting to reserve currency:**\nTo send native currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and convert it to reserve currency at the current market price, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{\"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"toreserve\": 1}'\n```\nThis will send 5000 native currency to the specified address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain and convert it to reserve currency.\n\n**Sending reserve currency to a PBaaS reserve chain and converting to native currency:**\nTo send reserve currency to an address on a PBaaS reserve chain and convert it to native currency at the current market price, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE sendreserve '{\"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```\nThis will send 5000 reserve currency to the specified address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain and convert it to native currency.",
            "**Sending unconverted VRSCTEST to an address on the RESERVEWITHPREMINE chain for later conversion to/from the native coin.**\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000}'\n```**Sending reserve to another chain and converting a coin from reserve to that chain's native currency at the current market price.**\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"tonative\": 1}'\n```**Sending reserve currency to an address on the current PBaaS reserve chain with no cross-chain operation, Reserve currency on a PBaaS chain is equivalent to and convertible between the native VRSCTEST currency, but may also be sent to and used on PBaaS reserve chains.
