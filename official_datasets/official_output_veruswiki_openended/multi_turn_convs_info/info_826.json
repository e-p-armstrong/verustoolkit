            "How do I configure my Verus miner to connect to a mining pool and start mining VerusCoin to my own address?",
            "To configure your Verus miner to connect to a mining pool and start mining VerusCoin to your own address, you need to follow these steps:\n\nFirst, you need to edit the `start.sh` file to configure the miner's settings. To do this, open the `start.sh` file with a text editor, such as `TextEdit.app`.\n\nNext, you need to update the following settings:\n\n1. **Pool Host**: Update the `PoolHost=` line to point to the URL of the mining pool you want to use. For example, if you're using the VerusCoin community pool, you would set `Poolhost=pool.verus.io`.\n2. **Port**: Update the `Port=` line to specify the port number used by the mining pool. For example, if the pool uses port 9999, you would set `Port=9999`.\n3. **Public VerusCoin Address**: Update the `PublicVerusCoinAddress=` line to specify the VerusCoin address that you want to mine to. **Make sure to use your own address!**\n4. **Worker Name**: Update the `WorkerName=` line to specify a name for your mining system. This can be any name you want to identify your system.\n\nAfter updating these settings, you need to configure the number of processor threads that the miner will use. **Make sure to use less threads than your processor has virtual cores**, otherwise your system may become sluggish or unresponsive.\n\nOnce you've updated these settings, save and exit the file.\n\nNext, you need to make the `start.sh` file executable. To do this, create a copy of the file and rename it to `start.command`. This will create an executable file that you can run by double-clicking on it.\n\nFinally, double-click on the `start.command` file to start the miner. Your machine will now start mining VerusCoin to your specified address.",
            "Now we need to configure things so the miner connects to a mining pool (listed on the download page, below the miner download) and mines to your address. In the instructions below I will use the VerusCoin community pool and the address for the Veruscoin foundation. make sure to use your own address and if desired the details of a different pool:\n 5. click `start.sh` and open with `TextEdit.app`\n 6. On the 2nd line, change `PoolHost=` into `Poolhost=pool.verus.io`\n 7. On the 3rd line, change `Port=` into 'Port=9999'\n 8. On the 4th line, change 'PublicVerusCoinAddress=' into `PublicVerusCoinAddress=RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ`\n    (make sure you use your own address!!!!)\n 9. On the 5th line, change `WorkerName=` into `WorkerName=MacOS` (or any name you want to identify your system)\n\nIn the next step we will set how many processor threads the miner will use. Make sure to use less threads than your processor has virtual cores. If you allow the miner to use all cores, your system will become sluggish at times, or it may even become completely unresponsive:\n 10) On the 6th line, change `Threads=` into `Threads=7` (fill in the amount of virtual cores you want to use)\n 11) Save and exit the file.\n\nWe have all the settings ready to go, but the file we just edited is not executable right now.\n 12. Click `Start.sh` and click `copy \"Start.sh\"`\n 13. Click in an empty space in you folder and click `Paste items`, which will result in a new `start copy.sh` file.\n 14. rename `start copy.sh` to `start.command`\nNow we have an executable file that will run when you doubleclick.\n 15. Doubleclick `start.command` and your machine will start mining.\n\nCreated by Oink.vrsc@.\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-02-26.",
