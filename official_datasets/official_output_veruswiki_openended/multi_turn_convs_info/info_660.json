            "How do I run a Verus miner with low priority, and what are the essential components of the command I need to use?",
            "To run a Verus miner with low priority, you need to use the `nice` command along with the command to run your miner. This is done to prevent the miner from consuming too many system resources and slowing down your system.\n\nHere's the general format of the command:\n```\nnice -n 19./ccminer -a verus -o <pool_url> -u <your_verus_address>.<miner_identifier> -t <number_of_threads>\n```\nLet's break down the essential components of this command:\n\n* `nice -n 19` is used to run the command with low priority. The `-n 19` option sets the priority of the process to 19, which is a low priority.\n* `./ccminer` is the command to run the miner. You may need to replace this with the actual command to run your miner, depending on the miner software you are using.\n* `-a verus` specifies the algorithm to use for mining, which in this case is Verus.\n* `-o <pool_url>` specifies the URL of the mining pool you want to connect to. Replace `<pool_url>` with the actual URL of your preferred mining pool.\n* `-u <your_verus_address>.<miner_identifier>` specifies your Verus address and a miner identifier. Replace `<your_verus_address>` with your actual Verus address, and `<miner_identifier>` with a name that easily identifies the miner to you.\n* `-t <number_of_threads>` specifies the number of threads to use for mining. Replace `<number_of_threads>` with the actual number of threads you want to use.\n\nRemember to replace the placeholders with your actual values, and adjust the command according to your miner software and preferences.",
            "- Run your miner as you normally would, with `nice -n 19 ` placed in front of the command you normally use,\n  for example:\n   `nice -n 19 ./ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -t 6`\n - make sure you replace the pool (`stratum+tcp://pool.verus.io:9999`) with your prefered pool and the address\n  (`RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ`) with your own address. The address shown in this line is the veruscoin\n  foundation donation address. If desired change the identifier (`Donator`) to a name that easily identifies the\n  miner to you.\n\nCreated by Oink.vrsc@.\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-11-11.",
