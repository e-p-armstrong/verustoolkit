            "How do I import multiple WIFs in one batch for public (transparent) addresses, and how do I import a single WIF for a private address, in Verus?",
            "To import multiple WIFs in one batch for public (transparent) addresses in Verus, you need to follow a specific procedure. First, go to the `settings` section of your Verus wallet and select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner. Then, for every WIF except the final one, enter the following command:\n```\nrun importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" false\n```\nReplace `<wif>` with the actual WIF you obtained from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier.\n\nFor the final WIF, use the following command:\n```\nrun importprivkey \"<wif>\" \"\" true\n```\nThis last command triggers the chain to rescan all addresses in your wallet, including all the addresses you just imported.\n\nNote that the GUI wallet may not show any progress on the import and may give messages that the RPC daemon is not reacting. This process may take some time to finish in the background, especially if the address has many transactions on it.\n\nOn the other hand, to import a single WIF for a private address, you can use the following command:\n```\nrun z_importkey \"<wif>\" \"yes\" 1\n```\nAgain, replace `<wif>` with the actual WIF you obtained from the `convertpassphrase` command earlier.\n\nRemember to be patient, as the import process may take some time to complete, especially if the address has many transactions.",
