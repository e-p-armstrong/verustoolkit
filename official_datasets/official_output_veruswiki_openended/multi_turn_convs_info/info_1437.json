            "How can I use the Verus `sendcurrency` command to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token, and what happens when the token launches? Additionally, how can I create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST?",
            "Using the Verus `sendcurrency` command, you can park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches. This is done by specifying the address, conversion details, and amount of VRSCTEST you want to convert. The format for this command is:\n\n```\nST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"convertto\":\"new_token\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command effectively parks your conversion until the new token launches. When the token launches, you will either find the converted amount of the new token in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nFor example, if you parked a conversion of 100 VRSCTEST to GOLD, you would either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you would have your 100 VRSCTEST back.\n\nAfter the new token launches, you can create a new token, let's call it `mycoin`, that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST. To do this, you would use the `definecurrency` command, specifying the properties of `mycoin`, such as its name, options, proof protocol, currencies it can be converted to, and initial supply.\n\nHere's an example of how you would create `mycoin`:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\", \"GOLD\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\n\nIn this example, `mycoin` can be converted to with either VRSCTEST or GOLD, and its proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID, allowing the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins.",
            "ST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
