            "How does Verus Vault provide a decentralized solution to protect and recover funds, IDs, and NFTs, and what are some of the use cases for its features?",
            "Verus Vault is a powerful feature that provides a decentralized solution to protect and recover funds, IDs, and NFTs. It achieves this through the use of locked VerusIDs, which can be revoked and recovered by their revocation and recovery authority identities. This means that even if an unauthorized user gains access to the primary keys, they will not be able to spend or access funds immediately, as they will need to wait for a predetermined unlock time.\n\nThis feature provides a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, making it the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5-dollar wrench attack. By setting a delay on the unlock time, users can ensure that they have time to respond to unauthorized activity and prevent losses.\n\nVerus Vault also provides the same security for IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This means that users can protect and recover their funds, preserving all their assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, without relying on a bank.\n\nIn addition, Verus Vault allows for the exporting of IDs to PBaaS chains, which can be done using the `sendcurrency` command. This command enables users to export their IDs to a PBaaS chain, where they can be used for various purposes, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or other use cases.\n\nOverall, Verus Vault provides a powerful and decentralized solution for protecting and recovering funds, IDs, and NFTs, and its features have a wide range of use cases, from preventing crypto loss and theft to enabling decentralized finance applications.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
