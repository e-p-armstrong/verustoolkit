            "What are the new features and improvements introduced in a recent Verus release, and how do they enhance the functionality of the mainnet and testnet?",
            "A recent Verus release has introduced several new features and improvements to both the mainnet and testnet. These updates aim to enhance the functionality, security, and usability of the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**Mainnet Improvements:**\n\n1. **Auto TLS Encrypted Connections**: Nodes on the mainnet and testnet now automatically establish TLS-encrypted connections, ensuring secure communication between nodes. Users can opt to require all connections to be encrypted by starting the daemon with the \"-tlsenforcement\" flag.\n2. **ID Index and API Enhancements**: A new \"-idindex\" flag enables three new APIs: `getidentitywithaddress`, `getidentitywithrevocation`, and `getidentitywithrecovery`. These APIs allow for lookup of identities by their primary addresses or revocation and recovery addresses, making it easier to develop applications that graph or display public relationships between identities, transparent addresses, and transactions.\n3. **Multithreading Improvements**: The daemon's multithreading has been optimized, enabling better performance and efficiency.\n\n**Testnet (PBaaS) Features:**\n\nIn addition to the mainnet improvements, the testnet has introduced several new features as part of the PBaaS protocol:\n\n1. **NFT Mapped Tokens and Tokenized ID Control**: Users can now create a new type of currency using any type of ID or sub-ID. This currency, called tokenized ID control, has a fixed supply of 1 Satoshi and grants the holder power over the ID that issued it. This feature enables the creation of super NFTs that can be used across multiple chains.\n2. **Ethereum Mapped Currencies**: Root identities can be used to create any kind of currency, while *.veth IDs can be used to create Ethereum-mapped currencies.\n\nThese updates demonstrate Verus' commitment to enhancing the security, functionality, and usability of its ecosystem, paving the way for more innovative applications and use cases.",
            "This release fixes a mainnet issue that may, in rare cases, cause a node to deadlock.\nIt also adds the following new features to mainnet:\n- Auto TLS encrypted connections between nodes on mainnet and testnet, no action needed, but you can require that all connections be encrypted by starting the daemon with \u201c-tlsenforcement\u201d.\n- A new \u201c-idindex\u201d flag that enables 3 new APIs to lookup identities by their primary addresses or revocation and recovery addresses, `getidentitywithaddress`, `getidentitywithrevocation`, and `getidentitywithrecovery`.\n Generally improved multithreading within the daemon.\n- These improvements allow anyone to now write applications to easily graph or display public relationships between identities, transparent addresses, and transactions without compromising the privacy of private addresses, messages, or transactions between identities using name@:private endpoints, z-addresses or communicating via off-chain channels.For testnet, this is RC2 of the PBaaS protocol and has some significant and important advances and changes. In addition to a great deal of progress hardening for mainnet, v0.9.4 introduces the following new features to the PBaaS testnet:\n- All features above for mainnet\n- NFT mapped tokens and tokenized ID control - In v0.9.4, as with v0.9.3, you can use root identities to create any kind of currencies, *.veth IDs to create Ethereum mapped currencies, and what is new in v0.9.4 is that you can now use any type of ID or sub-ID to create a new kind of currency that will always have a 1 Satoshi supply and enable anyone holding it to have power over the ID that issued it. This type of currency is called tokenized ID control and can be treated like a super NFT over all copies of the source ID on all chains that were exported to other chains after the currency was created. Once the Ethereum contracts are upgraded with this capability, *.ve",
