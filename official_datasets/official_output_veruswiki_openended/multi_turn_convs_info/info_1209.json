            "What are some features of the Verus protocol that enable advanced functionality for users, such as querying for arbitrage opportunities and enhancing VerusIDs with advanced time lock capabilities?",
            "The Verus protocol offers several features that enable advanced functionality for users. Two such features are system-wide queries for fractional basket currencies and enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology.\n\n**System-wide Queries for Fractional Basket Currencies:**\nThe Verus protocol provides an RPC API that allows users to query the entire blockchain network for fractional basket currencies that meet specific criteria. This API, called `getcurrencyconverters`, enables users to search for currencies that contain one or more reserve currencies and have a liquidity threshold above a certain level. This feature allows users to easily discover investment opportunities, find the best conversion rates, and even engage in arbitrage to earn a profit.\n\n**Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault Technology:**\nVerusIDs, which are the blockchain addresses and identities used on the Verus protocol, have been enhanced with Verus Vault technology. This technology adds an advanced time lock capability to VerusIDs, allowing users to implement features such as vesting, trusts, and protocols for theft-proofing funds. The time lock capability does not prevent staking on locked funds, ensuring that users can still earn rewards while keeping their funds secure. With Verus Vault technology, users can manage their funds, identity, and estate planning in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind that comes from knowing their assets are protected from lost or stolen private keys.\n\nThese features, among others, make the Verus protocol a powerful tool for users seeking advanced functionality and security in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency.",
            "- **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting** - The new RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters` (final name at mainnet, TBD), enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This new API enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide, or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.- **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology** - This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability that does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, your funds, identity, and estate planning can be done in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing you are protected from lost or stolen private keys.",
