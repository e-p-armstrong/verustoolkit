            "What should I do if I encounter an error message saying \"Cannot Get a lock on data directory /root/.komodo/VRSC\" when trying to start Verus, and how can I check if Verus is already running?",
            "If you encounter the error message \"Cannot Get a lock on data directory /root/.komodo/VRSC\" when trying to start Verus, it likely means that Verus is already running. To resolve this issue, you need to check if Verus is indeed running.\n\nTo do this, you can use the `getinfo` command. Open a terminal and run:\n\n```\n./verus getinfo\n```\n\nIf Verus is running, you will receive information about the current state of the node. If Verus is not running, you will get an error message.\n\nIf the `getinfo` command throws an error, you can further investigate by checking if any Verus processes are running in the background. To do this, run:\n\n```\nps fax | grep verus\n```\n\nThis command will list all processes that match the name \"verus\". If Verus is running, you should see a process listed with the name \"verusd\" and its associated child processes, including the Komodo process with its command-line arguments.\n\nBy following these steps, you can determine if Verus is already running and troubleshoot the issue preventing you from starting the node.",
            "# ERROR: Cannot Get a lock on data directory /root/.komodo/VRSC.\n\nKomodo is probably already running.\n\n## Procedure:\n\nIt just means you can't start it when it's already running. If it isn't running we can take a look at it.\nCheck to see if it is running by running:\n\n`./verus getinfo`\n\nIf it's running you'll get info back, if it isn't you'll get an error.\nIf that throws an error, it's worth checking using this command:\n\n`ps fax | grep verus`\n\nand seeing if any processes are listed besides the process you're using to search.\nYou would see verusd with a child process of komodo and all its cli arguments.\n\n(submitted by @keda666, solution written by englal.vrsc@)\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-02-26.",
