            "What are some limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency on Verus, and what should I do if I've updated from a previous version?",
            "When working with multi-currency on Verus, there are a few limitations to be aware of:\n\n**Limitation 1: ID Names and i-Addresses**\nIn both the GUI and CLI, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because an i-address, when used, will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. It's generally advised to avoid creating IDs with i-addresses as their names, as this can cause problems in various situations. To prevent user confusion, the naming system will also expand the set of characters that are not allowed for currency registrations.\n\n**Limitation 2: GUI and Existing Currency Names**\nIn the GUI, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you cannot use those same names for a PBaaS chain. However, this limitation is considered errata and will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\n**Testnet Reset and Update**\nIf you've updated from a previous version, you'll need to delete certain directories before running the new update. This is because the testnet was deleted and relaunched. To ensure a smooth transition, please delete the following directories:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nBy being aware of these limitations and taking the necessary steps after an update, you can ensure a smooth and successful experience with multi-currency on Verus.",
            "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/vrsctest\n```**MacOS**\n```\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest\n```**Windows**\n```\n\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST\n```# Disclaimer",
