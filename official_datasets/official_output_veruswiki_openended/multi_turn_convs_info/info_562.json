            "What are some of the most useful Verus CLI commands, and how do I properly format them for use on different operating systems?",
            "Verus provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Verus network. Here are some of the most commonly used Verus CLI commands, along with notes on how to format them for use on different operating systems.\n\n**General Remarks:**\n\n* When using the Verus CLI, you need to enter the commands literally, replacing `<userinput>` with your specific user data. For example, if a command asks for a public address, you would replace `<Public Address>` with the actual address, such as `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`.\n* On Windows, enter the commands without surrounding quotation marks.\n* On Linux and MacOS, precede the commands with `./` (e.g., `./verus listtransactions`).\n\n**Handy Verus CLI Commands:**\n\n* **Getting a new Public address:** `verus getnewaddress`\n* **Listing your available public addresses:** `verus listaddressgroupings`\n* **Getting a new Private address:** `verus z_getnewaddress`\n* **Listing your available private addresses:** `verus z_listaddresses`\n* **Importing a VRSC private key of a R-address into your wallet:** `verus importprivkey \"<PRIVATE_KEY>\"`\n* **Importing a VRSC private key of a z-address into your wallet:** `verus z_importkey \"<PRIVATE_KEY>\"`\n* **Getting your current VRSC balance:** `verus getbalance` or `verus z_gettotalbalance` for more information\n* **Getting the balance of a specific address:** `verus z_getbalance \"<z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>\"`\n\n**Formatting Notes for Windows:**\n\n* When using the Windows command line, substitute the shown `-` character with the `\\\"` character.\n* When using the Windows command line, substitute the shown `-` character with the `-` character.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using these handy Verus CLI commands, you'll be able to effectively interact with the Verus network and manage your VRSC assets.",
            "# Useful Verus CLI commands.\nNote: This list is by no means complete, it highlites only the most commonly used commands.
