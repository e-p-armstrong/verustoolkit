            "What should I be aware of when installing and using Verus mining software, and how do I define and connect to a PBaaS chain?",
            "When installing Verus mining software, you may encounter warnings from antivirus software such as Avast and Kaspersky, flagging the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). These warnings are simply alerts that you are installing mining software, which could potentially be used by a third party to exploit your PC. You can learn more about these false positives by reviewing the resources provided.\n\nRegarding the use of Verus, please note that this is a test release intended for use with test chains, and it is not recommended for use with mainnet.\n\nTo define a PBaaS chain, you can use the `definechain` command. Here is an example of how to define a chain named \"SOMECOIN\":\n```\n./komodo-cli -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [{\"reward\" : 10000000000}], \"notarizationreward\" : 1440000000, \"billingperiod\" : 1440, \"nodes\" : [{\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2500\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"\"}, {\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2501\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"RDyDzC5JB66Y29fzBkamywqEn1PJXTzj8B\"}]}'\n```\nWhen defining a chain, please note that there are some minimum requirements:\n\n* A maximum of 3 eras\n* A minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations\n* A minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization\n* You will need VRSCTEST in your wallet to create a chain\n\nOnce a chain is created, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to the defined chain using the command:\n```\n./komodod -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\nOn the first connection, a local config file will be created, and VRSCTEST will not be needed to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine. The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME` directory, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.",
