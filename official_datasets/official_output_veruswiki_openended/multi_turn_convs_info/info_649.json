            "How does the VerusPay plugin for WooCommerce on WordPress enable cryptocurrency payments in Verus Coin (VRSC), and what are the security measures in place to protect user data?",
            "The VerusPay plugin for WooCommerce on WordPress is a plugin that allows online stores to accept Verus Coin (VRSC) as a form of payment. When a customer places an order using VerusPay, the order is held pending payment confirmation. The customer has a limited time to send the payment, and the store's VerusPay plugin monitors the wallet or address to confirm receipt of payment. Once payment is confirmed, the order is released, and the customer is redirected to the Thank You page.\n\nThe plugin can operate in two modes: on-store wallet daemon mode (recommended for VPS or dedicated hosting stores) and manual mode (recommended for shared hosting stores). In manual mode, the plugin uses limited API functionality to communicate with the blockchain explorer to verify payments and with the veruspay.io API to retrieve up-to-date price data. This ensures that no private data about the store owner, store, or customer is sent to the APIs. The only data sent to the blockchain explorer API is the public, transparent blockchain transaction and address used. For veruspay.io API price data, only the store-set currency is sent to retrieve the current fiat exchange rate for Verus Coin.\n\nThe security measures in place to protect user data include:\n\n1. Limited API functionality: The plugin only uses the necessary API functionality to verify payments and retrieve price data, minimizing the amount of data sent to the APIs.\n2. No private data sent: The plugin does not send any private data about the store owner, store, or customer to the APIs.\n3. Public, transparent blockchain data: The only data sent to the blockchain explorer API is the public, transparent blockchain transaction and address used.\n4. Secure communication: The plugin communicates with the APIs using a secure connection to protect user data.\n\nOverall, the VerusPay plugin provides a secure and convenient way for online stores to accept Verus Coin as a form of payment, while protecting user data and ensuring the integrity of the payment process.",
            "This plugin extends *WooCommerce* on *Wordpress*, adding the ability to accept cryptocurrency payments in Verus Coin (VRSC) using either an on-store wallet daemon (best for VPS or dedicated hosting stores) or manually configured VRSC addresses (best for shared hosting stores).When an order is submitted via the VerusPay gateway, the order will be placed \"on-hold\" while awaiting payment from the customer. The customer has a limited time wherein to send the payment and the store monitors the wallet/address to confirm payment received before releasing the order and redirecting the customer to the Thank You page.VerusPay uses limited API functionality for Manual Mode, to communicate with the blockchain explorer in verifying payments and with the veruspay.io API to get up-to-date price data. These API's do not receive any private data either about the store owner, store, or customer. The only data sent to the block explorer API is the public/transparent blockchain transaction and address used. For VerusPay.io API price data, only the store-set currency is sent to retrieve the current fiat exchange rate for Verus Coin.[*VerusPay installation instructions*](https://github.com/monkins1010/VerusPay/wiki)## Be a part of it allFocus on Verus\u2019 social media presence has picked up with new, fresh looking Facebook and YouTube channels so check them out and feel free to post something or simply explore the content.
