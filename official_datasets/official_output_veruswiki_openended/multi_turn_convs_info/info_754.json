            "How do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, create a tokenized ID control (next-generation NFT), and create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent using the Verus command line interface?",
            "Here are the steps to accomplish these tasks:\n\n**Signing Transactions from Multi-Signature IDs:**\n\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a transaction:** Use the `verus sendcurrency` command to create a transaction from a multi-signature ID. For example:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\nThis will return an operation ID.\n\n2. **Get the raw transaction data:** Use the `verus z_getoperationstatus` command with the operation ID to get the raw transaction data. For example:\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\nThis will return the raw hex transaction data.\n\n3. **Sign the transaction:** Take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using the `verus signrawtransaction` command. For example:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n4. **Broadcast the signed transaction:** After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using the `verus sendrawtransaction` command. For example:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\n\n**Tokenizing ID Control (Next-Generation NFT):**\n\nTo create a tokenized ID control, also known as a next-generation NFT, you need to define a currency with specific options. Here's an example:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```\nThis defines a currency with the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN` flags, a max supply of 1 satoshi, and a pre-allocation to `ControlTokenRecipient@`.\n\n**Creating an Identity with a Fractional Currency as its Parent:**\n\nTo create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent, you need to use the `registernamecommitment` command with additional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Here's an example:\n```\nregisternamecommitment <name> <commitment> <currency_parent> <funding_address>\n```\nYou can leave fields blank by using quotes `\"\"`. For example, to specify a parent currency `vrsc-btc` but no referrer, you can use:\n```\nregisternamecommitment <name> <commitment> \"vrsc-btc\" \"\"\n```\nYou can use `z_addresses` to fund the name commitment and identity registration.",
            "## Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)\nCreate transaction, get raw transaction data:\n ```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\nTake the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:\n ```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:\n ```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```## Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):\nThe currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```## Creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent\n`registernamecommitment` now takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. Use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration",
