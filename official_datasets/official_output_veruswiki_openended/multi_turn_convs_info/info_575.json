            "When using the Verus CLI, it's essential to format commands correctly to ensure they are executed successfully. The formatting may vary depending on the operating system you're using.\n\n**General Information:**\nWhen using the Verus CLI, you need to replace `<userinput>` with your specific userdata, such as public addresses or amounts. Replace the entire `<userinput>` text, including the angle brackets, with your actual data.\n\n**Linux and MacOS:**\nThe command format for Linux and MacOS is shown in the CLI help. You can use the commands as they are, replacing `<userinput>` with your data.\n\n**Windows Command Line Formatting:**\nWhen using the native Windows command prompt (`cmd.com`), you need to make the following adjustments:\n\n1. Replace the shown `'` character with the `\"` character.\n2. Replace the shown `\"` character with the `\\\"` characters.\n3. Omit the preceding `./` from the command.\n\nHere's an example of how to format a command on Windows:\n```\nverus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> \"[{\\\"address\\\":\\\"<my_transparent_address>\\\",\\\"amount\\\":<95.9998>}]\"\n```\nBy following these formatting guidelines, you can ensure that your Verus CLI commands are executed correctly on your chosen operating system.",
            "# Question: How do I unshield my coin rewards and get them staking on CLI?### Important General Information`verus command \"<userinput>\"` needs to be entered literally, with `<userinput>` replaced by your specific userdata. So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address,\nso it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`.#### Remarks on Windows command line formatting:The CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS. On the native windows command prompt (`cmd.com`) the formatting is different.\n* In windows command prompt, substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character.\n* In windows command prompt, substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters.\n* In windows command prompt, omit the preceding `./`.Note: As an example, in Linux the command:\n`./verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> '[{\"address\":\"<my_transparent_address>\",\"amount\":<95.9998>}]'`\nshould be entered on the Windows command prompt as:\n`verus z_sendmany <my_private_address_without_quotationmarks> \"[{\\\"address\\\":\\\"<my_transparent_address>\\\",\\\"amount\\\":<95.9998>}]\"`",
