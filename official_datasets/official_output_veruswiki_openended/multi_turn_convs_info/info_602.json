            "What are the key characteristics of a VerusID, and how do they provide control, security, and flexibility for identity management?",
            "A VerusID is a robust and feature-rich digital identity system that offers several key characteristics, including revocability, recoverability, privacy, and power.\n\n**Revocability:** Each VerusID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity itself. This means that if an ID is compromised, the revocation authority can be used to revoke the identity, effectively freezing its funds and preventing it from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered. This feature is useful in cases of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n**Recoverability:** In addition to revocability, each VerusID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to the identity itself. If an ID is revoked, the recovery authority can be used to recover the ID, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign. This feature provides an additional layer of security and control.\n\n**Privacy:** VerusIDs are designed with privacy in mind. Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, which can be used to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations. This feature enables users to control what information is shared and with whom.\n\n**Power:** VerusIDs are also highly flexible and powerful. Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). This feature enables users to create complex, multi-sig wallet arrangements that require multiple parties to agree before a transaction is authorized. Furthermore, the revocation and recovery authorities may only be altered by themselves, adding an additional layer of security and control.\n\nOverall, VerusIDs provide a robust and flexible system for identity management, offering a range of features that enable users to control, secure, and manage their digital identities with confidence.",
            "* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of M multisig controls for its primary addresses.",
