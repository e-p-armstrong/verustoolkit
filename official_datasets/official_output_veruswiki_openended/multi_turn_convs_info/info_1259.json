            "How do I define a new currency on the Verus blockchain, and what are the implications of setting the proof protocol to PROOF_CHAINID? Additionally, what steps should I take to reset the testnet?",
            "To define a new currency on the Verus blockchain, you can use the `definecurrency` command. For example, to define a new currency called \"mycoin\", you would use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\n\nIn this command, we're defining a new currency with the name \"mycoin\", and setting its options to 97. We're also setting the proof protocol to 2, which corresponds to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID will have the ability to mint new coins.\n\nWhen the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID, the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins using the `sendcurrency` command. For example, to mint 10,000 new \"mycoin\" coins and send them to the address \"mike@\", you would use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n\nTo reset the testnet, you'll need to delete the following directories:\n\n**On Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/VRSCTEST\n~/.verustest\n```\n\nDeleting these directories will allow you to start the testnet from a clean slate.",
            "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n## Testnet Reset Instructions\n**Please delete the following directories before launching the testnet:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/VRSCTEST\n~/.verustest\n```",
