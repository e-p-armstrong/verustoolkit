            "What is the Decentralized Ethereum Bridge and how does it work?",
            "The Decentralized Ethereum Bridge is a gateway that will soon be launched on the Verus network, allowing for seamless interaction between the Verus and Ethereum networks. This bridge will introduce a new currency called \"vETH\" which is a 1:1 provably mapped currency on the Verus network, available to all PBaaS chains.\n\nThe Ethereum bridge will have several key features:\n\n**Liquidity Basket:** The bridge will include a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI. This basket will be used for auto-conversion of fees when sending cross-chain transactions between Verus and Ethereum, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket.\n\n**Mapped Currencies:** The bridge will allow for the permissionless registration of *.vETH IDs, which can be used to create a \"mapped currency\" that can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network. This means that users will be able to create a token on the Verus network that is equivalent to an ERC20 token on Ethereum. Only Verus root IDs and IDs of a gateway can create mapped currencies to a gateway.\n\n**Decentralized Launch:** The vETH bridge will launch in a decentralized and fair manner, similar to the launch of other currencies, chains, and gateways on the Verus network. The contracts will have a surplus of Verus from the fees paid to launch the gateway, which will be used to cover the Verus fees for all sends from Ethereum before the Bridge converter launches.\n\n**Contract Surplus:** The remaining surplus of fees (5000 VRSC) will be used to launch the Bridge converter and activate the liquidity basket. This will solve the \"chicken and egg\" problem of having none of one currency on the other chain, allowing for seamless interaction between the two networks.\n\nOverall, the Decentralized Ethereum Bridge will provide a powerful and decentralized gateway between the Verus and Ethereum networks, enabling new use cases and possibilities for users of both networks.",
            "5) **Decentralized Ethereum Bridge**: Shortly after PBaaS activates on mainnet, the Ethereum bridge will launch as a decentralized gateway and 1:1 provably mapped currency called \u201cvETH\u201d on the Verus network, also available to all PBaaS chains. The Ethereum bridge will also include a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI, which will have the following functions:\nAuto conversion of fees from Verus <-> Ethereum when sending cross chain, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket\nPermissionless ability to register *.vETH IDs, which in addition to the normal sub-ID capability of creating a single token that has control over the ID and can be exported to Ethereum as an automatic ERC721 NFT, can alternately be used to create a \u201cmapped currency\u201d, which can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network by exporting it to the vETH bridge. Only Verus root IDs, and IDs of a gateway can create mapped currencies to a gateway.\nDecentralized, fair bridge launch. The vETH bridge will launch as other currencies, chains, and gateways can launch, including the bridge converter. When the bridge launches, the contracts will have a surplus of Verus that comes from the fees paid to launch the gateway. In the protocol, that surplus is first used to solve the chicken and egg problem of none of one currency on the other chain. The contracts will cover the Verus fees for all sends from Ethereum before the Bridge converter launches, the liquidity basket becomes active, and the bridge recognizes that launch. Once that happens, the remainder of \u00bd the fees (5000 VRSC) that are left over from the launch and did not go to miners and stakers or pay Verus fees for people sending from Ethereum",
