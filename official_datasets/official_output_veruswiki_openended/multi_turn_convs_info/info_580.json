            "What is the significance of Verus version 0.9.9, especially in relation to the test network and cross-chain operations?",
            "Verus version 0.9.9 is an upgrade that resolves all known issues on the test network, allowing users to fully sync and resume cross-chain operations smoothly. This upgrade is particularly important because it addresses problems that were causing difficulties on the test network, including the inability to perform cross-chain operations and sync with the network.\n\nOne specific issue that this upgrade fixes is related to an intermediate version of the Verus daemon that was used on the test network, which made the network unavailable without a bootstrap on the older daemon. This upgrade resolves this issue, ensuring that the network is accessible and functional.\n\nAdditionally, this upgrade enables auto-notarization on the test network, which will be activated when the testfork is executed. Until then, witnessed cross-chain operations can resume, provided they were experiencing difficulties.\n\nIn general, this upgrade demonstrates Verus' commitment to ensuring the stability and reliability of its network, especially on the test network, where developers and users can experiment and test new features and functionality. By resolving these issues, Verus is taking a significant step towards a more robust and efficient network, which will ultimately benefit its users.",
            "3. **This upgrade fixes all known testnet issues with no reset**: Using v0.9.9, you should be able to sync fully and resume all cross-chain operations on the Verus test network, if you were not able to perform cross-chain operations or sync to the network on the prior version. As mentioned, someone seems to have mined with an intermediate version along the way on testnet and made the network unavailable without a bootstrap on the older daemon. This version should fix that issue as well as any cross-chain difficulties. Auto-notarization will be enabled on testnet in sync when the testfork executes. Until then, all witnessed cross-chain operations should be able to resume, if they have had difficulty. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**",
