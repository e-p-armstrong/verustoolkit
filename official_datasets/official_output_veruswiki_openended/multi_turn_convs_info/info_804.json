            "What are the different options available when defining a currency in Verus, and what do each of these options do?",
            "When defining a currency in Verus, there are several options that can be set to customize the behavior of the currency. These options are represented as integers and can be combined to achieve the desired behavior. Here's what each of these options does:\n\n**OPTION_FRACTIONAL (1):** This option allows for reserve conversion using base calculations. When set, it enables fractional reserve conversion.\n\n**OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE (2):** This option controls who can create IDs on the chain. If set, only the controlling ID can create new IDs, otherwise, ID creation is permissionless.\n\n**OPTION_ID_STAKING (4):** This option determines how staking works on the chain. If set, all IDs on the chain stake equally, regardless of their value. If not set, staking is value-based.\n\n**OPTION_ID_REFERRALS (8):** This option enables referrals on the chain. When set, the chain supports referrals.\n\n**OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED (16):** This option makes referrals mandatory on the chain. If set, referrals are required to create new IDs.\n\n**OPTION_TOKEN (32):** This option specifies whether the currency is a token or a native currency. If set, the currency is a token.\n\n**OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY (64):** This option restricts the chain to a single currency. It is typically used for PBaaS chains or gateways.\n\n**OPTION_GATEWAY (128):** This option specifies that the currency is a gateway that routes external currencies.\n\n**OPTION_PBAAS (256):** This option defines the currency as a PBaaS chain.\n\n**OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER (512):** This option specifies that the currency is the default converter for a PBaaS gateway and will publish prices.\n\n**OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER (1024):** This option controls who can register top-level IDs and currencies on the launch chain. If not set on a gateway, registration happens on the launch chain.\n\n**OPTION_NFT_TOKEN (2048):** This option tokenizes control over the root ID, creating a single satoshi NFT token.\n\nBy combining these options, you can customize the behavior of your currency in Verus to suit your needs.",
