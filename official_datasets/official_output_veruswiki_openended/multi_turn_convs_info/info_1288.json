            "How do I use the `listreceivedbyaddress` and `listsinceblock` commands in Verus to retrieve information about transactions, and what information can I expect to receive from these commands?",
            "Verus provides two commands, `listreceivedbyaddress` and `listsinceblock`, that allow you to retrieve information about transactions on the Verus network.\n\n**`listreceivedbyaddress` Command:**\nThe `listreceivedbyaddress` command returns a list of transactions that have been received by a specific address. You can use this command to get information about transactions that have been sent to a particular address.\n\nHere's how to use the command:\n```bash\nverus listreceivedbyaddress [minconf] [includeWatchonly]\n```\nWhere:\n* `minconf` is the minimum number of confirmations required for a transaction to be included in the list (default is 1).\n* `includeWatchonly` is a boolean value that specifies whether to include transactions to watch-only addresses (default is false).\n\nThe command returns a JSON object with the following information:\n* `involvesWatchonly`: a boolean indicating whether the transaction involves a watch-only address.\n* `address`: the receiving address.\n* `account`: the account associated with the receiving address (deprecated).\n* `amount`: the total amount of VRSC received by the address.\n* `confirmations`: the number of confirmations of the most recent transaction included.\n\n**`listsinceblock` Command:**\nThe `listsinceblock` command returns all transactions in blocks since a specified block hash or all transactions if no block hash is provided.\n\nHere's how to use the command:\n```bash\nverus listsinceblock [blockhash] [target-confirmations] [includeWatchonly]\n```\nWhere:\n* `blockhash` is the block hash to list transactions since (optional).\n* `target-confirmations` is the minimum number of confirmations required for a transaction to be included in the list (default is 1).\n* `includeWatchonly` is a boolean value that specifies whether to include transactions to watch-only addresses (default is false).\n\nThe command returns a JSON object with the following information:\n* `transactions`: an array of transactions, each with the following properties:\n\t+ `account`: the account associated with the transaction (deprecated).\n\t+ `address`: the VRSC address of the transaction.\n\t+ `category`: the transaction category (send, receive, or move).\n\t+ `amount`: the amount of VRSC in the transaction.\n\nBy using these commands, you can retrieve information about transactions on the Verus network, including the addresses involved, the amounts transferred, and the number of confirmations.",
            "#### Result:\n```json\n[\n {\n  \"involvesWatchonly\" : true,    (bool) Only returned if imported addresses were involved in transaction\n  \"address\" : \"receivingaddress\",  (string) The receiving address\n  \"account\" : \"accountname\",     (string) DEPRECATED.

The account name associated with the transaction. Will be \"\" for the default account.\n  \"address\":\"VRSC_address\",  (string) The VRSC address of the transaction.
