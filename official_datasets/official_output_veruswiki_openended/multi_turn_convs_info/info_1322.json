            "How can you use the `sendmany` and `sendtoaddress` commands to send Verus coins (VRSC) to multiple addresses or a single address, respectively, with options to specify confirmation, comment, and subtract fee from amount?",
            "The `sendmany` and `sendtoaddress` commands in Verus are used to send Verus coins (VRSC) to multiple addresses or a single address, respectively. These commands offer various options to customize the transaction.\n\n**Sendmany Command:**\nThe `sendmany` command is used to send multiple amounts to multiple addresses in a single transaction. The basic syntax is:\n```bash\n> verus sendmany \"\" \"{\\\"address1\\\":amount1,\\\"address2\\\":amount2,...}\"\n```\nHere, `address1`, `address2`, etc. are the Verus addresses to send to, and `amount1`, `amount2`, etc. are the amounts of VRSC to send to each address.\n\nYou can also specify additional options:\n\n* `confirmation`: The number of confirmations required for the transaction to be considered valid.\n* `comment`: A comment to store what the transaction is for.\n* `subtractfeefromamount`: A boolean value indicating whether to subtract the transaction fee from the amounts being sent.\n\nHere's an example with all options:\n```bash\n> verus sendmany \"\" \"{\\\"address1\\\":0.01,\\\"address2\\\":0.02}\" 6 \"testing\" \"[\\\"address1\\\",\\\"address2\\\"]\"\n```\nThis sends 0.01 VRSC to `address1` and 0.02 VRSC to `address2`, with a confirmation requirement of 6, a comment of \"testing\", and subtracting the fee from the amounts.\n\n**Sendtoaddress Command:**\nThe `sendtoaddress` command is used to send a single amount to a single address. The basic syntax is:\n```bash\n> verus sendtoaddress \"VRSC_address\" amount ( \"comment\" \"comment-to\" subtractfeefromamount )\n```\nHere, `VRSC_address` is the Verus address to send to, `amount` is the amount of VRSC to send, `comment` and `comment-to` are optional comments, and `subtractfeefromamount` is a boolean value indicating whether to subtract the transaction fee from the amount.\n\nHere's an example:\n```bash\n> verus sendtoaddress \"VRSC_address\" 0.1 \"comment\" \"comment-to\" true\n```\nThis sends 0.1 VRSC to the specified address, with a comment, comment-to, and subtracting the fee from the amount.\n\nBoth commands return a transaction ID as a result.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use the JSON RPC call to send transactions, which is useful for integrations and automation. The syntax is similar to the `sendmany` command, but with a JSON payload.",

The amount is a real and is rounded to the nearest 0.00000001#### Arguments:\n1. \"VRSC_address\" (string, required) The VRSC address to send to.\n2. \"amount\"   (numeric, required) The amount in VRSC to send. eg 0.1\n3. \"comment\"   (string, optional) A comment used to store what the transaction is for. This is not part of the transaction, just kept in your wallet.\n4. \"comment-to\" (string, optional) A comment to store the name of the person or organization to which you're sending the transaction. This is not part of the transaction, just kept in your wallet.\n5. subtractfeefromamount (boolean, optional, default=false) The fee will be deducted from the amount being sent. The recipient will receive less VRSC than you enter in the amount field.#### Result:\n\"transactionid\" (string) The transaction id.",
