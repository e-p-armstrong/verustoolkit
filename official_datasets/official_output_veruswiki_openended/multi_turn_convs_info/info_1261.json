            "How do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus testnet or mainnet, and what benefits does the new Verus testnet offer?",
            "Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus testnet or mainnet involves a few steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n**Step 1: Create a transaction**\nUse the `verus sendcurrency` command to create a transaction from a multi-signature ID. The format is:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\n**Step 2: Get the raw transaction data**\nUse the `verus z_getoperationstatus` command to get the raw transaction data. You'll need to provide the operation ID returned by `sendcurrency`.\n\n**Step 3: Sign the transaction**\nTake the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs. Use the `verus signrawtransaction` command to sign the transaction:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n**Step 4: Broadcast the transaction**\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using the `verus sendrawtransaction` command:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\nThe new Verus testnet offers a range of benefits, including:\n\n* **Easy GUI for basic operations**: Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets provide an easy-to-use interface for basic operations.\n* **Command line for advanced functions**: The command line interface allows for more advanced functions, giving users flexibility and control.\n* **Decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform**: The Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform.\n* **Unlimited identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains**: The Verus testnet allows for an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains.\n* **Send currencies worldwide**: Send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease.\n* **Convert currencies without an exchange**: Convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way.\n\nOverall, the new Verus testnet offers a powerful and flexible platform for creating and managing decentralized applications, identities, currencies, and blockchains.",
