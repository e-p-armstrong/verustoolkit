            "What are the capabilities of `*.veth@` IDs, and how can they be used to create Tokenized ID control tokens and ERC20 mapped currencies on Ethereum? Additionally, what are the steps to reset a testnet and create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent?",
            "`*.veth@` IDs have two main capabilities: creating 1:1 ERC20 mapped currencies on Ethereum and creating Tokenized ID control tokens.\n\n**Creating ERC20 Mapped Currencies:**\nThese IDs can be used to create ERC20 mapped currencies on Ethereum, which allows for the creation of currencies that are directly tied to the value of an Ethereum-based asset.\n\n**Creating Tokenized ID Control Tokens:**\n`*.veth@` IDs can also be used to create Tokenized ID control tokens, which are a type of next-generation NFT. To create a Tokenized ID control token, you need to define a currency with specific flags and properties. The currency definition should include the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN` flags, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre-allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n\nHere's an example of how to define a currency for a Tokenized ID control token using the `definecurrency` command:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```\n**Resetting a Testnet:**\nTo reset a testnet, you need to close Verus, delete the testnet directories, and then restart the testnet daemon or relaunch Verus Desktop. The directories to delete depend on your operating system:\n\n* Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`\n* Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`\n\n**Creating an Identity with a Fractional Currency as Its Parent:**\nThe `registernamecommitment` command now takes two additional positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. You can use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank. For example, you can specify a parent currency, such as `vrsc-btc`, but no referrer. You can also use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration.",
            "`*.veth@` IDs have the ability, along with root vrsctest IDs, to make 1:1 ERC20 mapped currencies on Ethereum. They can also be used to create Tokenized ID control tokens (see notes for v0.9.4-1), as all types of IDs can, but if they are used to do that, they will have used their currency creation ability for that rather than an ERC20 mapped currency.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release.

Use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank, the example below specifies a parent currency, vrsc-btc , but no referrer. We're now able to use z_addresses to fund the name commitment and identity registration",
