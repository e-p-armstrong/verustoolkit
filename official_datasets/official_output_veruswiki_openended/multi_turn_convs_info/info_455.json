            "How do I get currency statistics, including the current price in reserve, for a specific block or range of blocks on a Verus chain, and how do I refund contributions made to a failed PBaaS chain launch?",
            "To get currency statistics, including the current price in reserve, on a Verus chain, you can use the `getcurrencystate` command. This command can be used in different ways to get statistics for different blocks or ranges of blocks.\n\n**Getting statistics for the most recent block:**\nTo get the currency statistics for the most recent block, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate\n```\nThis command will return the currency statistics, including the current price in reserve, for the most recent block on the `RESERVEWITHPREMINE` chain.\n\n**Getting statistics for a specific block:**\nTo get the currency statistics for a specific block, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\nReplace `blocknum` with the number of the block for which you want to get the statistics.\n\n**Getting statistics for a range of blocks:**\nTo get the currency statistics for a range of blocks, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```\nReplace `startblocknum` with the number of the first block in the range, `endblocknum` with the number of the last block in the range, and `blockstostep` with the number of blocks to step between each statistic.\n\n**Refunding contributions to a failed PBaaS chain launch:**\nIf a PBaaS chain launch fails, you can refund the contributions made to the launch using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME\n```\nReplace `CHAINNAME` with the name of the failed PBaaS chain.\n\nNote that the software is still experimental and unfinished, and should be used at your own risk. It has not been tested for use on mainnet, and is intended for testing and development purposes only.",
