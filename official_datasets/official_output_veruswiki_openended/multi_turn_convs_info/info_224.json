            "What is Verus Vault, and how does it provide an additional layer of security and decentralized funds recovery for VerusID holders?",
            "Verus Vault is a security feature that allows VerusID holders to lock their identities, effectively protecting their funds from theft, even if their private key is compromised. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the funds associated with that identity cannot be spent until it is unlocked. However, the funds can still be staked on the Verus network, earning rewards, and can still receive incoming funds.\n\nTo use Verus Vault, you need to have at least one primary identity and one revocation/recovery ID configured. The revocation and recovery authority identities can still revoke and recover a locked VerusID, bypassing the lock. Meanwhile, anyone with only the primary keys, including a multisig of primary keys, must first unlock the identity and then wait for a predetermined unlock time before they can access the funds.\n\nThis feature provides a decentralized solution to the \"5-dollar wrench attack,\" where an attacker physically forces the owner to unlock their wallet. By setting a delay, such as 24 hours, on the unlock process, you can ensure that even if an attacker gains access to your primary keys, they will not be able to quickly drain your funds.\n\nVerus Vault not only protects your funds but also provides security for your IDs and NFTs. It offers time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can safeguard your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, without relying on a traditional bank.",
            "### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",
