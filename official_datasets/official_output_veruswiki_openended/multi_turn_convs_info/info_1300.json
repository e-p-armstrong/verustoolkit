            "What are the key features and implications of Verus v0.7.2-2, particularly in relation to the new Verus testnet (VRSCTEST), and how does it impact users and the DeFi industry?",
            "Verus v0.7.2-2 is a significant upgrade that brings about several important changes, especially with regards to the new Verus testnet (VRSCTEST). While this upgrade is mandatory for pools and notaries, it is not necessarily required for general Verus node and wallet users. However, it does offer some improvements and a fix for the getblocktemplate API used by pools.\n\nThe Verus testnet has been reset and relaunched on v0.7.2-2, which means that users who had previously launched VRSCTEST from an earlier version must follow specific instructions before running this update. The new Verus DeFi testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network that operates with 50% proof of work and 50% proof of stake, making it available worldwide.\n\nThis testnet introduces several groundbreaking features and capabilities that have the potential to reshape the DeFi industry. Some of the key features include advanced ID capabilities, a DeFi liquidity system integrated into the new network protocol, and various other blockchain-first innovations. These features are currently being tested and hardened on the testnet before being rolled out to the mainnet.\n\nIt's essential to note that all currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have no value and may be reset at any time for testing purposes. However, users can request a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies on the Verus Discord channel (#pbaas-development) to experiment with the new protocols.\n\nOverall, Verus v0.7.2-2 marks a significant milestone in the development of the Verus project, and its features and capabilities have the potential to make a significant impact on the DeFi industry.",
            "Verus v0.7.2-2 is a mandatory for pools and notaries, but not generally mandatory Verus node and wallet upgrade, with support for the new Verus testnet (VRSCTEST) with fully decentralized finance, advanced ID capabilities, and DeFi liquidity system integrated into the new network protocol. While most of the changes in this release are focused on testnet, the mainnet support does include some improvements and a fix for the getblocktemplate API used by pools## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on v0.7.2-2. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO v0.7.2-2, PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RELEASE NOTES BEFORE RUNNING THIS UPDATE**## The New Verus DeFi Testnet\nThis is the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever announced, and we believe it holds the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that it\u2019s hard to adequately cover them all. Below is a list of new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future when considered fully hardened, tested, and ready for worldwide, public scale. Until then, Verus testnet is a fully decentralized blockchain network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running all of the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. If you would like a representative basket of Verus testnet currencies that you can use to try out all of the new protocols from anywhere in the world, simply visit the Verus Discord and ask in the #pbaas-development channel.
