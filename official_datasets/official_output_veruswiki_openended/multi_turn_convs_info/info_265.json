            "What are some important considerations and limitations when working with PBaaS chains in the Verus Desktop, and what kind of license and warranty does the software come with?",
            "When working with PBaaS chains in the Verus Desktop, there are some important considerations and limitations to keep in mind. One key limitation is that if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This is a temporary limitation and will be resolved before the mainnet release.\n\nIt's also important to note that the software is still experimental and unfinished, and users should be aware that they use it at their own risk. The software comes with no warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\nOn the other hand, the software is licensed under a permissive license that allows users to deal with the software without restriction, including the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software. This license also allows users to permit others to whom the software is furnished to do so, subject to certain conditions.\n\nIn particular, the license requires that the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. Additionally, the authors or copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.",
