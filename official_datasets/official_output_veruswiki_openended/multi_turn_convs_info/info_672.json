            "What are the benefits of using Verus' private, internal blockchains, and how do you lock and unlock IDs, as well as perform conversion queries?",
            "Verus' private, internal blockchains offer a range of benefits, including easy setup, bridging of public currencies, and complete control over access. These blockchains can operate independently, yet still interoperate with other blockchains on the Verus network, with no limit on the number of blockchains that can exist simultaneously. This is achieved through a fractal model, which enables unlimited scalability.\n\nOne key feature of Verus IDs is the ability to lock and unlock them, providing an additional layer of security and control. There are two types of locks: time locks and time delays.\n\nA time lock allows you to set a specific block height at which an ID will unlock, using the `updateidentity` command with the `timelock` parameter. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nA time delay, on the other hand, defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. This is also achieved using the `updateidentity` command, but with the `flags` parameter set to 2. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nIt's important to note that revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of any time delay or unlock height. Additionally, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\nVerus also provides a `getcurrencyconverters` API, which allows you to retrieve a list of currencies that meet specific liquidity requirements. For example, you can use the following command to retrieve all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis API is useful for discovering currencies that have sufficient liquidity to support conversions.",
            " private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n## Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nWill return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
