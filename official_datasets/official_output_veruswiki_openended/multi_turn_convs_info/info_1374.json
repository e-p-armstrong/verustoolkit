            "What information is contained in the JSON object returned by Verus for a transaction, and what do each of the fields represent?",
            "The JSON object returned by Verus for a transaction contains various fields that provide information about the transaction. Here's a breakdown of each field:\n\n* `n` (numeric, sprout): This represents the index of the JSDescription within vJoinSplit.\n* `\"jsOutput\"`: `n` (numeric, sprout): This is the index of the output within the JSDescription.\n* `\"output\"`: `n` (numeric, sapling): This is the index of the output within the vShieldedOutput.\n* `\"address\"`: `\"zcashaddress\"` (string): This is the Zcash address involved in the transaction.\n* `\"recovered\"`: `true|false` (boolean, sapling): This field indicates whether the output is not for an address in the wallet. If `true`, it means the output is not for an address in the wallet.\n* `\"value\"`: `x.xxx` (numeric): This is the amount of the transaction in VRSC.\n* `\"valueZat\"`: `xxxx` (numeric): This is the amount of the transaction in zatoshis, which is a smaller unit of VRSC.\n* `\"memo\"`: `\"hexmemo\"` (string): This is the hexadecimal string representation of the memo field, which is an optional field that can be used to store additional information about the transaction.\n* `\"memoStr\"`: `\"memo\"` (string): This field is only returned if the memo field contains valid UTF-8 text. It is a string representation of the memo field.\n\nThese fields provide a comprehensive view of the transaction, including the addresses involved, the amounts transferred, and any additional information stored in the memo field.",
