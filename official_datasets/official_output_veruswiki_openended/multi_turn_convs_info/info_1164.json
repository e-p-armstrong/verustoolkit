            "How do you create a new currency on the Verus testnet, set its properties, and mint new coins, and then launch the testnet?",
            "To create a new currency on the Verus testnet, you need to use the `definecurrency` command. This command allows you to set the properties of your new currency, such as its name, options, proof protocol, currencies it can be converted to, and its initial supply.\n\nHere's an example of how to create a new currency called \"mycoin\" with the `definecurrency` command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nLet's break down what each part of this command does:\n\n* `name` sets the name of the currency to \"mycoin\".\n* `options` is an integer that configures various properties of the currency.\n* `proofprotocol` is set to 2, which means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins. This is known as PROOF_CHAINID.\n* `currencies` specifies the currencies that can be converted to \"mycoin\". In this case, it's \"vrsctest\" and \"gold\".\n* `minpreconversion` sets the minimum amounts of \"vrsctest\" and \"gold\" needed to convert to \"mycoin\".\n* `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of \"mycoin\" to 20,000 units.\n\nOnce you've created your new currency, you can mint new coins using the `sendcurrency` command. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command mints 10,000 new \"mycoin\" units and sends them to the address \"mike@\".\n\nFinally, to launch the testnet, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST\n```\nThis command starts the Verus daemon with the VRSCTEST chain, allowing you to interact with the testnet.",
            "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```**Launching the testnet:**\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST\n```\n# Disclaimer",
