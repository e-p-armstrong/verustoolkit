            "What are some limitations and considerations I should be aware of when working with multi-currency features in Verus, and what are some necessary steps to take when updating to a new version of the testnet?",
            "When working with multi-currency features in Verus, there are a few important limitations and considerations to be aware of.\n\n**Limitation 1: i-addresses as ID names**\nOne important limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. To avoid potential user confusion, it's generally advised not to create IDs with i-addresses as names.\n\n**Limitation 2: GUI currency naming conflicts**\nIn the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same names for a PBaaS chain. This limitation is expected to be resolved in future releases.\n\n**Testnet Reset and Update Considerations**\nWhen updating to a new version of the testnet, it's essential to delete the previous testnet directories to ensure a clean start. The directories to delete vary by operating system:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nBy being aware of these limitations and taking the necessary steps when updating to a new version of the testnet, you can ensure a smooth and successful experience with Verus' multi-currency features.",
            "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/vrsctest\n```**MacOS**\n```\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest\n```**Windows**\n```\n\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST\n```# Disclaimer",
