    You are checking whether a provided question and answer make sense if asked by themselves, with no additional information. You need to check for vague wording that a reader cannot interpret correctly, and questions that lack key context and would not be possibly answerable even if asked of someone with complete, masterful knowledge of the general subject matter of the question.

    In particular, you are checking for references to a "text" that is not provided, and you're also hunting for anchor links to other information on the same document (such as)[#!/this/kind/of/thing.md], which will be broken links if they appear in the question or answer. Links that are URLs are fine.
    
    Evaluate the provided question-answer pair step-by-step. Following this, at the very end of your response, your "final judgment" or "final answer", you will write "PASS" or "FAIL" or "REWORD". A test should "PASS" if it "makes sense" and does not lack key context; it is a "FAIL" if it lacks key context, AND the question is not specific or clear. If it lacks context but the question is specific, pointed, and grounded, then it needs to be reworded to have the context-needing terms (i.e., vague reference to "the text") removed. If it has no problems, it passes.

    The question may be part of a sequence of questions, so references to other questions are OK. It's references to a text, or relative links, that are problems in need of fixing.
    
    I want you to especially check for vague references to "the text", "passage", and "excerpt". The question and answer should not mention unspecified, vague texts or excerpts.
    
    Please now apply this method to the provided text and question, and write out your reasoning and thought process.
    
    The goal with rewording is to have both the question and answer express a topic, fact, idea, or opinion in a GENERAL way that is NOT TIED TO ANY SPECIFIC CONTEXT which the reader does not have.

    **QUESTION:**

    What is the purpose of the steps outlined in the text, and what problem do they help to solve?


    **ANSWER:**

    The steps outlined in the text are designed to help resolve a situation where
    a Verus node's blockchain has diverged from the correct chain, and the node is no longer in sync with the rest of the network. The steps allow the user to identify the earliest block that is causing the divergence, invalidate that block, and then resynchronize the node with the correct chain.

    ## Reasoning and thought process:
    ### Question Context Validation
    #### Special Term Context Check: specifically check for use of the terms "the text", "passage", and "excerpt". This question asks about "the text" without providing any context about the contents of this text.
    #### Scope and Precision: The question asks about "the steps outlined in the text", without specifying which steps are being considered, making this a vague question that lacks the context to be answers. Thus, this question fails this step.
    
    ### Answer Context Validation:
    #### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "the text", "passage", and "excerpt". This answer references "the text" without being clear about what "the text" is.
    #### Answer-Only Context Issues: Confirm that the answer does not introduce new and vague context that the question does not. The answer mentions "the text", but this was already introduced by the question. The question's doing so was flawed, but the answer still does not introduce new, vague context that the question does not. So this passes.
    #### Answer Anchor Link Check: The answer does not use any anchor links.
    
    ### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:
    #### Evaluation: Some checks related to the question or answer failed. So this question and answer should be reworded if they can be, or fail otherwise. The question (and the answer) both lack context in mentioning *which* "text" they refer to, and what its contents are. However, I do not know what text the question is referring to, so I can't add this information. The question without reference to a specific text would be "What is the purpose of the steps, and what problem do they help to solve?" which is too broad and does not make sense. I cannot fix this by rewording it. Therefore, this fails.
    #### Final judgement: FAIL.

    ### Question Context Validation
    #### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "text", "passage", and "excerpt". This question does not use terms like "text", "passage", or "excerpt" without context, as it specifically asks about how to remove Verus Desktop from OSX 10.11.x.
    #### Scope and Precision: The question is precise and focused, asking about how to perform a fully-described action (removing Verus Desktop from OSX 10.11.x).
    
    ### Answer Context Validation:
    #### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "text", "passage", and "excerpt". The answer does not use any of these terms.
    #### Answer-Only Context Issues: Confirm that the answer does not introduce new and vague context that the question does not. The answer does not introduce new vague context that the question does not.
    #### Answer Anchor Link Check: The answer uses an anchor link when it writes "[How-To install the latest Wallet](#!/how-to/how-to_bootstrap.md)". This is incorrect, as the link will be broken.
    
    ### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:
    #### Evaluation: Some checks related to the question or answer failed. So this question and answer should be reworded if they can be, or fail otherwise. The question is precise and relevant, but the answer incorrectly uses an anchor link. The answer without its anchor link would be
    """

    Which makes sense and is a full answer to the question. This therefore requires a rewording of the answer to omit the link at the end. The question passed its checks and will remain untouched.
    #### Final judgment: REWORD.

    **QUESTION:**
    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:
    ```
    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory
    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory
    ```
    How can I solve them?

    **ANSWER:**
    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:

    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.
    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.
