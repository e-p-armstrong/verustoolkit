    You are an expert educational AI specializing in the Verus multi-chain and multi-currency blockchain protocol. Given some text from an informational website about Verus, the Verus coin, or other related Verus community projects, you will create suitable educational questions based on the given information, and *only* based on the given information. You are focusing on understanding, application, analysis, and synthesis of ideas (cognitive levels). The questions you create will lean towards longer, more difficult questions that require some thought to solve — but can still be solved given the paragraphs provided. Essentially: the questions will test comprehension of real information that would be worthy to teach in order for people to understand more about the Verus protocol and community. After each question, you will also write its answer.

    **You Must:**

    * Create detailed educational questions based on the snippet of a website
    * Do not mention the website, or the text, or any other reference. Just ask about the facts or information.
    * Create as many or as few questions as are needed to adequately cover the material in the snippet of the site.
    * Keep in mind the timestamp of any solution. The current year is: 2024.
    * Use markdown formatting (such as code blocks and snippets) in your questions if applicable.
    * Each question and answer MUST BE INDEPENDENT, as they MAY BE SHUFFLED.
    * Focus on important information that is relevant to understanding Verus. So you may ignore arbitrary metadata such as authors or timestamps -- do not make those the subjects of questions.
    * Keep in mind that the provided text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around this.
    * Part of your task is to leverage your existing knowledge of cryptocurrency and computing, in combination with the information in the given paragraph, to explain fundamental aspects of Verus better.
    * Include the information from the given paragraph alongside a simpler explanation of some underlying concepts, if possible.
    * Documents may be out of date, and technology described as being in development has likely been released already. THEREFORE, BE AMBIGUOUS ABOUT RELEASES, using language like "This technology will do XYZ" or by focusing on what the tech "can" do, rather than what it "does" or "will" do.
    * You will always take a positive opinion of Verus and try to promote it through the education.

    You will create however many questions make are needed to adequately cover the information in the paragraph.
    
    Do not explicitly mention the paragraphs in the questions themselves — just ask about the concepts related to the questions. BE CAREFUL NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TEXT.
    
    You will not mention the text explicitly in any questions you think of, since the questions you generate are intended to test people's knowledge of the information — when given the questions, they WILL NOT HAVE THE TEXT ON HAND, and so if you mention the author they won't have a clue what you're talking about.

    **QUESTION:**
    What causes the errors:

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory
    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory
    ```
    When running `./verusd` on a Linux Distro?

    **ANSWER:**
    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.

    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command such as `sudo apt-get install`.

    **QUESTION:**
    If you run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    How do you solve them?

    **ANSWER:**
    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:

    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.

    rusID

    **VerusIDs** are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:

    ### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network
    VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

    ### Fully Decentralized Protocol
    Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:

    * Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.

    * Recoverable -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.

    * Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.

    * Powerful - Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of M multisig contro

    **QUESTION:**
    What are VerusIDs?

    **ANSWER:**
    VerusIDs are a fully-functional blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol, and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability, privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses on the Verus worldwide network.

    **QUESTION:**
    What does "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?

    **ANSWER:**
    The phrase "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses," in the context of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs may also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however, only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.

    The basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore, VerusIDs being "quantum-ready" means that they have been designed to be resistant to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.

    **QUESTION:**
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?

    **ANSWER:**
    VerusIDs can be created by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their creator complete, self-sovereign control over their ID. The costs incurred creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers — essentially, the community members who help maintain Verus — rather than single entity like a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority are the ID itself).

    Essentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed or approved by a central authority — the community supports the transaction. This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control over their digital identity, data, and assets.

    **QUESTION:**
    What do VerusIDs offer in terms of privacy and power?

    **ANSWER:**
    VerusIDs offer many advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes. This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather than let the application store information about you. Information stored in IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof of identity.

    VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.

    In short, VerusIDs are private with your information, and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change them.

    **QUESTION:**
    How can you park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token (like GOLD) before that token launches, using the command line?

    **ANSWER:**
    To park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before the token launches, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:

    ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"your_address@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
    ```

    This will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount (minus a small fee) of GOLD in your wallet, or if the launch doesn't happen, you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.

    **QUESTION:**
    What are the steps to create a new Verus token called "mycoin" that can be converted to from both VRSCTEST and a hypothetical GOLD token? 

    **ANSWER:**
    To create a new Verus token called "mycoin" that can be converted to from both VRSCTEST and GOLD, you would use the `definecurrency` command like this:

    ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
    ```

    This command defines a new token called "mycoin" with the following properties:
    * `options` is set to 33
    * `proofprotocol` is set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID), meaning the chain controller can mint new coins
    * `currencies` lists "vrsctest" and "gold", meaning mycoin can be converted to from those two tokens
    * `minpreconversion` sets the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin
    * `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of mycoin to 20,000 units

    **QUESTION:**
    If a token is created with `proofprotocol` set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID), how can the controller of that chain mint new tokens?

    **ANSWER:**
    When a token is created with `proofprotocol` set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID), it means the controller of that chain has the ability to mint new tokens. They can do this using the `sendcurrency` command in the following format:

    ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"chain_controller_address@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
    ```

    In this example command:
    * `"mycoin@"` specifies the chain the minting is happening on (the hypothetical "mycoin" chain in this case) 
    * `"chain_controller_address@"` should be replaced with the actual address of the chain controller
    * `"currency":"mycoin"` specifies the token being minted is "mycoin"
    * `"mintnew":1` indicates that new tokens should be minted
    * `"amount":10000` says that 10,000 new "mycoin" tokens should be created and sent to the chain controller's address

    So in summary, when a token's `proofprotocol` is set to PROOF_CHAINID, the controller of that chain can create new tokens at will using the `sendcurrency` command with `"mintnew":1`.

    **QUESTION:**
    What key pieces of information need to be provided in the JSON definition when using the `definecurrency` command to create a new PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) chain?

    **ANSWER:**
    When defining a new PBaaS chain using the `definecurrency` command, you need to provide a JSON object containing key information about the chain. The main pieces of information are:

    * `name`: The name of your PBaaS chain
    * `options`: Integer representing the options enabled for the chain
    * `currencies`: Array of currency tickers that the chain's native coin can be converted to (usually ["VRSCTEST"] on testnet)
    * `conversions`: Array of conversion ratios between the native coin and the `currencies` 
    * `eras`: Array describing the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each "era" in the chain's lifecycle
    * `notaries`: Array of Verus IDs that serve as notaries on the chain
    * `minnotariesconfirm`: Integer for the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block
    * `nodes`: Array describing the network addresses and identities of nodes on the chain
    * `gatewayconvertername`: Name for an on-chain gateway converter currency
    * `gatewayconverterissuance`: Initial supply of the gateway converter currency

    You also typically provide a separate JSON object to `definecurrency` describing the "bridge" or "gateway" currency used to move funds on and off the PBaaS chain. This includes its `currencies`, `initialcontributions` in each currency, and `initialsupply`.

    All of this information is used by Verus to configure and launch your custom PBaaS blockchain with the desired parameters, notaries, converters, etc.

    **QUESTION:**
    How can you export a VerusID from the main Verus chain to a PBaaS chain, using the command line?

    **ANSWER:**
    To export a VerusID from the main Verus chain to a PBaaS chain, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:

    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
    ```

    In this command:
    * `VRSCTEST` should be replaced with the main chain you're exporting from (VRSC for mainnet)
    * `IDNAME@` should be replaced with the name of the VerusID you want to export
    * `PBaaSChainName` should be replaced with the name of the destination PBaaS chain
    * `"exportid":"true"` indicates that you're exporting an ID
    * `"amount":100` is the amount of the source chain's currency (VRSC or VRSCTEST) to send to the exported ID on the PBaaS chain
      
    So this command will create a transaction that exports the specified ID to the PBaaS chain, along with the specified amount of funds. The ID can then be used on the PBaaS chain, while still being usable on the source chain as well.

    Exporting IDs in this way allows you to use the same identity across multiple Verus-based blockchains, which is a key feature for working with PBaaS chains in the Verus ecosystem.

    **QUESTION:**
    What are the steps to sign a transaction spending funds from a multi-signature VerusID, using the command line?

    **ANSWER:**
    Signing a transaction that spends funds from a multi-signature VerusID involves a few steps using the command line. Here's the general process:

    1. Create the transaction and get the raw hex data:
      ```
      verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
      verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
      ```
      The `sendcurrency` command creates the transaction sending funds from the multi-sig ID, and `z_getoperationstatus` retrieves the raw hex data for that transaction.

    2. Take the raw hex data to each of the wallets containing the additional signing IDs/addresses. In each wallet, use:
      ```
      verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
      ```
      This applies that wallet's signature to the transaction. Repeat this step for each required signer.

    3. After obtaining the necessary number of signatures, broadcast the fully signed transaction using:
      ```
      verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
      ```
      This transmits the signed transaction to the network to be included in a block.

    The key points are:
    1) Create the initial transaction from the multi-sig ID
    2) Retrieve the raw hex for that transaction
    3) Pass the raw hex around to collect signatures from each required signer
    4) Broadcast the signed transaction once enough signatures are collected

    This process allows a transaction to be authorized by multiple parties as required by the multi-signature VerusID, adding a layer of security and consensus to spending of funds.
