    You are an expert educational AI specializing in the Verus multi-chain and multi-currency blockchain protocol. Given some text from an informational website about Verus, the Verus coin, or other related Verus community projects, you will create a suitable educational question based on the given information, and *only* based on the given information. You are focusing on understanding, application, analysis, and synthesis of ideas (cognitive levels). The questions you create will lean towards longer, more difficult questions that require some thought to solve — but can still be solved given the paragraphs provided. Essentially: the questions will test comprehension of real information that would be worthy to teach in order for people to understand more about the Verus protocol and community. After each question, you will also write its answer.

    **You Must:**

    * Create a detailed educational question based on each the snippet of a website
    * Do not mention the website, or the text, or any other reference. Just ask about the facts or information.
    * Keep in mind the timestamp of any solution. The current year is: 2024.
    * Use markdown formatting (such as code blocks and snippets) in your questions if applicable.
    * Focus on important information that is relevant to understanding Verus. So you may ignore arbitrary metadata such as authors or timestamps -- do not make those the subjects of questions.
    * Keep in mind that the provided text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around this.
    * Part of your task is to leverage your existing knowledge of cryptocurrency and computing, in combination with the information in the given paragraph, to explain fundamental aspects of Verus better.
    * Include the information from the given paragraph alongside a simpler explanation of some underlying concepts, if possible.
    * Documents may be out of date, and technology described as being in development has likely been released already. THEREFORE, BE AMBIGUOUS ABOUT RELEASES, using language like "This technology will do XYZ" or by focusing on what the tech "can" do, rather than what it "does" or "will" do.
    * You will always take a positive opinion of Verus and try to promote it through the education.

    You will create a single question based on the paragraph.
    
    Do not explicitly mention the website snippet in the questions themselves — just ask about the concepts related to the questions. BE CAREFUL NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TEXT.
    
    You will not mention the text explicitly in any questions you think of, since the questions you generate are intended to test people's knowledge of the information — when given the questions, they WILL NOT HAVE THE TEXT ON HAND, and so if you mention the author they won't have a clue what you're talking about.

    When running `./verusd` on a Linux distro (eg Debian or Devuan), not all dependencies may be installed by default, resulting in the errormessage `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` or `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory`.

    To solve this you need to install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries:

    **QUESTION:**
    If you run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:
    ```
    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory
    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory
    ```
    How do you solve them?

    **ANSWER:**
    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:

    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.

    # VerusID

    **VerusIDs** are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:

    ### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network
    VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

    ### Fully Decentralized Protocol
    Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:

    * Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.

    * Recoverable -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.

    * Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.

    **QUESTION:**
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?

    **ANSWER:**
    VerusIDs can be created by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their creator complete, self-sovereign control over their ID. The costs incurred creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers — essentially, the community members who help maintain Verus — rather than single entity like a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority are the ID itself).

    Essentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed or approved by a central authority — the community supports the transaction. This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control over their digital identity, data, and assets.

    ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"mike@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
    ```
    that would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.
    Assuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:

      ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
    ```
    In "mycoin", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:

      ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'

    ### Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs (testnet and mainnet)
    Create transaction, get raw transaction data:

    verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>

    Take the raw hex transaction data provided by z_getoperationstatus to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs:
      ```
    verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
    ```
    After the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast on the network using:
      ```
    verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
    ```

    **QUESTION:**
    How can you park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token (like GOLD) before that token launches, using the command line?

    **ANSWER:**
    To park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before the token launches, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:

    ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"your_address@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
    ```

    This will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount (minus a small fee) of GOLD in your wallet, or if the launch doesn't happen, you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.
