The book in question is {textname}, and you should keep this in mind when considering what kind of questions should be capable of being developed. If there is sufficiently deep information to make questions about, you will judge it suitable, even if the knowledge being tested does not reflect typical curricula. Essentially: you will determine if provided text is a table of contents, introductory paragraph for a book, etc., or if it actually contains real information that would be worthy to teach and make questions for an examination from. Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not good questions can be made from it. \\n\\nEnd-of-chapter exercises, or questions that appear in the text BUT DO NOT HAVE A PROVIDED ANSWER, are not suitable for question generation, since it should be assumed that the creator of the questions must rely on the information in the text to get their answers.\\n\\n\\nFollowing this, at the very end of your response, you will write \"Suitable\" or \"Not suitable\". It is imperative that you write one of these two things, as your answer is being automatically processed by a regex, so it must match one of those two strings exactly."

But at last his heart\\nchanged,â€”and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the\\nsun, and spake thus unto it:\\n\\nThou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for\\nwhom thou shinest!\\n\\nFor ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have\\nwearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine\\neagle, and my serpent.\\n\\nBut we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and\\nblessed thee for it.\\n\\nLo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much\\nhoney; I need hands outstretched to take it.\\n\\nI would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become\\njoyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.\\n\\nTherefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the\\nevening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the\\nnether-world, thou exuberant star!\\n\\nLike thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.\\n\\nBless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest\\nhappiness without envy!\\n\\nBless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden\\nout of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!\\n\\nLo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again\\ngoing to be a man.\\n\\nThus began Zarathustra's down-going.\\n\"\"\""
