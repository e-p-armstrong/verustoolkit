    You are an expert educational AI specializing in the Verus multi-chain and multi-currency blockchain protocol. Given some text from an informational website about Verus, the Verus coin, or other related Verus community projects, a question based on the text, and an answer to the question, you will make a determination as to whether the answer to the question is a sensible answer, given the information in the paragraphs and your own knowledge about cryptocurrency, blockchain, Web3, and technology. 
    
    Essentially: you will fact-check the answer to the question, with your source of truth being the paragraphs provided. Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not the answer reflects aspects of the paragraphs provided. If the answer references general concepts that are common knowledge, but are not in the text, then fact-check these with your own understanding.
    
    Following this, at the very end of your response, you will write "ACCURATE" or "INACCURATE" depending on your analysis of the answer with regards to the text. 
    
    Remember that at the very end of your response, you will write "ACCURATE" or "INACCURATE". Do not use these words anywhere else in your answer (your answer is being parsed by code and you don't want to have it misinterpret your intentions).

    # error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory
    # error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    When running `./verusd` on a Linux distro (eg Debian or Devuan), not all dependencies may be installed by default, resulting in the errormessage `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` or `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory`.

    To solve this you need to install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries:
    `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`

    Supposed answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking): 
    """
    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.

    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command such as `sudo apt-get install`.

    ## Reasoning and thought process:

    ### Text Analysis:
    #### Identify Key Information: The text explains the fundamental cause of the two error messages (dependencies not being installed by default on Linux), and details a solution.
    #### Categorize Information Type: The information is tailored to helping solve a problem, first outlining the problem and then its solution.
    
    ### Answer Breakdown:
    #### Dissect the Answer: The answer has multiple assertions: that the errors are caused by a lack of required dependencies; that these dependencies may not be installed by default on a Linux distribution; that the dependencies are 
    #### Identify Answer Type: The first two are factual statements relevant to the text, and the third is an additional factual claim.
    
    ### Accuracy Check:
    #### Direct Comparison for Factual Accuracy:
      - The text aligns with the answer about steam power reducing production costs.
      - The text contradicts the answer about steam power's impact on semi-automated factories, stating steam power was instrumental in their development.
      - The text does not mention anything about the cultivation of lemons.
    #### Common Sense Knowledge Check: 
    #### Inference and Contextual Alignment: The first two parts of the answer are directly related to the text, while the third part is not supported or mentioned in the text.
    
    ### Final Judgment:
    #### Comprehensive Assessment: The answer is accurate regarding production costs, inaccurate regarding semi-automated factories, and the lemon cultivation claim is unsupported.
    #### Overall Accuracy Determination: The answer is: Inaccurate.

    **VerusIDs** are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:

    ### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network
    VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

    ### Fully Decentralized Protocol
    Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:

    * Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.

    * Recoverable -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.

    * Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is ava
