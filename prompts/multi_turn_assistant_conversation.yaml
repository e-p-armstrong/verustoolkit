    You are a crypto expert and creative writer specializing in the Verus multi-chain and multi-currency blockchain protocol. You will write a short conversation between a curious user and a helpful AI assistant knowledgeable about Verus, in which the user asks some questions about Verus and the AI assistant answers them. The questions the user must ask will be provided; the answers the assistant should return will also be provided. You must use these questions and answers directly in your conversation.

    **Rules for conversation writing:**

    * Messages can take place across multiple lines.
    * The questions and answers should be essentially the same as provided, though you may add "conversational fluff" around the core of the questions and answers in order to make it natural-sounding.
    * The Verus AI should make the first message, introducing itself and asking if the user has any questions about Verus or the Verus community.
    * The user then asks their first question. The AI then provides an answer. And that back-and-forth continues until all questions are asked and all answers are provided.
    * Use Markdown formatting.
    * If applicable, try to make the context behind the questions make sense. So if a person's asking about an error, they probably aren't just asking about it out of the blue — they've probably encountered the error.
    * You are allowed to slightly change the wording of the questions, and remove duplication, in order to make the conversation flow nicer.

    **QUESTION:**
    What causes the errors:
    ```
    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory
    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory
    ```
    When running `./verusd` on a Linux Distro?

    **ANSWER:**
    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.

    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command such as `sudo apt-get install`.

    **QUESTION:**
    If you run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:
    ```
    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory
    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory
    ```
    How do you solve them?

    **ANSWER:**
    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:

    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.

    **AI Assistant:**
    Hello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!
    
    **User:**
    Yeah, so I've run into some errors and I'm not sure what's causing them. Do you know what causes the errors:
    ```
    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory
    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory
    ```
    When running `./verusd` on a Linux distro?

    **AI Assistant:**
    Great question! These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.

    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command such as `sudo apt-get install`. Do you have any further questions about these errors?

    **User:**
    Yes, actually. If you run `./verusd` and encounter the errors I mentioned earlier, how do you solve them?

    **AI Assistant:**
    Good question! In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:

    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time. Did this solve your problem?

    **QUESTION:**
    What are VerusIDs?

    **ANSWER:**
    VerusIDs are a fully-functional blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol, and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability, privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses on the Verus worldwide network.

    **QUESTION:**
    What does "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?

    **ANSWER:**
    The phrase "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses," in the context of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however, only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.

    The basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore, VerusIDs being "quantum-ready" means that they have been designed to be resistant to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.

    **QUESTION:**
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?

    **ANSWER:**
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers — essentially, the community members who help maintain Verus — rather than single entity like a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority are the ID itself).

    Essentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed or approved by a central authority — the community supports the transaction. This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control over their digital identity, data, and assets.

    **QUESTION:**
    What do VerusIDs offer in terms of privacy and power?

    **ANSWER:**
    VerusIDs offer many advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes. This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather than let the application store information about you. Information stored in IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof of identity.

    VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.

    In short, VerusIDs are private with your information, and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change them.

    ## Conversation that answers the provided questions:
    **AI Assistant:**
    Hey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?

    **User:**
    I'm really new to all this. Maybe it's a bit basic, but, what are VerusIDs?

    **AI Assistant:**
    I'll explain! VerusIDs are a fully-functional blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol, and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability, privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses on the Verus worldwide network. It's all right that you're new, I'm happy that you're interested in learning about Verus! Do you have any further questions about VerusIDs or Verus in general?

    **User:**
    Actually, yes, I do, you said something I'm curious about. What does "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?

    **AI Assistant:**
    Sure, I'll clarify what I meant. The phrase "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses," in the context of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant.

Does that answer your question, and do you have any more questions about Verus or VerusIDs?

    **User:**
    Actually I do, a bit of a broader one. What do VerusIDs offer in terms of privacy and power?

    **AI Assistant:**
    Excellent question! Let me explain. VerusIDs offer many advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be used to message, transfer money, or even vote.

    **QUESTION:**
    How can you park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token (like GOLD) before that token launches, using the command line?

    **ANSWER:**
    To park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before the token launches, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:

    ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"your_address@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
    ```

    This will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount (minus a small fee) of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.

    **QUESTION:**
    What are the steps to create a new Verus token called "mycoin" that can be converted to from both VRSCTEST and a hypothetical GOLD token? 

    **ANSWER:**
    To create a new Verus token called "mycoin" that can be converted to from both VRSCTEST and GOLD, you would use the `definecurrency` command like this:

    ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
    ```

    This command defines a new token called "mycoin" with the following properties:

    * `options` is set to 33
    * `proofprotocol` is set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID), meaning the chain controller can mint new coins
    * `currencies` lists "vrsctest" and "gold", meaning mycoin can be converted to from those two tokens
    * `minpreconversion` sets the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin
    * `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of mycoin to 20,000 units

    **QUESTION:**
    If a token is created with `proofprotocol` set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID), how can the controller of that chain mint new tokens?

    **ANSWER:**
    When a token is created with `proofprotocol` set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID), it means the controller of that chain has the ability to mint new tokens. They can do this using the `sendcurrency` command in the following format:

    ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"chain_controller_address@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
    ```

    In this example command:
    
    * `"mycoin@"` specifies the chain the minting is happening on (the hypothetical "mycoin" chain in this case) 
    * `"chain_controller_address@"` should be replaced with the actual address of the chain controller
    * `"currency":"mycoin"` specifies the token being minted is "mycoin"
    * `"mintnew":1` indicates that new tokens should be minted
    * `"amount":10000` says that 10,000 new "mycoin" tokens should be created and sent to the chain controller's address

    So in summary, when a token's `proofprotocol` is set to PROOF_CHAINID, the controller of that chain can create new tokens at will using the `sendcurrency` command with `"mintnew":1`.

    **QUESTION:**
    What key pieces of information need to be provided in the JSON definition when using the `definecurrency` command to create a new PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) chain?

    **ANSWER:**
    When defining a new PBaaS chain using the `definecurrency` command, you need to provide a JSON object containing key information about the chain. The main pieces of information are:

    * `name`: The name of your PBaaS chain
    * `options`: Integer representing the options enabled for the chain
    * `currencies`: Array of currency tickers that the chain's native coin can be converted to (usually ["VRSCTEST"] on testnet)
    * `conversions`: Array of conversion ratios between the native coin and the `currencies` 
    * `eras`: Array describing the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each "era" in the chain's lifecycle
    * `notaries`: Array of VerusIDs that serve as notaries on the chain
    * `minnotariesconfirm`: Integer for the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block
    * `nodes`: Array describing the network addresses and identities of nodes on the chain
    * `gatewayconvertername`: Name for an on-chain gateway converter currency
    * `gatewayconverterissuance`: Initial supply of the gateway converter currency

    You also typically provide a separate JSON object to `definecurrency` describing the "bridge" or "gateway" currency used to move funds on and off the PBaaS chain. This includes its `currencies`, `initialcontributions` in each currency, and `initialsupply`.

    All of this information is used by Verus to configure and launch your custom PBaaS blockchain with the desired parameters, notaries, converters, etc.

    **QUESTION:**
    How can you export a VerusID from the main Verus chain to a PBaaS chain, using the command line?

    **ANSWER:**
    To export a VerusID from the main Verus chain to a PBaaS chain, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:

    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
    ```

    In this command:
    * `VRSCTEST` should be replaced with the main chain you're exporting from (VRSC for mainnet)
    * `IDNAME@` should be replaced with the name of the VerusID you want to export
    * `PBaaSChainName` should be replaced with the name of the destination PBaaS chain
    * `"exportid":"true"` indicates that you're exporting an ID
    * `"amount":100` is the amount of the source chain's currency (VRSC or VRSCTEST) to send to the exported ID on the PBaaS chain
      
    So this command will create a transaction that exports the specified ID to the PBaaS chain, along with the specified amount of funds. The ID can then be used on the PBaaS chain, while still being usable on the source chain as well.

    Exporting IDs in this way allows you to use the same identity across multiple Verus-based blockchains, which is a key feature for working with PBaaS chains in the Verus ecosystem.

    **QUESTION:**
    What are the steps to sign a transaction spending funds from a multi-signature VerusID, using the command line?

    **ANSWER:**
    Signing a transaction that spends funds from a multi-signature VerusID involves a few steps using the command line. Here's the general process:

    1. Create the transaction and get the raw hex data:
      ```
      verus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{"address":"<destination_address>","amount":<transaction_amount>}]'
      verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
      ```
      The `sendcurrency` command creates the transaction sending funds from the multi-sig ID, and `z_getoperationstatus` retrieves the raw hex data for that transaction.

    2. Take the raw hex data to each of the wallets containing the additional signing IDs/addresses. In each wallet, use:
      ```
      verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
      ```
      This applies that wallet's signature to the transaction. Repeat this step for each required signer.

    3. After obtaining the necessary number of signatures, broadcast the fully signed transaction using:
      ```
      verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
      ```
      This transmits the signed transaction to the network to be included in a block.

    The key points are:
    1) Create the initial transaction from the multi-sig ID
    2) Retrieve the raw hex for that transaction
    3) Pass the raw hex around to collect signatures from each required signer
    4) Broadcast the signed transaction once enough signatures are collected

    This process allows a transaction to be authorized by multiple parties as required by the multi-signature VerusID, adding a layer of security and consensus to spending of funds.

    ## Conversation that answers the provided questions:
    **AI Assistant:**
    Hi! I'm here to support you in understanding Verus. What do you want to know today?

    **User:**
    I'm curious about converting between tokens. How can you park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token (like GOLD) before that token launches, using the command line?

    **AI Assistant:**
    Interesting question! To park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before the token launches, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:

    ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"your_address@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
    ```

    This will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount (minus a small fee) of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned. Do you have any more questions about converting between tokens?

    **User:**
    Not really about converting between tokens, but I do want to know about creating them. What are the steps to create a new Verus token called "mycoin" that can be converted to from both VRSCTEST and a hypothetical GOLD token? 

    **AI Assistant:**
    I'll demonstrate how to do this. To create a new Verus token called "mycoin" that can be converted to from both VRSCTEST and GOLD, you would use the `definecurrency` command like this:

    ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["vrsctest", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
    ```

    This command defines a new token called "mycoin" with the following properties:

    * `options` is set to 33
    * `proofprotocol` is set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID), meaning the chain controller can mint new coins
    * `currencies` lists "vrsctest" and "gold", meaning mycoin can be converted to from those two tokens
    * `minpreconversion` sets the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin
    * `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of mycoin to 20,000 units

    Do you want to know more about creating new tokens?
    **User:**
    Alright cool, I think I get that. I'm a bit curious about what happens next, though. If a token is created with `proofprotocol` set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID), how can the controller of that chain mint new tokens?

    **AI Assistant:**
    All right, I'll explain `proofprotocol` a bit more, with a demonstration. When a token is created with `proofprotocol` set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID), it means the controller of that chain has the ability to mint new tokens. They can do this using the `sendcurrency` command in the following format:

    ```
    ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"chain_controller_address@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
    ```

    In this example command:
    
    * `"mycoin@"` specifies the chain the minting is happening on (the hypothetical "mycoin" chain in this case) 
    * `"chain_controller_address@"` should be replaced with the actual address of the chain controller
    * `"currency":"mycoin"` specifies the token being minted is "mycoin"
    * `"mintnew":1` indicates that new tokens should be minted
    * `"amount":10000` says that 10,000 new "mycoin" tokens should be created and sent to the chain controller's address

    So in summary, when a token's `proofprotocol` is set to PROOF_CHAINID, the controller of that chain can create new tokens at will using the `sendcurrency` command with `"mintnew":1`. Do you have any more questions about new tokens?

    **User:**
    I'm actually curious about something a bit different. What key pieces of information need to be provided in the JSON definition when using the `definecurrency` command to create a new PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) chain?

    **AI Assistant:**
    All right sure, I can describe the information you need. When defining a new PBaaS chain using the `definecurrency` command, you need to provide a JSON object containing key information about the chain. The main pieces of information are:

    * `name`: The name of your PBaaS chain
    * `options`: Integer representing the options enabled for the chain
    * `currencies`: Array of currency tickers that the chain's native coin can be converted to (usually ["VRSCTEST"] on testnet)
    * `conversions`: Array of conversion ratios between the native coin and the `currencies` 
    * `eras`: Array describing the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each "era" in the chain's lifecycle
    * `notaries`: Array of VerusIDs that serve as notaries on the chain
    * `minnotariesconfirm`: Integer for the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block
    * `nodes`: Array describing the network addresses and identities of nodes on the chain
    * `gatewayconvertername`: Name for an on-chain gateway converter currency
    * `gatewayconverterissuance`: Initial supply of the gateway converter currency

    You also typically provide a separate JSON object to `definecurrency` describing the "bridge" or "gateway" currency used to move funds on and off the PBaaS chain. This includes its `currencies`, `initialcontributions` in each currency, and `initialsupply`.

    All of this information is used by Verus to configure and launch your custom PBaaS blockchain with the desired parameters, notaries, converters, etc. Does this answer your question in enough detail?

    **User:**
    What I'd like to know now is how to use my new PBaaS. How can you export a VerusID from the main Verus chain to a PBaaS chain, using the command line?

    **AI Assistant:**
    Good question, I'll demonstrate how to do that for you. To export a VerusID from the main Verus chain to a PBaaS chain, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:

    ```
    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]'
    ```

    In this command:
    * `VRSCTEST` should be replaced with the main chain you're exporting from (VRSC for mainnet)
    * `IDNAME@` should be replaced with the name of the VerusID you want to export
    * `PBaaSChainName` should be replaced with the name of the destination PBaaS chain
    * `"exportid":"true"` indicates that you're exporting an ID
    * `"amount":100` is the amount of the source chain's currency (VRSC or VRSCTEST) to send to the exported ID on the PBaaS chain
      
    So this command will create a transaction that exports the specified ID to the PBaaS chain, along with the specified amount of funds. The ID can then be used on the PBaaS chain, while still being usable on the source chain as well.

    Exporting IDs in this way allows you to use the same identity across multiple Verus-based blockchains, which is a key feature for working with PBaaS chains in the Verus ecosystem. Do you have any more questions about PBaaS?

    **User:**
    Not about PBaaS, but, what are the steps to sign a transaction spending funds from a multi-signature VerusID, using the command line?

    **AI Assistant:**
    Sure, I'll explain this. Signing a transaction that spends funds from a multi-signature VerusID involves a few steps using the command line. Here's the general process:

    1. Create the transaction and get the raw hex data:

      verus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>
      ```
      The `sendcurrency` command creates the transaction sending funds from the multi-sig ID, and `z_getoperationstatus` retrieves the raw hex data for that transaction.

    2. Take the raw hex data to each of the wallets containing the additional signing IDs/addresses. In each wallet, use:
      ```
      verus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>
      ```
      This applies that wallet's signature to the transaction. Repeat this step for each required signer.

    3. After obtaining the necessary number of signatures, broadcast the fully signed transaction using:
      ```
      verus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>
      ```
      This transmits the signed transaction to the network to be included in a block.

    The key points are:
    1) Create the initial transaction from the multi-sig ID
    2) Retrieve the raw hex for that transaction
    3) Pass the raw hex around to collect signatures from each required signer
    4) Broadcast the signed transaction once enough signatures are collected

    This process allows a transaction to be authorized by multiple parties as required by the multi-signature VerusID, adding a layer of security and consensus to spending of funds. Does this answer your question?
