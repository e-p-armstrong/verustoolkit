    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\
    \ M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \n\"\"\"\nWhat does \"\

    \ \n\"\"\"\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\

    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant.\n\nThe basic\
    \ idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential to break many\
    \ cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore, VerusIDs\
    \ being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant to\
    \ attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\nVerus IDs\

    \ (based on text):\n\"\"\"\nWhat are the `move` and `prunespentwallettransactions`\
    \ commands in Verus, and how do they work?\n\"\"\"\n\nSupposed answer to the question\
    \ (this is what you are fact-checking):\n\"\"\"\nThe `move` and `prunespentwallettransactions`\
    \ commands are two essential commands in Verus that help you manage your wallet\
    \ transactions. Let's break them down:\n\n**The `move` Command:**\nThe `move`\
    \ command allows you to transfer a specified amount of VRSC from one account in\
    \ your wallet to another. This command has five arguments:\n\n1. `fromaccount`:\
    \ The account from which the funds will be transferred. You must set this to an\
    \ empty string (`\"\"`)) to represent the default account.\n2. `toaccount`: The\
    \ account to which the funds will be transferred. Like `fromaccount`, you must\
    \ set this to an empty string (`\"\"`) to represent the default account.\n3. `amount`:\
    \ The quantity of VRSC to be transferred between accounts.\n4. `minconf` (optional):\
    \ The minimum number of confirmations required for the funds to be used. The default\
    \ is 1.\n5. `comment` (optional): An optional comment that will be stored in the\
    \ wallet only.\n\nThe `move` command returns a boolean value indicating whether\
    \ the transfer was successful.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `move`\
    \ command:\n\n* Move 0.01 VRSC from the default account to the account named `tabby`:\n\
    ```bash\n> verus move \"\" \"tabby\" 0.01\n```\n* Move 0.01 VRSC from `timotei`\
    \ to `akiko` with a comment and funds having 6 confirmations:\n```bash\n> verus\
    \ move \"timotei\" \"akiko\" 0.01 6 \"happy birthday!\"\n```\nYou can also use\
    \ the `move` command as a JSON RPC call, like this:\n```bash\n> curl --user myusername\
    \ --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"move\"\
    , \"params\": [\"timotei\", \"akiko\", 0.01, 6, \"happy birthday!\"] }' -H 'content-type:\
    \ text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n**The `prunespentwallettransactions`\
    \ Command:**\nThe `prunespentwallettransactions` command removes all spent transactions\
    \ from your wallet. You can use this command to clear all transactions except\
    \ one by specifying a transaction ID.\n\nHere's how to use the `prunespentwallettransactions`\
    \ command:\n\n* Remove all spent transactions:\n```bash\n> verus prunespentwallettransactions\n\
    ```\n* Remove all spent transactions except one with a specific transaction ID\
    \ (`txid`):\n```bash\n> verus prunespentwallettransactions \"txid\"\n```\nPlease\
    \ note that you should back up your `wallet.dat` file before running this command.\n\
    \nThe `prunespentwallettransactions` command returns a JSON object with three\
    \ properties:\n\n* `total_transactions`: The total number of transactions in your\
    \ wallet.\n* `remaining_transactions`: The number of transactions remaining in\
    \ your wallet after cleaning.\n* `removed_transactions`: The number of transactions\
    \ removed.\n\nRemember to use these commands carefully, as they can affect your\
    \ wallet transactions. Always back up your wallet data before making any changes.\n\
