    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    What are the different properties and fields that define a currency in Verus,
    and what information do they convey about the currency''s characteristics, usage,
    and behavior?


    **ANSWER:**

    In Verus, a currency is defined by a set of properties and fields that provide
    information about its characteristics, usage, and behavior. These properties and
    fields can be categorized into several groups, including identification, parentage,
    systems, notarization and proof protocols, block ranges, currencies and conversions,
    weights, and initial supply.


    **Identification:**

    The `currencyidhex` field provides a hex representation of the currency ID, which
    is unique to each currency. The `currencyid` field is the same as the ID behind
    the currency.


    **Parentage:**

    The `parent` field specifies the parent blockchain ID of the currency. This information
    is useful in understanding the currency''s origin and its relationship with other
    currencies.


    **Systems:**

    The `systemid` field specifies the system on which this currency is considered
    to run, while the `launchsystemid` field specifies the system from which this
    currency was launched. These fields provide information about the currency''s
    operational environment and its launch history.


    **Notarization and Proof Protocols:**

    The `notarizationprotocol` and `proofprotocol` fields specify the protocol numbers
    that determine variations in cross-chain or bridged notarizations and proofs.
    These fields are important in understanding how the currency interacts with other
    chains and currencies.


    **Block Ranges:**

    The `startblock` and `endblock` fields specify the block numbers on this chain
    that mark the beginning and end of the currency''s useful life. These fields provide
    information about the currency''s lifecycle and its usage patterns.


    **Currencies and Conversions:**

    The `currencies` field specifies the currencies that can be converted to this
    currency at launch or make up a liquidity basket. The `conversions` field specifies
    the pre-launch conversion rates for non-fractional currencies. The `minpreconversion`
    field specifies the minimum amounts required in pre-conversions for the currency
    to launch. These fields provide information about the currency''s relationships
    with other currencies and its conversion dynamics.


    **Weights:**

    The `weights` field specifies the relative currency weights, which are only returned
    for a liquidity basket. This field provides information about the currency''s
    weightage in a liquidity basket.


    **Initial Supply:**

    The `initialsupply` field specifies the initial currency supply for fractional
    currencies before preallocation or issuance. This field provides information about
    the currency''s initial distribution and supply dynamics.


    **Other Fields:**

    The `currencynames` field provides a mapping of i-addresses to fully qualified
    names of all sub-currencies. The `prelaunchcarveout` field specifies the pre-launch
    carve-out amount.


    In summary, the properties and fields that define a currency in Verus provide
    a comprehensive understanding of the currency''s characteristics, usage, and behavior,
    including its identification, parentage, systems, notarization and proof protocols,
    block ranges, currencies and conversions, weights, and initial supply.'
