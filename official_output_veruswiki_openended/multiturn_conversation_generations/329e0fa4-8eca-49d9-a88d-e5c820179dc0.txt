    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    How do I define a PBaaS blockchain using Verus, and what are the different components
    that make up this definition?


    **ANSWER:**

    To define a PBaaS blockchain using Verus, you need to create a JSON object that
    describes the properties of the blockchain. This object contains several key components
    that determine how the blockchain functions.


    The first component is the `name` field, which specifies the name of the blockchain.
    In this example, the name is "PBaaSChain".


    Next, the `options` field is an integer that defines various settings for the
    blockchain. In this case, it is set to 264, but the specific meaning of this value
    is not specified.


    The `currencies` field is an array that lists the currencies that can be used
    on the blockchain. In this example, only VRSCTEST is listed, but this could include
    other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies.


    The `conversions` field is an array that defines the conversion rates between
    the different currencies listed in the `currencies` field. In this case, only
    one conversion rate is specified, which is 1.


    The `eras` field is an array that defines the different eras of the blockchain.
    Each era has its own settings, such as the block reward, decay rate, halving rate,
    and end time. In this example, only one era is specified, with a block reward
    of 1,200,000,000 and no decay, halving, or end time.


    The `notaries` field is an array that lists the VerusIDs of the notaries that
    will validate transactions on the blockchain. In this example, three notaries
    are specified: Notary1@, Notary2@, and Notary3@.


    The `minnotariesconfirm` field specifies the minimum number of notaries required
    to confirm a transaction. In this example, this is set to 2.


    The `nodes` field is an array that lists the nodes that make up the blockchain
    network. Each node has a `networkaddress` and a `nodeidentity`, which specify
    the node''s IP address and VerusID, respectively.


    The `gatewayconvertername` and `gatewayconverterissuance` fields specify the name
    and initial issuance of the gateway converter, which is a mechanism for moving
    funds on and off the blockchain. In this example, the gateway converter is named
    "Bridge" and has an initial issuance of 1,000,000.


    Finally, the bridge definition has overridable defaults that specify the currencies
    supported by the bridge, the initial contributions to the bridge, and the initial
    supply of the bridge''s native token. These defaults can be overridden when defining
    the bridge.


    To use these definitions, you would pass them to the `definecurrency` command
    in Verus, along with the bridge definition overrides. This would create a new
    PBaaS blockchain with the specified properties.'
