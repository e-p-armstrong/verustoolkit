    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    What are the different fundraising options available for a new currency launch
    on the Verus platform, and how do they affect the value of the currency?


    **ANSWER:**

    When launching a new currency on the Verus platform, there are several fundraising
    options available. These options allow the currency creator to raise funds for
    the launch and reward early participants. Here''s a breakdown of each option and
    how they impact the value of the currency:


    **Fractionally Backed Currencies:**

    Except for new blockchain launches, which create native currency for operating
    the proof of stake, most currencies using fundraising options will be fractionally
    backed. This means that the currency''s value will appreciate when more people
    convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it.


    **Fundraising Options:**

    There are three primary fundraising options available:


    1. **Pre-launch Discount:** This option offers a discount to early participants
    who contribute to the launch before it goes live on its start block. This discount
    is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure
    that the currency remains in demand when it launches.


    2. **Pre-launch Carve-out:** This option allows a percentage of each initial participation
    currency to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price-neutral
    manner. The carved-out amount is sent directly to the launching identity upon
    successful launch.


    3. **Pre-allocation:** This option enables some of the newly launched currency
    to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional,
    this happens in a price-neutral manner, and the allocated amount is subtracted
    from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time-locked IDs for vesting
    or unlock periods.


    **Impact on Currency Value:**

    The choice of fundraising option can affect the value of the currency. For example,
    a pre-launch discount can increase demand for the currency, causing its value
    to appreciate. On the other hand, a pre-launch carve-out or pre-allocation can
    reduce the reserve ratio, potentially causing the currency''s value to depreciate.
    It''s essential to carefully consider the fundraising options and their impact
    on the currency''s value when launching a new currency on the Verus platform.'
