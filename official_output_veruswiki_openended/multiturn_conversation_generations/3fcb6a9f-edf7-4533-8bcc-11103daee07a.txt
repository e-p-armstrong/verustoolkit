    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    How do I define a PBaaS blockchain and export an ID to it using Verus?


    **ANSWER:**

    To define a PBaaS blockchain using Verus, you need to create two JSON objects:
    one for the blockchain definition and another for the bridge definition. The blockchain
    definition JSON object contains properties such as:


    * `name`: the name of the blockchain

    * `options`: an integer that configures the blockchain''s behavior

    * `currencies`: an array of currencies that can be converted to the blockchain''s
    native currency

    * `conversions`: an array of conversion ratios between the native currency and
    each currency on the chain

    * `eras`: an array of objects that define the block reward, reward decay, halving,
    and end of each era in the chain''s lifecycle

    * `notaries`: an array of VerusIDs that will serve as notaries on the chain

    * `minnotariesconfirm`: an integer that specifies the minimum number of notaries
    needed to confirm a block

    * `nodes`: an array of objects that describe the network addresses of the nodes
    on the chain, as well as their IDs

    * `gatewayconvertername`: the name of the bridge that can be used to move funds
    on and off the PBaaS chain

    * `gatewayconverterissuance`: the initial issuance of the bridge''s native token


    The bridge definition JSON object has its own properties, such as:


    * `currencies`: an array of currency tickers that the bridge supports (including
    the native coins of the chains being bridged)

    * `initialcontributions`: an array of initial liquidity for each currency in the
    bridge

    * `initialsupply`: the initial supply of the bridge''s native token


    Once you have created these two JSON objects, you can pass them to the `definecurrency`
    command in Verus to create the PBaaS blockchain.


    To export an ID to a PBaaS chain, you can use the `sendcurrency` command in Verus.
    This command takes several parameters, including:


    * `address`: the ID that you want to export

    * `exportto`: the name of the PBaaS chain that you want to export the ID to

    * `exportid`: a boolean that specifies whether to export the ID or not

    * `amount`: the amount of currency to send with the ID

    * `currency`: the currency to use for the export


    Here is an example of how to export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the `sendcurrency`
    command:

    ```

    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]''

    ```

    This command exports the ID `IDNAME@` to the PBaaS chain `PBaaSChainName` with
    100 units of `vrsctest` currency.'

    **User:**

    Hi, I''m trying to create a PBaaS blockchain using Verus and export an ID to it,

    **AI Assistant:**

    Defining a PBaaS blockchain and exporting an ID to it using Verus involves a few
    steps. Let me break it down for you.


    To define a PBaaS blockchain using Verus, you need to create two JSON objects:
    one for the blockchain definition and another for the bridge definition. The blockchain
    definition JSON object contains properties such as:


    * `name`: the name of the blockchain

    * `options`: an integer that configures the blockchain''s behavior

    * `currencies`: an array of currencies that can be converted to the blockchain''s
    native currency

    * `conversions`: an array of conversion ratios between the native currency and
    each currency on the chain

    * `eras`: an array of objects that define the block reward, reward decay, halving,
    and end of each era in the chain''s lifecycle

    * `notaries`: an array of VerusIDs that will serve as notaries on the chain

    * `minnotariesconfirm`: an integer that specifies the minimum number of notaries
    needed to confirm a block

    * `nodes`: an array of objects that describe the network addresses of the nodes
    on the chain, as well as their IDs

    * `gatewayconvertername`: the name of the bridge that can be used to move funds
    on and off the PBaaS chain

    * `gatewayconverterissuance`: the initial issuance of the bridge''s native token


    The bridge definition JSON object has its own properties, such as:


    * `currencies`: an array of currency tickers that the bridge supports (including
    the native coins of the chains being bridged)

    * `initialcontributions`: an array of initial liquidity for each currency in the
    bridge

    * `initialsupply`: the initial supply of the bridge''s native token


    Once you have created these two JSON objects, you can pass them to the `definecurrency`
    command in Verus to create the PBaaS blockchain.


    Now, to export an ID to a PBaaS chain, you can use the `sendcurrency` command
    in Verus. This command takes several parameters, including:


    * `address`: the ID that you want to export

    * `exportto`: the name of the PBaaS chain that you want to export the ID to

    * `exportid`: a boolean that specifies whether to export the ID or not

    * `amount`: the amount of currency to send with the ID

    * `currency`: the currency to use for the export


    Here is an example of how to export an ID to a PBaaS chain using the `sendcurrency`
    command:

    ```

    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"PBaaSChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"vrsctest"}]''

    ```

    This command exports the ID `IDNAME@` to the PBaaS chain `PBaaSChainName` with
    100 units of `vrsctest` currency.


    Do you have any questions about this process, or would you like more information
