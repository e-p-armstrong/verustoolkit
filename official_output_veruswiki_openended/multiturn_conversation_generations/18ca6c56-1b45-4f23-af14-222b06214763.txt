    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    What is a sample chain definition in Verus, and how does it work?


    **ANSWER:**

    In Verus, a chain definition is a set of parameters that define the properties
    of a new blockchain. The sample chain definition provided is an example of how
    to define a new chain using the Verus command-line interface.


    Here''s a breakdown of the sample chain definition:


    ```

    ./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain ''{"name":"RESERVEWITHPREMINE","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM","premine":50000000000000,"initialcontribution":5000000000000,"conversion":100000000,"minpreconvert":45000000000000,"maxpreconvert":100000000000000,"launchfee":0,"billingperiod":14400,"notarizationreward":100000000000,"eras":[{"reward":5000000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0,"eraoptions":1}],"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"ipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"},{"networkaddress":"2ndipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"}]}''

    ```


    This chain definition has several key properties:


    * **Name**: The name of the new chain, in this case "RESERVEWITHPREMINE".

    * **Payment Address**: The address where the premine and other funds will be sent.

    * **Premine**: The initial amount of funds allocated to the payment address.

    * **Initial Contribution**: The minimum amount of funds required to launch the
    chain.

    * **Conversion**: The conversion rate between the initial contribution currency
    and the native chain currency.

    * **Min/Max Preconvert**: The minimum and maximum amounts of funds that can be
    converted at launch.

    * **Launch Fee**: The fee required to launch the chain (set to 0 in this example).

    * **Billing Period**: The period of time between billing cycles (set to 14400,
    or 4 hours, in this example).

    * **Notarization Reward**: The reward given to notaries for their services.

    * **Eras**: An array of era definitions, each with its own reward, decay, halving,
    and era end parameters.

    * **Nodes**: An array of node definitions, each with its own network address and
    payment address.


    The chain definition also has some rules and constraints:


    * A maximum of 3 eras are allowed.

    * A minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations are required.

    * A minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization is required.

    * VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet to make a chain.


    The example chain definition provided emits a premine to the indicated address
    and converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency
    at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency''s
    reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting
    reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will
    fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.'

    **User:**

    I''m trying to understand how to create a new blockchain in Verus. Can you explain

    **AI Assistant:**

    A chain definition in Verus is a set of parameters that define the properties
    of a new blockchain. I can provide a sample chain definition and break it down
    for you.


    Here''s a sample chain definition:

    ```

    ./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain ''{"name":"RESERVEWITHPREMINE","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM","premine":50000000000000,"initialcontribution":5000000000000,"conversion":100000000,"minpreconvert":45000000000000,"maxpreconvert":100000000000000,"launchfee":0,"billingperiod":14400,"notarizationreward":100000000000,"eras":[{"reward":5000000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0,"eraoptions":1}],"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"ipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"},{"networkaddress":"2ndipaddress:port","paymentaddress":"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM"}]}''

    ```

    Let me explain what each part of this chain definition does:


    * **Name**: The name of the new chain, in this case "RESERVEWITHPREMINE".

    * **Payment Address**: The address where the premine and other funds will be sent.

    * **Premine**: The initial amount of funds allocated to the payment address.

    * **Initial Contribution**: The minimum amount of funds required to launch the
    chain.

    * **Conversion**: The conversion rate between the initial contribution currency
    and the native chain currency.

    * **Min/Max Preconvert**: The minimum and maximum amounts of funds that can be
    converted at launch.

    * **Launch Fee**: The fee required to launch the chain (set to 0 in this example).

    * **Billing Period**: The period of time between billing cycles (set to 14400,
    or 4 hours, in this example).

    * **Notarization Reward**: The reward given to notaries for their services.

    * **Eras**: An array of era definitions, each with its own reward, decay, halving,
    and era end parameters.

    * **Nodes**: An array of node definitions, each with its own network address and
    payment address.


    This chain definition also has some rules and constraints:


    * A maximum of 3 eras are allowed.

    * A minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations are required.

    * A minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization is required.

    * VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet to make a chain.


    In summary, this chain definition emits a premine to the indicated address and
    converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency
    at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency''s
    reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting
    reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will
    fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.


    Do you have any questions about this sample chain definition or how to create
    a new blockchain in Verus?'
