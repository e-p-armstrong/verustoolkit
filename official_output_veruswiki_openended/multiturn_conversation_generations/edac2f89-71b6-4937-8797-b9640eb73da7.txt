    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    How do PBaaS blockchains on Verus work, and what features do they offer in terms
    of DeFi AMM conversions, currency validation, and fundraising?


    **ANSWER:**

    On Verus, PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) blockchains are fully independent,
    merge mineable, and rent-free. These blockchains offer several features that set
    them apart from other blockchain solutions.


    **DeFi AMM Conversions:**

    All DeFi AMM (Automated Market Maker) conversions on Verus PBaaS blockchains are
    verified via mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol. This means
    that all conversions in a single liquidity basket are calculated simultaneously
    for all transactions in any given block. As a result, all participants receive
    the same price in all directions of conversion. The conversion fee is minimal,
    ranging from 0.025% to 0.05%.


    **Currency Validation:**

    On Verus PBaaS blockchains, all currencies and identities are primitives at L1
    and are validated and verified on UTXO transactions. This means that all inputs
    and outputs are checked, just like single-currency L1 blockchain transactions,
    such as those on Ethereum or Bitcoin.


    **Interoperability:**

    All currencies on all independent connected chains, once launched, can be sent
    back and forth to other multi-currency capable networks, including other independent
    PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s.


    **Mapped Currencies:**

    Verus also allows for "mapped currencies", which map 1:1 to an existing currency
    on Ethereum (e.g., DAI). These mapped currencies can be sent from Ethereum with
    simple transactions and received and used as the new mapped currency, or sent
    back to Ethereum and used there as the original currency.


    **Fundraising Options:**

    Currency launches on Verus PBaaS blockchains can raise funds in three ways. Each
    of these fundraising options creates a currency that is not 100% backed, and its
    price responds to market forces. The three fundraising options are:


    1. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch
    grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, whether time-locked
    or not. These currencies take their funding from a percentage of the reserve backing.

    2. 100% backed currencies, which do not change their relative price to the underlying
    basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves.

    3. New blockchain launches, which create new native currency for operating the
    proof of stake of the blockchain.


    Overall, Verus PBaaS blockchains offer a range of features that make them a powerful
    tool for building decentralized applications and creating new currencies.'
